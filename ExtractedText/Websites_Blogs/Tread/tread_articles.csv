2024 Year In Review,2024-12-31T17:20:35+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2024-year-in-review/,"‚ÄúNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world; indeed, it‚Äôs the only thing that ever has.‚Äú
2024 was arguably Tread‚Äôs best year yet.
Tons more pitchers signed & drafted, despite the ever increasingly competitive landscape.
College commitments galore, and dozens of incredibly smart and talented people who joined our team from every corner of the country.
Let‚Äôs dive into what made 2024 a year to remember, and what Tread has in store for 2025.
In 2023, we added 14 members to the Tread team.
This past year, we decided to go ahead and flip that number around, adding 41 new and talented members.
With almost every hire relocating away from home to come join our team in Charlotte, we don‚Äôt take their decisions for granted ‚Äì and we‚Äôve made a commitment to each and every one of them that Tread will do everything it can to foster their personal and professional growth.
These new members include:
A few honorable mentions:
Quite a few of our coaches have now made the jump from coaching in pro baseball to Tread, including John Lantigua (Pirates), Pat Robles (Astros), and Matt Jordan (Giants), in an industry where the opposite is expected.
The feedback we have gotten is that this is a result of:
We‚Äôre working hard to continue making Tread an even better place to work where coaches can build mid to long-term careers.
Both Declan Morrissey and Ethan Dyer joined us after starting their coaching careers at Cressey Sports Performance, while both John Cheatwood and Victor Sanchez left career paths as College Pitching Coaches to join Tread.
We have continued to add bilingual coaches to better serve the Latin community (John Lantigua, Pat Robles & Welinton Mariano).
Hunter Hoopes was hired as a Performance Coach, but 2 weeks after starting, he hit an all-time high velocity, sitting 98-100 mph in a bullpen and nearly set the world record for the fastest baseball ever thrown, shuffling 107+ MPH in his warm-ups for that bullpen.
Needless to say, he signed a minor league contract with the Twins shortly thereafter.
He was shifted to a part-time Facilities Manager for the offseason as his playing career continues this Spring.
You could say that the video of this bullpen went viral. Here it is if you missed it:
In all, the team is now eclipsing 75 members ‚Äì and we‚Äôre excited about the extremely impressive level of talent relocating to Charlotte to start their Tread careers and help athletes re-write their stories.
Last year, Dr. James Werner joined us as our Director of Rehab here at our headquarters in Charlotte, NC.
He‚Äôs had his plate full, serving as a point of contact for both in-house and remote athletes and helping revamp our return to throw & rehabilitation protocols.
Dr. Werner‚Äôs one-on-one sessions have remained 100% included with our training and in-house fees, providing a unique amenity that few other training facilities offer.
We also invested in additional tools that will allow us to level up rehab within the baseball world.
Specifically, we added a Diagnostic Ultrasound, allowing us to get real-time, dynamic imaging and functional measurements of athletes‚Äô ligaments (i.e. UCLs), tendons, fascia, nerves, and more.
Not only have we begun using it to monitor athletes‚Äô UCL health and function, but here‚Äôs a cool case study of how Dr. Werner was able to use it to diagnose and fix an athlete‚Äôs arm pain.
Check that out here:

If you‚Äôre interested in rehabbing with Tread, contact us here to learn more.
In 2023, we purchased and set up a Biomechanics Lab and got to work collecting data.
This year, we added a key piece in Courtney Semkewyc, PhD, who is our lead biomechanist and helps run our Data department.
We also added Mound Force Plates to our Pitching Lab to assess ground forces in the delivery, weight room Force Plates to assess lower body power output (and more), as well as other strength testing equipment to better understand how our athletes move, how they produce force, and to identify any injury red flags when they visit Tread HQ.
As we continue to collect 1000‚Äôs of unique Motion Capture sessions per year and pair this with relevant performance data, injury history, UCL screening, pitch metrics, and more, we will be uniquely positioned in several years with what will likely be the largest and most comprehensive data set on elite baseball pitchers in the world (including Major League Baseball).
I discussed my thoughts on MLB Elbow Injuries on Twitter/X and in an interview with MLB Network Radio.
One of my conclusions was that we simply need more data ‚Äì and lots of it ‚Äì to better understand as an industry exactly where the risk/reward tradeoffs lie from a training, workload, and preparation standpoint.
Expect this data set ‚Äì and the insights we will be able to derive from it ‚Äì to have massive implications for the baseball world as a whole over the next decade.
As the game works to continue increasing player performance‚Äîwhile also limiting arm injuries‚ÄîTread expects to remain at the forefront of this conversation.
In 2023, 13 of our remote athletes were drafted, 48 signed free agent deals, 8 debuted in the MLB and 2 were named All-Stars.
We managed to match or eclipse all of these in 2024 ‚Äì just barely, as the bar continues to get set higher and higher each year (see our¬†full list of signs & draft picks¬†here).
Debuts included Ben Casparius (Dodgers), Spencer Bivens (Giants), Gordon Graceffo (Cardinals), James Meeker (Brewers), Cade Povich (Orioles), Brady Basso (Athletics), Robert Gasser (Brewers), and Landon Knack (Dodgers).
We also had 3 World Series Champs in Ben Casparius & Landon Knack, both rookies, as well as Anthony Banda, who at this time last year was a Free Agent throwing in our Annual Pro day.
If you don‚Äôt think a lot can happen in 12 months, just ask these guys.
Notably, Spencer Bivens‚Äô story received quite a bit of media attention.
After going undrafted and bouncing around Europe and Indy leagues for 4 years, he ultimately was able to go from 90-92 to 94-97 in an off-season with Tread and get signed by the Giants before debuting this year at 29 years old.
Here he is describing what his first big league start meant to him, in which he struck Shohei Ohtani out‚Ä¶twice.

In addition to these MLB Debuts, we also had 3 remote athletes selected as All-Stars ‚Äì Cole Ragans, Tanner Scott, and Clay Holmes (2x), all of whom have radically transformed their careers with Tread to become some of the best pitchers in baseball.
Since starting with Tread:
Before Tread, the three had a combined 0.1 career Wins Above Replacement (WAR), meaning they had been performing like average and replaceable big league pitchers.
After Tread, they have combined for +16.9 WAR, a cumulative estimated value in free agency of $99 million.
Pitching development is cool.
(Clay Holmes just signed a 3-year, $38 million dollar contract, with Scott projected to get an even bigger deal this offseason, so these numbers are very real).
In 2020, Clay Holmes emailed us with a 5.91 ERA & -0.9 career WAR.In 2022, Cole Ragans had just logged a 4.95 ERA & averaged 92 mph w/ -0.1 career WAR.When Tanner Scott reached out, he had a career ERA of 4.61 & a 6-year WAR of 1.1.A üßµ on how all three became All-Stars ‚¨áÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/EXMrEMM8xL
While there are too many to recount here, we post weekly stories on our social media throughout the year.
Here are a few that stand out:
With over 2,000 athletes, this list is just the tip of the iceberg, so make sure to follow our social media accounts for weekly updates of many more athletes.
This thread by Tread‚Äôs Assistant Director of Performance Leif Strom sent shockwaves through the baseball world earlier this year, as he described what Tread calls the ‚ÄúKick Change.‚Äù
While studying slow-mo film of some of the best changeups in baseball, he happened across a slo-mo clip of Tread‚Äôs Shaun Anderson, who appeared to spike the middle finger and create incredible movement without pronating the pitch.
While some pointed out that Spiked Changeups have been thrown before, it is an exceptionally rare grip that is virtually nowhere to be found at the higher levels of baseball, largely because nobody had described the why (why would you want to spike it?) or the how (how to consistently teach and throw it).
I mean, just take a look at this Kick-Change from remote athlete Michael Forret, which reached -10.9‚Ä≥ of vertical break (that‚Äôs more depth than most curveballs).
For reference, Devin Wiliams‚Äô changeup, dubbed ‚ÄúThe Airbender‚Äú, and widely regarded as one of the best of all time, only reached below -10‚Ä≥ of break twice in 2024.
These are absolutely unheard-of numbers for a changeup, much less one that can be taught in a couple bullpen sessions, and few are able to emulate how Devin Williams throws his, which requires outlier pronation to pull off.
It didn‚Äôt take long for the pitch to catch on.
This is a pitch that has had tons of success with current Tread athletes, and we expect it to continue gaining popularity into 2025 and beyond.
Not only can it add 6-12 inches of depth to many pitchers‚Äô existing changeups, but it can be thrown without forcing pronation, making it easier to teach and throw, especially for pitchers who struggle with pronation.
You can learn more about the pitch here.

Another big first this year was the addition of our first annual Transfer Portal Showcase this past summer.
College pitchers who train with Tread are eligible to throw in this event, where we collect professional video and data to be shared with college coaches, who either physically attend or opt-in to receive this info online.
It was a huge success.
Between attendees and opt-ins, over 90 schools were represented at the event.
All in all, 61 out of 65 participants found a school by the fall.
Schools that physically attended had a huge advantage, with some players setting up visits before leaving the building.
As the Transfer Portal continues to be a bigger and bigger piece of College Baseball, we only expect this event to grow and be a destination for both College coaches looking to land talent and Tread‚Äôs growing list of college arms.
Take a look at some of the highlights from the event here:

This fall we did something unprecedented, offering FREE Motion Capture Analyses to Pro Pitchers (Indy, MiLB and MLB) following the end of the pro season.
Pro Pitchersüö®Get a Motion Capture Analysis ‚Äì FREE this fall for Pros [$2,000+ value, limited slots]We might be crazy, but it‚Äôs happening.Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs included:pic.twitter.com/c8P3D5skG9
Up until this point, other facilities have always charged anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000 for this service.
We decided to instead make our entire in-house assessment process free for Pros.
This created waves through the baseball world, with dozens of players scrambling to reschedule their early offseason plans to come to Tread
This included Force plate and dynamometer reports, Biomechanical reports, body composition testing, UCL imaging, arsenal reporting with slow-motion video and follow-ups to discuss the results with our staff.
In all, over 50 pro pitchers took us up on the offer, saving them an estimated $100,000 ‚Äì $200,000 on Motion Capture fees elsewhere.
One of my favorite reactions was a message from a AAA coach to our staff:
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù
Our response: there is no catch.
Sure, many players were so impressed that they chose to begin training with Tread, but for those who were already comfortable with their training programming, we happily ran them through the process ‚Äì no questions asked.
As the word continues to spread, we expect more and more athletes to come see what we have going on in Charlotte, NC, and who knows?
We may even extend this offer to college players in 2025.ü§î
What do we have in store for 2025? While there are some projects we can‚Äôt announce yet, here are a few goals we can discuss:
I also wanted to take the time to thank our team ‚Äì and especially our Co-Founder and CEO,¬†Coan McAlpine, for everything he does behind the scenes to help make Tread what it is today.
Tread exists to help athletes re-write their stories. Now it‚Äôs time to double down on that mission in 2024.
Here‚Äôs to reaching your potential,

Tread HQ: Pro Day '24 Recap,2024-01-22T14:30:18+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2024-pro-day/,"At Tread‚Äôs Annual Pro Weekend, the fourth such occasion in our company‚Äôs history, 124 Tread Athletes toed the rubber in front of representatives from 28 MLB organizations. Over the course of three days, our Free Agent Pitchers were given the opportunity to showcase the results of their hard work and unyielding dedication to their craft.
Tread, at its core, is a about striving for excellence. We are a community of dream chasers who are passionate about pushing boundaries and achieving peak performance, and nothing better exemplifies this commitment than our annual Pro Weekend.
For athletes with substantial Major League innings under their belts, this event marked a significant step toward returning to an MLB mound and competing against the world‚Äôs very best.
For those with varying levels of Minor League experience, it served as an opportunity to secure new contracts and resume their journey towards the ultimate goal.
And for those in pursuit of their first professional opportunity, their performances this weekend were a showcase, demonstrating to everyone why they deserve a shot at the next level.
So, what makes Tread‚Äôs Pro Weekend so special?
It could be the sheer number of participating athletes who held the attention of everyone in attendance for three straight days.
It could be upper-90s heaters, disgusting breaking balls, and even a few gravity-defying knuckleballs (more on that later).
All that said ‚Äì let‚Äôs relive a few of the most electric bullpens on the first day here at Tread HQ.
Dakota Chalmers
Dakota Chalmers turned heads and lit up radar guns on day 1 of our Pro Day event here at Tread with one of the most impressive arsenals to ever enter the facility. Chalmers displays an arsenal eerily similar to that of Tyler Glasnow‚Äôs arsenal.
Please do yourself a favor and watch him dot 98 MPH heaters, throw 93 MPH gyro sliders, and 85 MPH bangers ‚Äì you will NOT regret it.
Drew Strotman
Drew Strotman had quite the day and really played with our emotions. Strotman started off his bullpen throwing 95-96 MPH sinkers ‚Äì impressive right?
Then threw a couple mid 80s sweepers ‚Äì also cool, huh?
THEN followed up with a 99.5 MPH bullet that turned everyone‚Äôs heads from the radar display board to the TrackMan to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a misread. And sure enough, it was not as he then averaged 98.3 MPH on his 4-seamer.
Aaron McGarity
This year we added in the option for our athletes participating in Pro Day to throw to hitters. And oh man, did Aaron McGarity show off‚Ä¶
The outing consisted of lots of whiffs and lots of K‚Äôs.
McGarity displays primarily an east-to-west profile with a changeup, smaller slider, and big sweeper, and then unlocks the top part of the zone with a cut 4-seamer from a low slot. And McGarity took perfect advantage of that on Friday.
üî• 95+ MPH THROWERS CLUB:
Day 1 was home to¬†nine¬†(9) pitchers who hit at least 95 MPH on the radar gun out of 28 pitchers total who threw.
üîå BEST PITCHES:
üî•Top Fastball¬†‚Äì Beau Burrow‚Äôs 4-Seam Fastball
PC: Leif Strom
Beau Burrows flashed our best fastball from day 1; he displayed a mid 90‚Äôs fastball with a true ride profile. From a 5‚Äô9‚Äù release height, his 19.5 IVB fastball should play excellently in the top third of the zone.
Average Metrics: 94.6 MPH 19.5‚Äù IVB 9.2‚Äù HB from 5‚Äô9‚Äù Release Height
üî®Top Breaking Ball¬†‚Äì Drew Strotman‚Äôs Slider
PC: Tyler Zombro
Drew Strotman showed off the best graded breaking ball from day 1. Off of his upper 90s fastball, he sports an 86 mph sweeper to round out his complete supinator arsenal.
Average Metrics: 85.7 MPH -.6‚Äù IVB -10.4‚Äù HB from a 5‚Äô4‚Äù Release Height
üîÅ¬†Top Offspeed ‚Äì¬†Jace Vines‚Äô Splitter
PC: Jace Vines
Jace Vines starts off our trend of great splitters on Pro Day weekend. With our best graded offspeed of day 1. Jace has a lower slot east-west profile that his depthy splitter complements greatly.
Average Metrics:¬† 86.6 MPH -7.9‚Äù IVB 8.1‚Äù HB from a 4‚Äô10‚Äù Release Height
Earlier morning start for day 2 ‚Äì nothing that a cup of coffee and absolute fuel couldn‚Äôt solve, however.
Carter Raffield
Clemson alum and Reds‚Äô draft pick Carter Raffield opened eyes in his time on the bump Saturday in averaging over 95 MPH on his fastball and executing his arsenal incredibly well. His two breaking balls variations stood out with a harder downer at 86 MPH and a massive curveball 83 MPH.
Julian Smith
LHP Julian Smith averaged 95 MPH on his heater making him the hardest throwing lefty on day 2 ‚Äì just behind Anthony Banda (95.4 MPH avg) in the entire event and just ahead of Denson Hull (94.3 MPH avg) on day 2.
The 95 MPH heater with good carry paired with a legit 85 MPH slider with 5‚Ä≥ IVB and 5‚Ä≥ gloveside break from a high slot which resulted in some sick whiffs in his Pro Day live ABs. Take a look for yourself. Also ended the day on a 96 MPH swing and a miss ‚Äì not too shabby!
Sam Kessler
Sam Kessler showed off quite the intriguing arsenal and movement plot that absolutely dominated hitters on day 2 of our Pro Day event.
He showed off an 83 MPH carry sweeper w/ 8‚Ä≥ of ride, a hard smaller/more traditional slider at 87 MPH and 0‚Ä≥ of IVB changeup at 89. You will just have to take a look for yourself at the movement plot and video.
üî• 95+ MPH THROWERS CLUB:
Double digit (11) pitchers crossed the 95+ MPH threshold on day 2 of the event.
üîå BEST PITCHES:
üî•Top Fastball¬†‚Äì Julian Smith‚Äôs 4-Seam Fastball
PC: Matt Marsili
With an electric live session, Julian showed off the best graded fastball from day 2. Julian came prepared with his two pitch mix of a gyro slider and a mid 90s ride fastball. Who doesn‚Äôt love ride from the left side?
Average Metrics: 95.0 MPH 18.2‚Äù IVB -9‚Äù HB from a 6‚Äô1‚Äù Release Height
üî®Top Breaking Ball¬†‚Äì Karl Blum‚Äôs Slider
With the biggest slider to appear on this list, Karl had the best graded sweeper from day 2. To round out his east-west arsenal, he sports an 80+ MPH slider with plenty of sweep. That thing takes OFF.
Average Metrics: 82.0 MPH 2.0‚Äù IVB -15.8‚Äù HB from a 5‚Äô5‚Äù Release Height
üîÅ¬†Top Offspeed ‚Äì¬†Christian Winston‚Äôs Splitter
PC: Austin Roark
Our second lefty on the list, Christian had our best graded offspeed from day 2. A firm splitter on the 0 IVB line, his splitter helps round out his breaking ball heavy arsenal.
Average Metrics: 85.3 MPH 0.8‚Äù IVB -16.1‚Äù HB from a 5‚Äô5‚Äù Release Height
Entering day 3 ‚Äì bet you thought we may have run out of arms. You would be wrong.
Cooper Adams
Cooper Adams got on the mound on day 3 and showed up as a new pitcher, not the arm that was at Mount St Mary‚Äôs last spring.
He ran his fastball up to 96.8 MPH while averaging 95.1, higher than his previous best of 94.9. Along with that, he showcased a sinker, slider and a kick change, all new or much improved. He has totally reinvented himself post college and deserves a shot.
Jordan Powell
Jordan Powell started his day flicking in a 91 MPH fastball.
Then proceeded to throw NASTY low 80s knuckleballs that danced throughout the zone ‚Äì it was an absolute joy to watch. It would be super intriguing to see how this plays in pro ball.
Mark Fischer
Our very own performance coach, Mark Fischer, put on a SHOW from down under on day 3.
Only 4 MLB pitchers had a sub 3 foot release height last year and velocities ranged from 82-85 MPH. However, Fischer averaged over 90 MPH from his sub 3 foot release height along with a 81 MPH sweeper and a -9.5 in IVB splitter. His fastball that hovered around the IVB line produced insanely shallow VAAs as well.
üî• 95+ MPH THROWERS CLUB:
5 more pitchers chucked 95+ MPH to round out our event on the final day.
üîå BEST PITCHES:
üî•Top Fastball¬†‚Äì Mark Fischer‚Äôs 4-Seam Fastball
PC: Mark Fischer
Our own performance coach, Mark Fischer, impressed everyone with day 3‚Äôs best graded fastball. Mark‚Äôs heater hugs the zero line at low 90s velo from a sub 3 foot release height. For the data nerds out there, he can generate insane angles at the top of the zone ‚Äì perhaps some of the best ever.
Average Metrics: 90.3 MPH -2.1‚Äù IVB 17.1‚Äù HB from a 2‚Äô7‚Äù Release Height
üî®Top Breaking Ball¬†‚Äì Cooper Adams‚Äô Slider
PC: Sam Eades
To round out our event‚Äôs showcased breakers, Cooper Adams displayed an impressive 82 MPH sweeper. This flying saucer helps top of his full arsenal and compliments his mid 90 MPH fastball.
Average Metrics: 81.7 MPH 1.2‚Äù IVB -14.2‚Äù HB from a 5‚Äô4‚Äù Release Height
üîÅ¬†Top Offspeed ‚Äì¬†Andrew Kramer‚Äôs Splitter
PC: Hunter Townsend
Visually the most insane pitch from the whole weekend. Andrew threw a splitter averaging nearly -8‚Äù IVB while moving more than 9‚Ä≥ armside from an above 6 foot release height. It looked like a lefty hammer from the right side!
Average Metrics: 81.4 MPH -7.6‚Äù IVB 9.4‚Äù HB from a 6‚Äô1‚Äù Release Height
You thought you would get through this blog and have us NOT mention our guys‚Äô who threw the death pitch (curveball with armside or minimal gloveside movement)?
That‚Äôs crazy.
Enjoy these 5 üíÄ‚öæÔ∏è‚Äôs from our Pro Day event.
Members (in order as seen in video): Blaize Minick, Matt Seelinger, Luke Farrell, Kevin Herget, Jake Faria
Could not close out this blog with out giving a massive shoutout to one of our catchers‚Ä¶
Free agent Ciaran Devenney, previously of UConn baseball and the Frontier League, put on a SHOW this past Pro Day weekend. He spent the 3 days absolutely ripping covers off the ball and looking great behind the plate.
Also, just an A+ dude.
Enjoy this highlight reel of Mr. Devenney.
PS: Thank you to all of our catchers and hitters from this past Pro Day weekend ‚Äì could not have done it without their services.
If you made it this far into the blog, we thank you and hope you enjoyed the recounting of our fourth annual Pro Day event ‚Äì till next year! ü´° üöÄ

2023 Tread Athletics Year in Review,2024-01-04T16:52:31+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2023-year-in-review/,"2023 was a wild year for Tread.
Many more athletes drafted and signed.
Countless college commitments, and tons of new members added to the team.
Let‚Äôs dive into what made this year special and where we‚Äôre headed in 2024.
Last year we added 19 members to the Tread team. This year we added another 14, including 9 more coaches.
These include Leif Strom, Sean Fisher, John Lantigua, James Morisano, Nash Bryan, Aaron Bechtel, Tyler Germanowski, Victor Sanchez and Ryan Flippo.
We also have 10 new performance coaches starting this January (I know, crazy), as we plan to continue scaling our remote and in-house training to new heights.
Notably, while most private companies exclusively lose team members to pro organizations, Tread is actually seeing coaches leave pro baseball to start careers in the private sector.
John Lantigua (Pirates) and Pat Robles (Astros ‚Äì starting 2024) both made the switch.
Both John and Pat are also fully bilingual, allowing us to more readily serve Latin players moving forward.
We also further increased compensation for Tread coaches, with an incentive structure added allowing our coaches‚Äô earning potential to exceed $100k+ in year 3 and beyond.
Other notable hires
Ross Seaton also joins us from Pro Ball, most recently holding an upper-level role as the Director of Pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks.
In all, the team is now eclipsing 50 members ‚Äì and we‚Äôre excited about the extremely impressive level of talent relocating to Charlotte to start their Tread careers.
Piggybacking off of the last point, we‚Äôre still looking for a number of new hires in 2024.
Currently, these include 5-10 more Performance Coaches and a Performance Analyst, although we will be announcing more openings on our social media pages throughout the year.
You can learn more about those positions on our Careers Page.
As I alluded to above, we hired Dr. James Werner to serve as our Director of Rehab here at our headquarters in Charlotte, NC.
As such, Dr. Werner is tasked with supplying rehab to in-house athletes, serving as a point of contact for injured remote athletes, and helping revamp our return to throw & rehabilitation protocols.
We spent several months scouring the country to fill this position and received many top-flight candidates including current MLB Physical Therapists.
Ultimately, Dr. Werner‚Äôs clinical skills are a massive addition to our operation, allowing Tread to be a destination not just for performance, but for rehab as well.
You can check out his bio on our careers page.
If you didn‚Äôt catch it above, we‚Äôve added 2 fully bilingual coaches to our staff, allowing us to serve the Latin community more completely.
This is a big deal, as we attempt to expand smart, accessible training for pitchers to a wider audience in pursuit of our shared mission:
Tread exists to help athletes re-write their stories.
While we‚Äôve supplied T-shirts internally for years to our in-house athletes, we haven‚Äôt made merch available for sale for the first 8-years of our existence.
With the addition of a Marketing Department, we now have tons of merch being added to our site, including hats, sweatshirts, headbands and tees.
We also did limited edition merch drops for Veteran‚Äôs Day and a Breast Cancer Awareness t-shirt fundraiser.
Keep following our social media accounts for future gear releases.
You can check out our full selection of merch here.
Last year, 9 of our remote athletes were drafted and another 38 signed free agent deals in 2022. We managed to eclipse that in 2023 ‚Äì pretty cool. (See our¬†full list of signs & draft picks¬†here).
We also had 5 of our pros debut this year, including Slade Cecconi (Arizona Diamondbacks), Declan Cronin (Chicago White Sox), Alex Speas (Texas Rangers), Joe Jacques (Boston Red Sox), and Matt Krook (New York Yankees).
Notably, long time Tread athlete, 36th rounder and current offseason staff member Declan Cronin made his debut.
Here he is describing his story as well as a fun tweet on his call up by Jeff Passan.
In addition to these MLB Debuts, we also had 2 remote athletes selected as All-Stars ‚Äì Josh Hader and Mitch Keller as well as 5 remote trainees on the World Series champion Texas Rangers: Jordan Montgomery, Josh Sborz, Chris Stratton, Dane Dunning & Will Smith (who has now won back-to-back-to-back World Series).
While there are too many to recount here, we try to post the best stories on social media throughout the year. Here are a few that stand out:
Cole Ragans went from 92-94 in 2022 to 96-101 mph as a starter and won August AL Pitcher of the Month:

This list is just the tip of the iceberg, so make sure to follow our social media accounts for regular updates of many more athletes.
We‚Äôve been fortunate enough to continue branching out within the pro baseball world.
Since 2017, we have amassed a huge sample size of pro level players, which helps us to continue refining our approach to velocity development, pitch design, physical preparation & more.
While we pride ourselves on our ability to help these guys with the most complex problems, we place¬†every bit as high of a priority on all of our high school and college players¬†as well, with over 750+ college commitments at this point in our history.
One of my main personal projects over the course of 2023 was revamping Tread‚Äôs approach to remote mental skills preparation and development. Members of our team and I spent the better part of 8 months designing the curriculum and training program for this course, and it launched to rave reviews this fall.
If you haven‚Äôt checked it out, you can do so here.

Top In House Highlights:
After almost a year of research and deliberation into which system we would be installing, we installed a Qualisys Markerless Motion Capture System at Tread 2.0, creating one of just a handful of private baseball facilities in the world that have such an in-house system.
This software and series of cameras is able to accurately assess a pitcher‚Äôs biomechanics without the need for dozens of markers to be placed on a pitcher‚Äôs body. This is important because it allows the potential for hundreds of motion captures to be collected on a weekly basis.
This means athletes have the ability to throw on the mocap system weekly, with their biomechanics being objectively monitored every time they come in-house.
Our current lead biomechanist not only throws 98 mph and holds an advanced degree in Biomechanics, but we are adding a PhD level biomechanist starting in early 2024.
While we are still in the process of data collection and customizing the lab to our unique setup, this will continue to prove a major difference maker for our athletes in 2024 and beyond.
While¬†the space is exclusive to remote athletes¬†at this time, feel free to¬†reach out¬†to express your interest in joining our athlete community.
What do we have in store for 2024? While there are some projects we can‚Äôt announce yet, here are a few goals we can discuss:
I also wanted to take the time to thank our team ‚Äì and especially my partner and Tread‚Äôs Co-Founder¬†Coan McAlpine¬†for believing in the vision and kicking ass in 2023. Now it‚Äôs time to double down on that mission in 2024.
Are there any products, content or offerings you would like to see us add in 2024?
Let us know by shooting an email to [email¬†protected].
We take your feedback seriously and incorporate as much of it as possible into our planning.
Here‚Äôs to reaching your potential,

Tread Amateur Pro Weekend '23 Recap,2023-06-23T21:00:00+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/tread-amateur-pro-weekend-23-recap/,"Jacob Shafer (UNC Wilmington ‚Äì PC: Matt Marsili) fires a pitch at Tread Amateur Pro Weekend ‚Äô23
At the Tread Amateur Pro Weekend 2023, more than 60 athletes displayed their talents ahead of the upcoming 2023 MLB Draft.
Every corner of college baseball was showcased at Tread HQ, with pitchers from NAIA to Division 1 and every level in between throwing over the course of the two-day-long event. Considering each of the Power Five Conferences was represented, there were plenty of impressive bullpens to go around.
Years of preparation with their Tread Performance Coaches led each of the aforementioned athletes to the bullpen mound for another step in their baseball journeys. Long hours spent designing pitches, adding velocity, and building arsenals culminated in 48 special hours in Charlotte, NC.
Day 1 (Friday)
Mario Zabala ‚Äì PC: Hunter Townsend
Within the first hour on the first day of the weekend, we witnessed our fastest bolt. 21-year-old RHP Mario Zabala, who was an outfielder (!!) during his time at FIU, lit up the radar gun.
Topping out at 98.5 MPH on the TrackMan unit (98.4 MPH Stalker), he quickly turned heads and helped set the tone for the rest of the weekend.
With a fastball averaging 97.7 MPH and a wStuff+ grade of 143, the sky‚Äôs the limit for Mario (who has yet to conclude his first year as a full-time pitcher).

Hale Sims ‚Äì PC: Lucas Still
Hale Sims is an athlete who looks like he could be wearing a helmet and shoulder pads playing on Sundays, but he belongs on the mound.
His best offering is his sweeper ‚Äì averaging 81 MPH with an impressive -13.4 inches of horizontal break. Hale delivered one of the best breaking pitches of the weekend with a 133 wStuff+ grade.
The senior out of UNC Charlotte also carries a fastball that comfortably sits at 92.5 MPH, topping out at 93.4 MPH (TrackMan).

Alex Galvan ‚Äì PC: Matt Marsili
Out of University of Louisville, Alex Galvan brought arguably the best cut-fastball seen all weekend.
With the help of his Tread PC Matt Marsili, Galvan has crafted a dangerous carry cutter. It averages 92.4 MPH,¬†8.8 inches of Induced Vertical Break (IVB), and -5.5 inches of Horizontal Break from the right side. The pitch grades out at a 141 on the Tread wStuff+ Model.
Galvan‚Äôs other offerings include a 95.1 (T96.1) MPH fastball, an 82 MPH curveball averaging -8.8 / -16.7 inches of break, and a change-up.

üî•Top Fastball & üî®Top Breaking Ball ‚Äì Austin Amaral ‚Äì PC: Chase Cunningham
(165 / 133 wStuff+)
Stetson‚Äôs own Austin Amaral flourished during his bullpen on Friday. With arguably the best fastball and breaking ball, he certainly has a case for the most impressive showing from Day 1.
Let‚Äôs begin with the fastball. For starters, a consistently mid-90s Fastball averaging 95.0 MPH is eye-popping enough. Factoring in the 21 inches of induced vertical break (IVB), Amaral‚Äôs fastball clocks in at a 165 wStuff+ rating. Additionally, his fastball topped out at 95.9 MPH.
Amaral finds himself at the top of the wStuff+ leaderboards again, this time for his big sweeper. With a healthy 83.6 MPH, 0.7 inches of IVB, and -11.8 inches of Horizontal Break, it is not surprising that the pitch grades out very highly. The 133 wStuff+ grade was again good for the best of the breaking balls thrown on the first day of the weekend.
His other offerings include a -9.7 / -9.3 in, 79.2 MPH curveball and a low 90s change-up.
Coming off of an impressive junior season in which he was named All-ASUN Second Team, Amaral is a player to keep an eye on in the upcoming weeks (and years).

üîÅ Top Off-speed ‚Äì Magdiel Cotto ‚Äì PC: Craig Stem
(132 wStuff+)
Magdiel Cotto lived up to the SEC hype this past weekend. The Kentucky arm showcased his plus change-up in front of the captive Tread audience.
The first LHP featured so far, Cotto‚Äôs change-up clocks in at exactly 86 MPH (down to the thousandths place) on average. Furthermore, 1.8 inches of IVB and 17.7 inches of arm side run amount to an impressive wStuff+ score of 132.
Adding to his change-up are a fastball that tops at 96.2 MPH, a sinker that averages 94.1 MPH with 14.5 inches of arm side movement, as well as a low-mid 80s gyro slider.
Cotto had an impressive summer in 2022, being named a Cape Cod League All Star. He is currently the #68 2023 MLB Draft college baseball prospect according to D1 Baseball, and the 102nd overall prospect according to Baseball America. Look for his name to be called early in a few weeks.

Day 1 saw ten (10!!) arms hit 95 MPH or higher at least once on Trackman.
Those 10 pitchers (and their dedicated Performance Coaches) were:
Here is a compilation of each of the pitchers listed above:
Day 2 (Saturday)
Harrison Durow  ‚Äì PC: Craig Stem
Harrison Durow fastball touched 94.1 MPH with good ride and moved explosively down the mound paired with 2 solid breaking offerings.
Durow is coming off a strong campaign at Trinity University compiling a 3.35 ERA in 48.1 innings with 64 strikeouts for the Tigers.

JD Ogden  ‚Äì PC: Devin Hayes
JD Ogden, for sure, has some deception in his delivery. Basically ducking before landing upright at foot-strike, Ogden hides the ball extremely well from the left side. His sinker and change-up have some good arm side action to pair with his gyro cutter. Oh, and he was up to 94.9 MPH.

Ryan Mitschele  ‚Äì PC: Scott Firth
The right-handed product of Cullowhee from Western Carolina, Ryan Mitschele, showed a solid four pitch mix. His best offering in his arsenal is the change-up that he throws with nearly all sidespin.

Tyler Jones  ‚Äì PC: Matt Marsili
Tyler Jones threw bullets from a side arm slot, touching 96 MPH on the day. The majority of heaters were located at the top of the zone, and his two breaking balls (a tighter shape slider and a bigger sweeper) as well as his arm-side running change-up profile well off of his fastball.

Andrew Hazell  ‚Äì PC: Justin Liserio
Andrew Hazell brought the fireworks to conclude our final bullpen of Pro Day 2023. Hazell, a current Performance Intern at Tread, sat 93.3 MPH and featured a cutter averaging 88.9 MPH, a 12-6 curveball, and a change-up with good arm-side run. With the whole facility rooting for him and music blasting, Hazell ripped his last few fastballs, topping at 93.9 MPH.

Nick Long had the highest-graded Fastball of the whole event. The high grade stems his fastball‚Äôs average velocity of 95.9 MPH and above average IVB. He reached back to register 96.9 MPH according to Trackman. It‚Äôs no surprise that he posted 10 K/9 in his last year with the University of Tampa.

Tread HQ: Pro Day '23 Recap,2023-01-25T13:37:14+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2023-pro-day-recap/,"3 days.
50+ scouts and front office staff.
100+ dream chasers.
Tread exists to provide athletes a platform to help re-write their stories, and this weekend was the best evidence of that.
This Pro Weekend, our Free Agent Pitchers had the opportunity to show off the fruits of their labor alongside their Tread Coaches and in front of personnel from 26 of 30 MLB Organizations ‚Äì and oh boy did they show up.
For the pitchers who threw, wide-ranging and unique paths brought each here: a number have hundreds of Big League innings, some many years in the Minors, and still others are looking for their first crack at the professional level.
In one way or another, each path led to Tread in the hopes of elevating their career to new heights.
For each athlete, a lifetime of hard work transpired before they ever toed the rubber this weekend. For most, fine-tuned adjustments to things like subtle movement patterns and pitch shapes occurred right down to the wire (and will continue, as each looks to constantly improve and hone their craft).
Eventually, however, it was time for each of them to let that work speak for itself as they fired away in front of 100s of eyes peeled to witness them execute their craft.
We saw velocity jumps shown off across the board, new weapons in the arsenal brandished, and the paint strokes of burgeoning Rembrandts in the form of perfectly executed pitches.
Summary: Guys threw gas, nasty breakers, and it was a hell of a time for all involved.
Let‚Äôs relive a few of the most electric bullpens on the first day here at Tread HQ.
To kick us off, we have LHP Bernardo Flores who turned scouts‚Äô heads to say the least ‚Äì including one audible ‚ÄúWho is this guy!?‚Äù from one of them.
Flores averaged 88.9 MPH on his fastball this past season in this pen he averaged 94.8 MPH and topped out at 96 MPH ‚Äì good for a 6 MPH jump!
With this wild velocity jump, we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Flores is on a big league staff this upcoming season.
Next, we have one of the most impressive arsenal overhauls in AJ Puckett who put on an absolute show.
Puckett averaged 93.5 MPH on his fastball this past season and an almost +2 MPH jump in this bullpen to an average of 95.4 MPH.
Last season, Puckett‚Äôs 4-seam fastball averaged 13 inches of induced vertical break and in his work with PC Turner Givens he‚Äôs seen that jump dramatically. The righty has also developed a sinker and wipeout sweeper in his arsenal as well in the last 6 months.
Tread‚Äôs very own Pitching Coordinator, Scott Firth, closed out Day 1 with fireworks.
Topping out at 98.1 MPH on the Stalker and nearly averaging 97 MPH on his fastball, Firth certainly impressed as well as held the record for the fastest pitch for the event.
Firth‚Äôs arsenal is the whole kitchen sink. It includes a fastball, sinker, cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup. Not only did Firth flash the hardest velocity of the event but also made Tread proud with the most diverse arsenal to make a beautiful spread on the movement chart.
Day 1 was home to seven (7) pitchers who hit at least 95 MPH on the radar gun.
Members (in order as seen in video): Jake Faria, Bernardo Flores, Curtis Taylor, Tim Naughton, AJ Puckett, Daniel Procopio, Scott Firth
üî•Top Fastball ‚Äì AJ Puckett‚Äôs 4-Seam Fastball (175 wStuff+)
The combination of above average MLB velocity and high ride on the fastball from AJ Puckett led to the best graded fastball on Day 1.
Metrics: 95.4 MPH, 19.5 in. IVB, 9.9 in. HB
üî®Top Breaking Ball ‚Äì Tim Naughton Slider (180 wStuff+)
To no surprise the best graded breaking ball from the first day goes to a big sweeper thrown at 84 MPH out of the hand of Tim Naughton. With assistance from PC Matt Marsili, Naughton has added significant sweep to his slider that has been up 87.1 MPH in house during live ABs.
Metrics: 83.8 MPH, 1.7 in. IVB, -17 in. HB
üîÅ Top Offspeed ‚Äì Tommy Eveld Changeup (140 wStuff+)
Best graded changeup is awarded to Tommy Eveld who is a former quarterback at USF. Eveld really ‚Äúchanged up‚Äù his path (sorry, bad pun) by trying his hand at this whole pitching thing in college after not playing baseball in high school.
Eveld really kills the vertical break on his changeup while producing 6 extra inches of armside movement as compared to his fastball.
Metrics: 88.1 MPH, 1.4 in. IVB, 12.4 in. HB
The second day of the event kicked off Saturday morning at 10 AM energized by Dunkin‚Äô coffee and fuzz balls.
Jake Stevenson arguably had the most electric bullpen of Day 2.
He lit up the radar gun to the tune of a 95.9 MPH average heater while showing off his flashy four pitch mix which includes a cut-ride fastball, a legit changeup, a firm sweeper at 85 MPH, and a 90 MPH slutter.
Zach Mort was an absolute artist on Saturday.
Not only did Mort display a four pitch mix with a carry fastball at 95 MPH, hard cutter at 89 MPH, power curve at 83 MPH, and splitter at 88 MPH ‚Äì he also dotted up around the zone.
Very Bob Ross-esque. üé®
Even before stepping on the mound, Al Pesto‚Äôs name alone caught people‚Äôs attention.
And when he stepped on the mound, his demeanor and fuel gave reason for it.
Pesto closed out the Day 2 with incredible energy at he pumped 96+ MPH along with a solid hard gyro slider up to 89 MPH.
Day 2 hosted another eight (8) pitchers who hit at least 95 MPH.
Members (in order as seen in video): Adrian De Horta, Nathan Alexander, Patrick Baker, Brac Warren, Jake Stevenson, Cory Wilder, Zach Mort, Al Pesto
üî•Top Fastball ‚Äì Zach Mort‚Äôs 4-Seam Fastball (174 wStuff+)
Zach Mort averaged nearly 95 MPH on his fastball with elite carry which led him to have the highest graded fastball on Day 2.
Metrics: 94.8 MPH, 19.7 in. IVB, 9.2 in. HB
üî®Top Breaking Ball ‚Äì Cory Wilder‚Äôs Slider (157 wStuff+)
Another sweeper takes home the prize for the best graded breaking ball of the day in Cory Wilder‚Äôs big slider up 83 MPH.
Metrics: 82.5 MPH, 2.9 in. IVB, -20 in. HB
üîÅ Top Offspeed ‚Äì Dan Goggin Changeup (159 wStuff+)
Dan Goggin, previously up to AA, showed off his newly altered slot for MLB organizations on Day 2 which helped him in producing the best graded changeup of the day hovering around the horizontal line with crazy arm side movement.
Metrics: 81.4 MPH, -1.3 in. IVB, 16.9 in. HB
Day 2 and Day 3 have a couple extra fun sections to add to this Pro Weekend recap‚Ä¶
While many of us were still drinking our Saturday morning coffee around 10 AM, Adrian De Horta ended his bullpen with an easy, casual 95 MPH bullet to really wake everyone up.
Nathan Alexander ‚Äì Knuckleball
If throwing 96 MPH did not catch the eyes of scouts enough, Nathan Alexander really cemented himself in the minds of spectators when he broke out his knuckleball that danced through the air.
Cory Wilder ‚Äì Cutter
Not many ‚Äúwilder‚Äù (sorry, last bad pun ‚Äì I think) things happened on Day 2 than Cory Wilder‚Äôs cutter. In touching 90 MPH with 11 inches of induced vertical break and -7 inches of horizontal break, Wilder was essentially throwing a left handed fastball.
We had double barrel action on Day 3 and some of the best pure stuff was flashed on the final day of this event.
With Saathoff‚Äôs bullpen starting at 9:10 AM, watching a dude top 97.5 MPH on the TrackMan and average over 95 MPH was probably not on most spectators‚Äô bingo cards. Allan did just that.
Saathoff showed off a carry fastball with a sweeper that averaged 86 MPH and has good feel for it as well as a changeup that he flashed.
Did we mention he kicked off the week by dragging a 250+ pound dead buck 50-yards from his backyard to the street for pick-up? Kid is just built different.
Nic Luc displayed his diverse arsenal to impress many throughout the facility. The glove popped and heads turned as he averaged nearly 95 MPH on his heater, showing off his cutter, slider, curveball, changeup too all the while executing those weapons well.
Honestly, just take a look for yourself.
Six straight 95+ MPH pitches in/around the zone will certainly grab the attention of anyone and Daniel Blair did exactly that. A 95 MPH heater paired with a 85 MPH sweeper, a cutter, and a changeup with 14 more inches of arm side run to it as compared to the fastball? Yeah, that‚Äôll get the job done.
Maybe saving some of the best for last?
Alan Carter‚Äôs bullpen created BUZZ around Tread HQ.
With his fastball that crossed the horizontal line pretty consistently both in movement AND release, the cut-ride combo at 95+ MPH was incredible to witness. This paired with his splitter that drops and moves like nobody‚Äôs business and the curveball that he flashed, there will be plenty of teams lining up for Carter‚Äôs services.
Double digit (10) arms hit 95+ MPH on the TrackMan to close out the event on Sunday.
Members (in order as seen in video): Karl Blum, Nic Luc, Allan Saathoff, DJ Wilkinson, Alan Carter, Jan Figueroa, Anthony Boix, Daniel Blair, JC Coronado, John Murphy
üî•Top Fastball ‚Äì Alan Carter‚Äôs 4-Seam Fastball (192 wStuff+)
Alan Carter averaged nearly 96 MPH on his fastball with getting up to 20 inches of induced vertical break and up to nearly -4 inches of horizontal break. Carter‚Äôs fastball on Day 3 was the highest graded fastball across the entire event.
Metrics: 95.7 MPH, 18.7 in. IVB, -1.5 in. HB
üî®Top Breaking Ball ‚Äì DJ Wilkinson‚Äôs Slider (139 wStuff+)
Surprise surprise ‚Äì yet another sweeper. DJ Wilkinson averaged nearly 84 MPH and 14 inches of sweep on his slider and he found himself atop the breaking ball leaderboard on the final day of the weekend.
Metrics: 83.9 MPH, 1.6 in. IVB, -14 in. HB
üîÅ Top Offspeed ‚Äì Daniel Blair Changeup (210 wStuff+)
Daniel Blair‚Äôs changeup had 6 inches less vertical break, 14 inches more horizontal break off of his cut-ride fastball, and 11 MPH of differential from the fastball. Guess that‚Äôll play. Oh, and it‚Äôs super satisfying to watch.
Metrics: 84.2 MPH, 14.6 in. IVB, 19.8 in. HB
First bullpen. 9 AM. 2 pitches in. 95 MPH. That‚Äôs all it took for Karl Blum to toe the rubber and throw ‚õΩÔ∏è.
Michael Spinozzi ‚Äì Cut Changeup
Michael Spinozzi throws quite the outlier pitch here. The cut-changeup? Movement profile of a slider (kinda?) with the grip of a changeup? Whatever it is, it‚Äôs a unicorn pitch and it‚Äôs fun.
Alan Carter ‚Äì Fastball
We already covered Alan Carter‚Äòs outlier cut-ride fastball earlier, but at a 192 wStuff+ and a movement profile similar to that of Pete Fairbanks ‚Äì it was too hard to leave out here.
This year‚Äôs event was outstanding and the best to date here at Tread HQ.
The overwhelming gratitude for being part of a such a momentous occasion in each of these athletes‚Äô experiences echoed through the weekend and has spilled over to the week that follows.
But if Tread‚Äôs history has shown us anything, the best is certainly yet to come for all involved.

Year in Review 2022: Tread Athletics,2022-12-29T23:06:41+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2022-year-in-review/,"I‚Äôm not going to lie, writing these end of year blog posts is starting to make me feel like DJ Khaled.
While we don‚Äôt update our blog too often (99% of our content is posted on our social media platforms), I still feel compelled to share how this year went with you all.
In short: it was nuts.
But first, let me rewind.
Last year¬†we added 20 new members to the Tread team, had 11 draftees and 10 free agent signs, began to build out a true content department and opened Tread 2.0. We also committed to¬†telling more of our athlete‚Äôs stories in 2022¬†on top of massively scaling up the capacity of our in-person training operation in Charlotte, NC.
While we accomplished all of this, it was just the tip of the iceberg.
So what happened in 2022 and where are we headed for 2023? Let‚Äôs take a look.
Of these, 9 were performance coaches, and included¬†Emilio Martinez,¬†Alex Kachler,¬†Paul Hall,¬†Alex Goetz,¬†Sam Eades,¬†Kyle Wellman,¬†Mark Fischer,¬†Craig Stem¬†and¬†Eric Mock.
We also added 10 support staff, including:
Each of these individuals beat out numerous other candidates and have extremely bright futures at Tread.
We celebrate our people at Tread, which is why we go through the effort to put them¬†on display¬†and encourage them to share their knowledge on our social media channels.
Certain pro orgs continue to unsuccessfully try to poach our people, while more savvy orgs have figured out that strategically partnering with us provides exponentially more value to their players and organization.
The reason we have been able to retain talent to this point is simple:¬†we prioritize treating our people right.
In 2022 this meant raising the¬†starting salary¬†for every coach at Tread by over 20%, outlining multi-year growth trajectories and including full benefits for every employee to take advantage of.
The flip side to these steps was making sure that every employee at Tread was either on or off the bus ‚Äì which led to tough personnel decisions that have ultimately made our team that much closer and more unified in our mission of¬†helping athletes re-write their stories.
How do we attempt to orient ourselves on a daily basis to make this happen? By being clear about what we stand for:
This is the filter that every potential hire is passed through, and this is a big part of how we evaluate our team.
If you can align a group of people around a shared mission, with shared values, a very special culture begins to emerge.
Speaking of which, look how big the #squad is getting.
With a number of¬†positions¬†still looking to be filled for 2023, we‚Äôre excited about what the future holds for Tread.
We firmly believe that¬†the team we‚Äôve assembled rivals anyone else in baseball, and look forward to the impact we can make over the coming years across thousands of high school, college and pro players.
9 of our remote athletes were drafted and another 38 signed free agent deals in 2022. That‚Äôs pretty freaking cool. (See our¬†full list of signs & draft picks¬†here).
We also had several of our pros debut this year, including Zack Thompson (STL), Bubby Rossman (PHI), Cody Sedlock (BAL) and Alex Faedo (DET). Here‚Äôs a look at the remote athletes who were drafted this year:
Here‚Äôs a feature video we produced on 8th rounder Dylan Tebrake. I‚Äôll let the video do the talking:

Are Rotational Medicine Ball Throws The Key To Pitching Velocity?,2022-08-12T13:22:04+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/rmbt/,"The term key performance indicators, or KPI‚Äôs, in the sports performance world can be defined as exercises or athletic tests that have a correlation to on field performance.
For example, a sprinter‚Äôs broad jump is a good KPI for their ability to accelerate over the first 15 meters in the 100-meter dash. On the other hand, the results of a VO2 max for these same athletes would not be considered a KPI.
The reason we like KPI‚Äôs is that we can train them in the weight room knowing that the time and effort we put into these exercises will pay dividends.
Personally, I‚Äôve studied this subject for a long time as it relates to throwing a baseball and recently, I was made aware of a study that highlighted a particular KPI that was correlated to throwing velocity.
The title really grabbed my attention. Not only does this KPI, the rotational medicine ball throw, correlate to throwing velocity but it also predicts bat speed and exit velocity. Obviously, we are going to focus on the throwing side of things here but this looks like something that we should be seeing in baseball weight rooms all across the country.
These researchers from Spalding University in Kentucky ran an entire college baseball team through a physical assessment using three tests to see how they relate to these important on-field metrics that we see in the title of the paper.
Here are the three athletic tests
The reason they picked these specific tests is that each one represents one of the three planes of movement that the body can produce.
They found, which should be obvious from the title, that it was in fact the rotational med ball throw for velocity (RMBTV) that best predicted all three of these valuable on-field metrics.
Here‚Äôs how they performed this movement since there are countless ways to throw a medicine ball.
This motion looks more like hitting than it does pitching. They described this motion in the transverse plane as ‚Äúlong axis rotation through the hip and trunk‚Äù which is something that happens when we hit and pitch.
So even though the arms are kept straight throughout the movement there is enough specificity to pitching due to the ‚Äúlong axis rotation‚Äù in the transverse plane to cause this correlation between the two.
Pitchers were able to throw a 6 lb med ball with a 12.5‚Äù diameter about 25 mph. The researchers stated that ‚Äúa moderately high correlation was also observed between pitching velocity and RMBTV (r = 0.62, p = 0.02), explaining 38% of the variance between those two variables‚Äù.
In second place was the lateral-to-medial jump which represented the frontal plane. It is still specific to throwing since they both display some side-to-side movement that defines the frontal plane action.
In this case, the jump distance in this direction wasn‚Äôt enough for it to be to consider significantly correlated to throwing velocity.
The lateral-to-medial jump is near and dear to me since it was the star of my research article published in this same journal almost a decade ago. The fact that it didn‚Äôt significantly correlate to throwing velocity honestly was a hit to my academic ego and my bias.
This made me dig into the details of the study to see if there were any differences that could explain this variance.
The biggest distinction between the two studies was that I had my guys throw without a mound. Without the aid of a sloped mound and the gravity that comes with it I can see how having more power in the frontal plane could be more beneficial when it comes to flat ground throwing.
Other than that, the group of subjects were fairly similar to one another in regards to height (6‚Äô1‚Äù in this study vs 6‚Äô0‚Äù in my study), weight (192lbs vs 182lbs), lateral-to-medial jump (6‚Äô2‚Äù vs 6‚Äô3) performance and throwing velocity (82mph vs 80mph).
But if we were to take into account the inflation rate of throwing velocity from 2012 to today, I think my subjects were harder throwers relatively back when throwing 90 mph meant something.
The broad jump came in last place and was representing the sagittal plane. The vast majority of athletic tests are sagittal plane movements like sprinting and vertical jumping.
These tests are great to look at overall athletic ability but they just don‚Äôt have as strong of a carry over to throwing velocity. My study showed similarly low levels of correlation of throwing velocity to tests like the 60-yard dash, pro-agility, vertical jump and a couple of other sagittal plane-based tests.
What‚Äôs interesting is that these researchers not only reported the raw distance each athlete could jump, both broad and lateral-to-medial, but they also standardized these distances based on the athletes‚Äô size.
For the broad jump, the distance was divided by their height while the lateral-to-medial jump was standardized to mean leg length. So, if a shorter athlete jumped just as far as a taller athlete, they would have a higher standardized jump score.
However, neither the raw or standardized jump scores for either the broad or lateral-to-medial jumps correlate to throwing velocity.
I thought it was great how they looked at jump performance but I wish they could have also calculated some version of power by taking the individual weight of each player into consideration.
Body weight is almost always mentioned as one of the top factors that contribute to velocity in these types of studies.
The more mass you have behind you the more potential you have to create higher levels of momentum that you can transfer to the ball. The best way to create lots of momentum is to have a lot of mass and move it quickly.
Transferring as much of that momentum as possible to a ball is a bit trickier and requires some in-depth bio-mechanics.
Since body weight wasn‚Äôt factored into the jumps it‚Äôs hard to say that they aren‚Äôt as useful as the RMBVT to predict throwing velocity.
The reason I say this is because the RMBVT is a test where extra body weight can be a competitive advantage. The RMBVT wasn‚Äôt standardized by weight giving lighter athlete‚Äôs a 4 lbs ball and heavier players an 8 lbs med ball.
The fact that it wasn‚Äôt standardized is probably a big reason it correlated to throwing velocity coupled with the transverse plane specificity. No matter how you throw a medicine ball the result is based purely on how much energy and momentum you transfer to the ball no matter how big or small you are.
In my study the test finished in second place right behind the lateral-to-medial jump in regards to predicting throwing velocity was med ball throw in the sagittal plane. The test required the athletes to throw a 6 lbs med ball backwards as far as possible. We called it a scoop toss.
The arms are required to be straight just like the RMBVT and after a couple of practice throws most athletes were able to figure out their optimal launch angle to maximize distance. What‚Äôs funny is that if we just look at the lower half when we perform a broad jump and a scoop toss the actions are fairly similar.
But in one case they don‚Äôt help predict throwing and in the other they do which shows how we have to dig a little deeper.
So, this sagittal plane test that looks nothing like throwing a baseball can also be helpful in determining if an athlete has the type of power needed to light up a radar gun. Maybe the specificity we need to be talking about is the act of throwing.
These throws are similar enough in the sense that they are full body movements that rely heavily on acceleration and the transfer of momentum from your body to whatever you‚Äôre trying to throw. This sequential acceleration from a dead start through to release is vital for throwing success in any arena.
What I‚Äôm getting at is throws of all types would be great to implement with your players on-field.
1 ‚Äì They have been shown to relate to on-field performance: see above.2 ‚Äì They can provide feedback in the form of distance and/or velocity: this will help create more intent.3 ‚Äì They are fun & competitive: easy way to compete with fellow teammates.4 ‚Äì They don‚Äôt have an eccentric portion: as a result, they cause little to no muscular soreness the next day which makes them great for in-season training.5 ‚Äì They aren‚Äôt too complex: good enough technique for med ball throws should be easy to achieve after a couple of sessions with feedback like velocity and/or distance. So, once you‚Äôve hit a ceiling of technique any further improvements are a result increased muscular power.6- They can be used as a form of athlete monitoring: because of this low-technique the results of regular med ball throws under the same conditions can tell you if a player is fatigued from a neuromuscular standpoint if there‚Äôs a significant drop in performance.
It‚Äôs obvious that I like med ball throws and I think they should be in every baseball player training regime all year round with a variety of different types of throws. With that being said I think that training and testing the jumps in this study are still important.
If for example, you have an athlete that can‚Äôt broad jump their height you might want to spend some time and energy improving this aspect of athleticism. Odds are that an increase in broad jump performance going from less than 1.0x times standing height towards 1.25 and eventually 1.5 times height would produce an increase in throwing velocity.
Beyond this the broad jump will then, in my opinion, start to display some diminishing rate of return. If, however, an athlete could increase their body mass and still jump 1.5 x their height we could see some positive gains on the mound.
For the record the broad jump scores in this study were on average 7‚Äô11‚Äù with the height of 6‚Äô1‚Äù which gives us a score of 1.3 times height.
I think that it‚Äôs awesome that these researchers found that one single test can be correlated to throwing velocity, bat speed and exit velocity.¬†However, no one test is going to give us all the information that we need to help steer athletes in the right direction in regards to their training.¬†A series of tests and assessments should be implemented to see which areas of physical development are lagging behind to see where there is the greatest room for improvement.

Is PAP A Velo Hack?,2022-03-03T17:14:59+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/pap/,"Have you ever wanted to throw a baseball just a little harder? Even if it‚Äôs just for one throw to prove to yourself that have more velocity in the tank? If you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm sure that the answer is yes.
This article is going to highlight some research where the participants in the study demonstrated an increase throwing performance by about 3% just by doing a couple of vertical jumps a minute before they threw.
An acute increase of 3% would mean that your 85mph fastball could bump up to 87.5mph or if you can throw 90 mph, you‚Äôd be touching 92.7 mph. Both of these increases would be great. If you‚Äôre wondering if it works then keep reading.
Here is the study: Acute Effect of Countermovement Jumping on Throwing Performance in Track and Field Athletes During Competition. G.P. Karampatsos & G. D Terzis (2017)
These researchers were looking into how to leverage something call Post Activation Potentiation (PAP) into real results in a real competition for these track and field athletes.
With the proper implementation, PAP can serve as a momentary ‚Äúpower boost‚Äù allowing your muscles to crank out more force following what they call a ‚Äúconditioning activity‚Äù which in this case were the 3 vertical jumps.
Most of the research around PAP has used squat racks so that athletes can perform a conditioning activity like a squat with a high percentage of their 1RM or an isometric quarter squat against an immovable load for 5 to 10 seconds.
Both of these conditioning activities can excite/prime/potentiate your muscles without causing too much fatigue. If athletes instead performed a set of 20 squats or executed a 1-minute isometric hold the potentiating effects would be masked by the fatigue that these activities resulting in a decrease in performance.
While having a squat rack, barbell and lots of weights can help induce an acute increase in power these tools aren‚Äôt commonly found in too many, if any, bullpens around the world.
The same holds true for tracks that host meets. For this reason, these authors set out to see if something more practical like countermovement jumps could produce similar results.
Jumping as high as you can will also recruit a high number of motor units and muscle fibers.
This is a key element to any successful conditioning activity. However, performing too many jumps like a P90X workout would be too much and bring fatigue to the table and impede any positive outcome.
We won‚Äôt go into the deep details around the human physiology of why PAP occurs. If you are interested, check out this nerdy literature review, I did years ago.
The design was simple and elegant plus it was used in a real live track meet which is something that you don‚Äôt see very often.
One minute prior to their 2nd, 4th and 6th throwing attempts the athletes performed 3 max effort countermovement jumps.
Before their 1st, 3rd and 5th attempts they did not perform any type of conditioning activity other than what they would normally which in most cases was sit and walking around while waiting for their turn, around 8-10 minutes.
Their results demonstrated an overall increase of 3% in the attempts that were preceded with the jumps.
They looked back to previous competitions to see if there was always a performance increase in the 2nd, 4th and 6th attempts but that was not the case.
So, it was this simple yet effective technique of potentiating the muscles of the lower body with three countermovement jumps that caused this increase across the board with these 4 different types of throws.
These authors even performed a pilot project where they got shot putters to try this technique prior to the only their 4th attempt at a national level competition and saw about a 2% increase.
It is hard to argue with these results but before we get too excited about our 3% velo bump we have to take into consideration certain differences between track and field throwing and pitching.
The biggest and most obvious difference is the weight of the object being thrown.
For the men in this study the shot put and hammer are 16lbs which is 50 times heavier than a baseball. These are considered the ‚Äúheavy throws‚Äù in the track and field world.
The ‚Äúlight throws‚Äù are the discus and javelin which weigh 4 pounds and 800 grams respectively. So even though they are ‚Äúlight‚Äù these two implements are still 12.8 and 5.6 times heavier than a baseball.
The good news from this study in regards to the weight of the objects being thrown is that there were more improvements with the ‚Äúlight‚Äù throws compared to the ‚Äúheavier.‚Äù
The shot putters and hammer throwers saw an increase of about 1.6% whereas the discus and javelin athletes exhibited a 4.6% enhancement. That 4.6% would now take that 85mph fastball and crank it up to 88.9mph.
The concept of accuracy is also very different between the two sports. In track you just need to have your throw land in between the lines that are at a 29-degree angle for javelin and 35 degrees for the other 3 throws.
I mention this because a sudden increase in power from your lower half might also have an effect on exactly where that ball crosses the plate even if it is moving 3% faster.
Another key difference between the two sports that I want to highlight is that track and field athletes make much fewer throws with a lot more rest between throws than a pitcher on a mound.
They make 6 throws with 8-10 minutes between throws. Nothing like pitching in a real game. So even if we copied what they did in this study we might not see that 3-4.6% increase with every throw throughout an entire inning let alone multiple innings due to fatigue setting in.
But maybe you want to hit a PR with a pulldown (aka javelin throw) or maybe you‚Äôre at a tryout where you need to show scouts and coaches that you can touch 90, 91, 92, 93‚Ä¶
No, I am not talking about the launch angle that we hear hitting coaches talk about but rather the angle that the object is being thrown.
The name of the game in track and field is distance and because of this there is a significant amount of vertical force that needs to be applied into the ground to produce the optimal trajectory to allow for max distance.
Optimal trajectory is thought to be about a 42-degree launch angle. In contrast, pitchers are throwing off a mound and produce a slight downward angle.
What I‚Äôm getting at is that pitchers might not see the same kind of results from a vertical jump due to the specificity of the force vectors at play.
My research study back in 2013 demonstrated that vertical jump performance isn‚Äôt as good of a predictor of baseball throwing velocity as the lateral jump due to this concept of specificity.
So maybe performing a couple of lateral-to-medial jumps will help improve pitching performance a little bit more by emphasizing both the frontal plane and a horizontal force vector.
Sounds like a research study for any of you academics out there.
In fact, my original idea for my master‚Äôs thesis was to see if an isometric contraction in the frontal plane would have an acute effect on throwing velocity.
This is why I have a literature review of PAP on my site. I didn‚Äôt want all that time and effort go to waste so I decided to put it on my web site to add content.
While I am glad that I changed my mind I do think that performing either a couple of lateral jumps or a short isometric contraction in the frontal plane before entering a game or between innings when your teammates are scoring you some runs could have some benefit when it comes to velocity.
Finding what works for you might take some trial and error.
PAP is a very personal thing. What might potentiate the muscles of one player might be too much for another and cause fatigue.
In fact, here‚Äôs an older article looking at a study that focused on the most popular form of PAP in the game of baseball, the weighted donut in the on-deck circle.
The quick recap is that the donut actually caused a decrease in swing speed. The authors attributed this decrease to the idea that their subjects were not big and strong enough to handle the added weight.
What did work however were a couple of isometric holds at critical points of the swing.
Hopefully this information can be used to help unlock some velocity. Sometimes athletes just need to see what is possible even if it‚Äôs just one throw.
Graeme
Editors Note: We have also come up with a quick PAP routine for our remote athletes, shared below. On top of playing with jump variations, priming the upper body and trunk accelerators (pecs, lats and obliques) may yield some benefit as well. Not every athlete seems to need or respond to this routine, while anecdotally others see a 1-2 mph bump on days that they aren‚Äôt otherwise feeling ‚Äúprimed‚Äù and ‚Äúfresh.‚Äù
Post-Activation Potentiation (PAP), the short-term improvement in performance following a ""priming"" exercise/routine, is a topic that we have been toying with.There are many variables at play, but we've seen this routine bump certain guys +1-3 mph done 5-10 min pre-throwing. pic.twitter.com/OxFLGvIDHJ

2021 Year in Review,2021-12-31T23:05:22+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2021-year-in-review/,"Wow. What a year.
While a ton happened, I‚Äôm going to take the time here to highlight some of the most noteworthy milestones and accomplishments of 2021.
Last year we added 11 new members to the Tread staff, cranked out tons of content, started a newsletter, and added 9 MLB players to our remote training roster. Not a shabby year.
At the end of that post I wrote that our main goal for 2021 was to launch an in-house training offering in addition to the remote training service, continue growing the Tread team, launch an internship, continue cranking out a large amount of content and partner with more colleges & organizations.
While we accomplished all of these goals, this was just the tip of the iceberg.
So what happened in 2021, and what does 2022 have in store for Tread? Here‚Äôs an overview.
If you couldn‚Äôt tell from looking at our team page or the constant hiring posts on social media, we‚Äôve been adding members to our team at a rapid pace.
It‚Äôs a fun environment when virtually every month we have one or two new members joining the team here in Charlotte, NC.
There‚Äôs excitement towards the collective mission of Tread, and many of these new faces have stepped up to the plate in a big way for us in 2021.
As we reiterate to our team, our company mission is simple: Tread exists to help athletes re-write their stories.
Simplifying and articulating this mission has allowed us to more clearly connect with talent from around the country, establish if there are shared values and help show them the path to a long term career at Tread.
‚ÄúTread exists to help athletes re-write their stories.‚Äú
By the way, we‚Äôre still looking for a Content Specialist, Baseball Operations Assistant, Business Associate and Performance Coach, so check those out if you‚Äôre interested in applying.
Performance Staff
We added 12 performance coaches to our staff, including Turner Givens, Matt Marsili, Cory Wilder, Zach Mort, Hunter Townsend, Jason Foster, Tanner Pruett, Ryan Kirk, Chase Cunningham, Scott Firth, Lucas Still and Austin Roark.
Check out their bios, as they all have some unique stories and bring a wide range of expertise and personalities to Tread‚Äôs athlete experience.
We also hired Nancy Newell as our Director of Performance, and I can‚Äôt say enough about the impact she‚Äôs had from the very start. Most notably, she coordinated the official launch of Tread U, an internal education platform that we designed in order to quickly educate & train up new hires on all things performance.
If you could major in ‚ÄúPitching Development‚Äù in college, you would have taken that major. So would I.
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre building with Tread U ‚Äì dozens of courses and hundreds of modules to give our coaches an environment in which to learn and develop at an incredibly rapid rate. Nancy has been instrumental in spearheading this one-of-a-kind initiative.
Support Staff
Jake McSteen joined Tread as our Internal Operations Manager, former MLB pitcher Kyle Crockett was hired as a Business Associate, former remote athletes Michael Voveris and Chris Apecechea came on as Athlete Representatives, and Jamie Johnson joined us in facility operations.
Content Team
Apurba Apu joined us last January as a Content Specialist and has become one of the key individuals that allows such a high volume of content to make its way to our social media platforms on a weekly basis.
With a number of positions still looking to be filled for 2022, we‚Äôre excited about what the future holds for Tread.
We firmly believe that the team we‚Äôve assembled rivals anyone else in baseball, and look forward to the impact we can make over the coming years across thousands of high school, college and pro players.
11 of our remote athletes were drafted and another 10 signed free agent deals in 2021. That‚Äôs pretty freaking cool. (See our full list of signs & draft picks here).
All of this in a shortened 20-round MLB draft.
We also had several of our pros debut this year, including Will Vest, Paul Campbell, Brent Honeywell and Joe Ryan. Here‚Äôs a look at the remote athletes who were drafted this year:
While first rounder and remote athlete Maddux Bruns was a noteworthy pick, how about this story on Rohan Handa, who I mentioned in last year‚Äôs write-up?
He essentially took a gap year due to the pandemic, opted out of the 2021 season and was still drafted in the 5th round after impressing in the NECBL this summer throwing 97 mph. Something tells me this approach is only going to become more common.
Pre-pandemic: @rohan__handa was mid 80'sJuly 2021: 94-97+ & drafted by the @SFGiants in the 5th round.ü§Øüî•Get to know the man behind the stache: pic.twitter.com/W6AjvCjGC0
Even Peter Gammons had something to say about this one:
My favorite draft/scouting storyline for the draft is LHP Rohan Handa. Born in India, Handa was  nicw high 80's lefty at Yale. Pandemic hit, 2020. Went home to Charlotte, worked on delivery, now throwing 97 w/scouts call a 60 slider for the Mystic Schooners of NECBL.
Or what about remote athlete Clay Holmes, who had historically struggled through 2020 with the Pirates. He started working with us in the fall of 2020. His average sinker velocity went from 92.4 in 2020 to 96.1 in 2021 (and he sat 97-98 all postseason). He also had one of the highest ground ball rates in the MLB and was one of the best relievers in baseball since being traded to the Yankees in the second half.
Talk about nasty!

This list is just the tip of the iceberg, so make sure to follow our social media accounts for regular updates of many more athletes.
While hundreds of high school, college and pro players respectively began training remotely with Tread this year, there was a strong push from pros at the highest level ‚Äì with more than two dozen current and former MLB pitchers joining us this fall.
Given how complex many of their issues are (with many of these guys having long injury histories, compensations, altered mechanics and more), this provides an opportunity to solve some of the most challenging cases out there.
We strive for our team to be the ‚Äúproblem-solvers‚Äù of the industry, and we‚Äôre excited to continue refining our training methods and putting them to the test at the highest levels of baseball.

We cranked out 45 new YouTube videos in 2021, many of them 20-40 minutes long. When we do a topic, we like to go deep, but at the same time we have gotten feedback that shorter videos are more digestible by our viewers. We‚Äôll be mixing in some shorter videos in 2022 for those of you with ADHD  as there seems to be a desire for this.
Speaking of content, here are some of the most viewed posts and videos from 2021:

This fall we officially added a data package to our offering.
This is primarily geared towards our pro athletes (as they have significantly more data available for analysis), but has also been extended to high school and college pitchers who have access to Trackman / Rapsodo data.
Pitchers now get a 25+ page data report with this package, but most importantly, we‚Äôre able to devote the time to regularly breaking down and problem solving everything from pitch usage and outcomes to movement profiles and pitch design, to pitch grades, comps and more.
Here‚Äôs an example of how powerful this data can be:
We determined that one of our pros had been using his best pitch (his curveball) less than 12% of the time!
We identified this when he came to us mid-season and with a simple tweak to his pitch usage, an adjustment to his approach, and a subtle mechanical tweak, he finished the year with an MLB post-season call-up.
He actually added several mph to his curveball and began generating strikeouts again even as his walk % decreased.
A few screenshots from the initial data report:
What, you thought I wasn‚Äôt going to save the biggest news for last?
After more than a year and a half of coordinating, and a very cramped and overflowing Tread 1.0, we finally opened new and improved Tread 2.0 this December.
A few shots we took last week (click to enlarge):
This private training facility in Charlotte, NC is 33,000 square feet and contains everything our athletes could need from a development standpoint.
The space is far from complete, but it‚Äôs already an electric atmosphere in here with high school, college, pro and MLB pitchers training side-by-side.
Here‚Äôs a glimpse at Padres‚Äô prospect Jason Reynolds training at Tread 2.0:

While the space is exclusive to remote athletes at this time, feel free to reach out to express your interest in joining our athlete community.
What do we have in store for 2022? While there are some key partnerships, exciting projects and pending hires that we can‚Äôt announce yet, here are a few goals we can discuss:
I also wanted to take the time to thank our team ‚Äì and especially my partner and Co-founder Coan McAlpine for believing in the vision and kicking ass in 2021. Now it‚Äôs time to double down on that mission in 2022.
Are there any products, content or offerings you would like to see us add in 2022?
Let us know by shooting an email to [email¬†protected].
We take your feedback seriously and incorporate as much of it as possible into our planning.
Here‚Äôs to reaching your potential,

"""Using Your Legs"" | Ground Reaction Forces and Energy Flow",2021-09-10T15:09:09+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/energy-flow/,"The Little League World Series (LLWS) is once again upon us. I love watching these yo¬≠¬≠ung athletes play this game in its purest form.
The coaches in this year‚Äôs LLWS are mic‚Äôd up to give us some more insight into the game.¬† We don‚Äôt hear them all the time but if we did, I‚Äôd bet we would hear this phrase a couple of times from the dugout directed to the pitcher:
‚ÄúUse your legs!!!‚Äù
Everyone knows that you have to use your legs to effectively throw a baseball. If you want to keep your elbow and shoulder as healthy as possible, you need to use your legs.
If you want to throw as hard as possible, you definitely need to use your legs.
While everyone knows they need to use their legs, not everyone knows HOW to use their legs. The problem is that many coaches themselves don‚Äôt really know the exact answer either.
One reason is because not much is really known about the lower half as compared to the upper body in the research world.
Even the question of ‚Äúhow do I use my legs?‚Äù is pretty vague and broad. We really need to break it down into more precise questions like:
These questions are really hard to answer since we don‚Äôt receive objective and quantifiable information about our legs and how they interact with the ground when we throw a baseball.
Very few of us are working with mounds equipped with force plates to give us the answers to these kinds of questions. So, we have to rely on information from those that do and pass on what they have learned.
Today I wanted to share my breakdown of a study that I came across from a couple of Universities (Marquette and Saint Louis) that I think provides some answers to the questions I mentioned above and thus needs to reach as many baseball players and coaches as possible. The best part is that they used Little Leaguers (age 11-13) as their subjects.
Peak horizontal ground reaction forces and impulse correlate with segmental energy flow in youth baseball pitchers
The title of this study is not going to jump out to most people due to the jargon. The terms like impulse, energy flow and ground reaction forces aren‚Äôt that common in baseball circles so let‚Äôs start by quickly defining them.
Ground Reaction Force (GRF) is a measurement of how much force you put into the ground.
The easiest way to experience GRF is to go stand on a weight scale, preferably an older style with the dial.
Once you‚Äôre on the scale press down with your feet as if you are about to jump ‚Äì you should see the dial quickly go past your body weight.
This happens because you‚Äôre putting more force into the ground.
Those people who can jump high are really good at putting a lot of force into the ground,¬†and since the ground isn‚Äôt going anywhere it forces your body up off the ground.
This is the ‚Äúreaction‚Äù part of the name.
Obviously, these Universities aren‚Äôt just getting pitchers to stand on bathroom scales while they pitch.
They use expensive Force plates which are essentially really fancy weight scales that can tell you how much you are applying, when you are applying it and in which direction.
Peak GRF is the most common piece of information that we traditionally get from studies. This lets us know what was the highest amount of force that was produced during a movement.
If we were to look at the vertical jump again, we see that we aren‚Äôt producing the same amount of force throughout the entire action. There is a build-up of power. To find the peak, we simply look for the highest point.
Impulse GRF is another type of measurement that we get from force plates, looking at how much force was applied over a specific time period.
Force plates can provide us with this kind of information since they are taking snapshots of how much force is being applied every millisecond.
Energy Flow is a term that I wasn‚Äôt familiar with until recently, but I‚Äôve been seeing it more as an outcome measure. What I mean by this is that studies are using Energy Flow like they would velocity in other throwing studies. So, studies would look to see if something increased or decreased Energy Flow.
Based on the definition below, Energy Flow is a good thing so we want to find things that improve it.
‚ÄúEnergy flow (EF) analysis is a method that allows researchers to quantify the transfer of mechanical energy between body segments, and thus provides some insight into the mechanics and efficiency of the body‚Äôs ‚Äò‚Äòkinetic chain‚Äù‚Äú
How they calculate energy flow is fairly complicated and is worthy of its own article.
For now, just know that they use some intricate math to create an equation using measures like segmental angular velocity, joint force power, linear joint velocity, and joint moment to come up with the final Energy Flow outcome.
In this study, Energy Flow was measured at the pelvis, trunk, and throwing arm. In previous studies, Energy Flow at the shoulder joint had the highest correlation to throwing velocity.
Now that this is out of the way, let‚Äôs dig into the study.
The question that these researchers wanted to answer is to see which type of GRF, peak or impulse, was a better predictor of Energy Flow.
The quick answer is impulse.
We just learned that Impulse is how much force is applied over a specific period of time.
The specific periods of time in this study were:
Peak GRF correlated with Energy Flow across the trunk and pelvis whereas Impulse GRF correlated with all three (pelvis, trunk, and arm).
The fact that Impulse was superior to Peak shouldn‚Äôt surprise us that much once we know their definitions.
There‚Äôs some research that impulse GRF does a better job of predicting other dynamic movements like jumping compared to Peak GRF. (McBride et al. 2010).
Since these types of actions are executed over short periods of time the Peak doesn‚Äôt play as much of a role since athletes don‚Äôt have the time to display their highest level of GRF.
To truly reach your highest Peak muscle contraction we need more time.
This is why true strength tests like squats and deadlifts take a second or two to complete.
In exercise science labs they will often use isometric contractions where you get 3 seconds or more to ramp up the amount of force you can produce.
The time period between peak knee height and front foot contact isn‚Äôt that long and as a result it seems that the amount of force produced during this time period is more important than just one hard push.
At Tread, we‚Äôve spent a lot of time talking about how intent is important but the timing and sequencing of that intent may be even more important.
Too often when someone is told that they need to ‚Äúuse their legs more‚Äù it usually results in them pushing into the ground too hard, too early, and with the wrong muscle sequence.
This type of result, pushing harder = lower velocity, was reported in one of the first studies that I ever came across that used a force plate embedded into a mound (MacWilliams).
They reported a positive correlation between force being put into the ground and hand speed/ball velocity.
However, they reported on several occasions that some of the highest peak forces resulted in reduced hand speed/ball velocity.
On several occasions‚Ä¶some of the highest peak forces resulted in reduced hand speed/ball velocity.
What happens might be that too much force was produced too soon and couldn‚Äôt be integrated into the rest of the delivery and/or the stride leg didn‚Äôt have enough strength to accept and re-direct this force resulting in a slower throw.
We‚Äôve all seen athletes that leap off the rubber with a forceful jump, but they aren‚Äôt able to capture any of that force into useable, rotational energy that can find its way into the arm.
That brings us to the results of the¬†stride leg.
Peak GRF had a connection with the trunk and throwing arm while impulse GRF again was correlated with all three Energy Flow measures.
There was one occasion when Peak GRF outperformed Impulse and that was in the case of the stride leg amount of Energy Flow through the throwing arm.
This is important because as we covered earlier when I was defining Energy Flow, this particular measure had the highest correlation with ball velocity.
Peak GRF of the front leg has been associated with ball velocity in other studies. (McNally et al) found that the peak vertical GRF forces were essentially the rate-limiting factor when they tested some recreational adult pitchers.
The difference other than the age of the subjects was that in the current study they looked at horizontal forces.¬†These findings are great since they give us some insight as to where the force from the front leg needs to be directed, both back and up in a short amount of time.
The authors went even further in their discussion of the results with this great statement that the actions of the front leg may:
‚ÄúAllow the lateral aspect of the pelvis of the back leg the chance to rotate prior to the trunk.‚Äù
This sheds light on the fact that the front leg action isn‚Äôt simply a ‚Äúcar crash‚Äù reaction.
This is something that Ben has said over and over in various videos, but the fact that it‚Äôs being mentioned in a peer-reviewed research article should give it more authority.
The ‚Äúcar crash‚Äù statement really only tells us that the front leg has to brake in the sagittal plane, front to back.¬† Previous research has shown that front leg action at the knee requires to go from a flexed to a more extended position during the time that the front foot hits to when the ball is released.
The problem is that it doesn‚Äôt take the rotational component of the front leg into account.
This statement about the ‚Äúlateral aspect of the pelvis‚Äù highlights that in order for the lateral/outside aspect of the back leg to rotate around means that the lateral/outside aspect of the front leg has to rotate backwards.
This gives us more of a 3D idea of what‚Äôs happening.
In the sagittal plane, the front leg is extending while in the transverse plane the hips need to rotate.¬† In terms of the frontal plane (side-to-side), we don‚Äôt want to see much action at all.
If we do some movement in the frontal plane, it will often be labelled as an ‚Äúenergy leak‚Äù which is obviously not a good thing when we are trying to optimize Energy Flow.
In summary we need a lot of force production from the lower half, but all force is not created equal if the timing/sequencing is off.
The back leg doesn‚Äôt get a chance to display its full strength since we are starting from a complete standstill.
This data suggests that for the drive (rear) leg, having a gradual build-up of force that can be effectively translated into the rest of the delivery may be more effective than one giant jump or push off the rubber.
It‚Äôs similar to quote about financial income ‚Äúit‚Äôs not how much you make it‚Äôs how much you keep.‚Äù Just watch ESPN‚Äôs 30 for 30 documentary called ‚ÄúBroke‚Äù to understand what I mean.
For the stride (lead) leg, we need that leg to provide us with some force quickly.¬†Luckily this can happen in a timelier manner since it‚Äôs a reactionary type of movement that relies on the stretch shortening cycle (SSC).
However, this still requires a base line of strength in order to take advantage of the elastic properties of the lead leg.¬†This is similar to a ‚Äúspringy‚Äù athlete trying to do too high of a drop jump when they don‚Äôt have the strength to display their springs.
One of Tread‚Äôs objectives in the coming year is to build a pitching mound with an embedded multi-directional force plate. This will provide our in-house athletes an extra layer of valuable feedback on top of slow motion video and advanced pitch metrics from Rapsodo and Trackman.
Knowing vital pieces of information in regards to the lower body force like when, how much, and where will be another step towards both optimizing mechanics and performance.

RJ Petit's Journey To Throwing 98 MPH & Drafted,2021-09-07T21:43:18+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/rj-petit/,"RJ Petit burst onto the scene last season (2021) after sitting low to mid 90s for Charleston Southern University, posting a 2.79 ERA in 84 IP and being selected in Big South Baseball First Team All-Conference.
RJ joined us shortly after finishing his season and made quick progress, touching 97.3 in a pen and further developing his change up.
After getting drafted by the Detroit Tigers this July (14th Round), we asked him to take us through his journey to getting signed.
I was playing baseball at 3 with my dad flipping balls for me to hit.
I was honestly a better hitter than pitcher growing up. But pitching slowly took over the older I got and I ended up enjoying it more than hitting so I decided to put more of my time into it.
Fast forward to high school and I was pretty good my first few years but it was nothing too special and I hadn‚Äôt had any exposure to college coaches. After my junior year, I knew I wanted to play college ball but that door was closing fast with my fastball only around 83-85.
I decided to get on a Velo program and played that summer for the Canes. Through that exposure and working hard on my velo program, I received multiple offers that summer and committed to Charleston Southern.
I decided to reach out to Tread after one of my close friends on my team told me about Tread and what they had to offer.
I thought it was a really good idea and Tread happened to only be 15 minutes from my house in Rock Hill, SC so it worked out perfectly.
I believed Tread could help me sharpen my breaking pitches and get a better feel for them by using different technologies. These tools would give me a better idea of what I‚Äôm doing and give me new ways to sharpen my arsenal.
From working with Tread for such a short period of time, only a few months, I have made immense strides in my game. My fastball pen velocity has gone up about 2.5 from my previous PR, my slider before was anywhere from 81-84 in game, to averaging 85-87 now.
My changeup made the biggest improvement, not only in velocity, but consistency.
I never had confidence in my changeup but once I got to work and began using the slow-motion video and Trackman, I could actually see what I was doing up close and make the changes which clicked for me mentally.
For me, I try not to have low points while I train or compete. I have accepted that there are going to be times that I am not at my best and those times can last for an extended amount of time. I continuously tell myself to not ride the waves.
My goal has always been to make those waves as small as possible. I try not to ride the highs too high or the lows too low, keep going at the same intensity, focus everyday and not get caught up in the successes and failures.
I have accepted over the years that I am not the best at everything.
I‚Äôm probably never going to be the strongest, or the most mobile, or the fastest guy. I‚Äôve accepted that, and in doing so, I can focus on myself.
Too many people try to compare themselves to someone else and that just isn‚Äôt healthy because no two people are the same. If i can work on the things and get better at what I‚Äôm lacking in, the growth can be incredible.
The next thing I changed is not in my training specifically, but what I do outside of training and competing to maximize those activities.
Making sure I am putting the right things in my body, staying hydrated, and getting enough sleep have just as much if not more of an impact on your development than just training hard everyday.
These changes I think come with time and maturity and also fully understanding what it takes to compete at the highest levels.
I still struggle with positive thoughts at times.
I expect a lot from myself and sometimes beat myself up when I don‚Äôt do something how I want to. I don‚Äôt give myself any slack which is good because I hold myself to a certain standard.
The reality of it though is that I‚Äôm not always going to be at peak performance and that it is okay to not be perfect, and just to work with what you got on any given day.
I have gotten much better at this and it really is a tightrope of finding when to cut yourself some slack because you‚Äôre a human and things won‚Äôt always be how you want them to be.
One piece I would give to my younger self and any younger kid, is to just flat out enjoy it. I‚Äôve been blessed to play this game, and now I get paid to play a kids game.
I can‚Äôt ask for much more, and I think that stems from enjoying all the little things. Cherish all the friendships you make and the memories you have.
I have seen so many friends and teammates fall out of love with the game because things don‚Äôt go their way or even because of a coach.
Feed off the love for the game and enjoy the process and where this game can take you.
One thing I think people don‚Äôt realize about Tread is that their goal isn‚Äôt to just get you to throw crazy hard.
That‚Äôs obviously an outcome that people want to get from it, and you will if you stick to your plan. Every single program made is different.
There is no cookie-cutter plan that everyone has. Tread takes a look into your deficiencies and the coaches find ways to improve these areas. As a result, your numbers will go up, your secondary pitches will see growth as well.
It‚Äôs not just slamming plyo balls and building arm strength. It‚Äôs about getting the body into a position to move efficiently which in turn makes you throw harder and become a better pitcher.
[Tread is] not just about slamming plyo balls‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs about getting the body into a position to move efficiently.
Working with RJ in house leading up to the draft we didn‚Äôt want to make too many major changes.
Taking a look at his assessment and training history, our focus was on fine tuning the things he already did well.
A major focus was throwing his slider harder, without sacrificing movement.Aside from his baseball skill, RJ immediately became a big presence at Tread HQ from the moment he walked in the gym.
Whether it was saying hello to each athlete and coach as he walked in or with his pre-throw juggling routine, RJ is someone other people want to be around.
As a coach I am lucky to work with RJ, and Tread is lucky to call RJ one of its athletes.

A Letter to my Younger Self: 10 Lessons for High School Pitchers,2021-03-11T16:56:22+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/10-lessons/,"You don‚Äôt know me, but I know you.
You‚Äôd give anything to play alongside the superheros you see on TV. To channel that combination of power and precision into a baseball.
To make it do ungodly things from 60 feet, 6 inches.
If they can do it, why not me? You ask yourself.
Don‚Äôt lose that na√Øvet√©, as it‚Äôs going to keep you moving forward even with the odds stacked against you.
You don‚Äôt know how you will get there ‚Äì just that you‚Äôre willing to pay the price, whatever it ends up being. You aren‚Äôt afraid of the work either ‚Äì far from it. But what you need isn‚Äôt more motivation, it‚Äôs a game plan.
I‚Äôm here to help you learn from my mistakes, so you can spend a little bit more time on the mound blowing fastballs by hitters and a little less time in the training room, on the operating table and on the sidelines.
You aren‚Äôt wrong about your potential, but potential without a plan is meaningless.
So let me share some fundamental ideas that may guide you more clearly through this path that you‚Äôve chosen.
You‚Äôve never been around hard throwers, your fastball scrapes low 70‚Äôs, and your high school can‚Äôt name the last player who went on to pitch in college ‚Äì but the first trap you must avoid is setting subconscious boundaries for yourself.
As your abilities begin to grow, you‚Äôll fight the urge to question what effect your genetics may be having on your goals.
You‚Äôll question what‚Äôs possible, and if it‚Äôs worth pouring yourself into a goal that may sometimes seem out of reach ‚Äì especially when the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù make it seem as though the only way is to be a physical specimen with perfect mechanics ‚Äì two things that you‚Äôve never been or had.
You‚Äôve got limits ‚Äì but it isn‚Äôt yours or anyone else‚Äôs job to decide what those limits are ‚Äì it‚Äôs your job to uncover them.
When you get to college and you‚Äôre surrounded by talented pitchers (many of them ironically weaker and less athletic), you will come to realize that most of them aren‚Äôt the freaks that you imagined they would be, just that they‚Äôve learned to coordinate their bodies more efficiently than you.
We‚Äôll talk about how to fix your mechanics at a different time, but for now, wipe that doubt away and take these hard throwers off the pedestal that you‚Äôve put them on. If you want to be in their shoes, you have to study how they got there ‚Äì not idolize them or write them all off as ‚Äúfreaks.‚Äù
It will be hard to believe, but the irony is that one day people will call you a ‚Äúfreak‚Äù ‚Äì when you know that is far from the truth.
Don‚Äôt justify your current lack of ability by elevating those above you ‚Äì it‚Äôs a waste of time and energy.
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going, any road will take you there.‚Äù ‚Äì Lewis Carroll
You may feel like you‚Äôve got nothing but time ‚Äì but the truth is that every day counts.
Every day the clock is ticking on your career.
You think that freestyling your training and throwing routines will work ‚Äì and the truth is that it will ‚Äì to a point.
But are you getting where you need to go at the optimal rate?
If you aren‚Äôt specific about what metrics you‚Äôre looking to improve, and don‚Äôt continuously monitor them, you will continue making subpar progress at best.
You want to gain weight? Measure it every day.
You want to add velocity? Do you even own a radar gun?
You want to increase your squat by 50 lbs‚Ä¶are you tracking your progress with a specific plan?
It seems obvious, but you‚Äôll come to realize that your biggest plateaus continue to be getting away from being intensely specific about your short-term goals, establishing which metrics will get you there, and then measuring your progress with ruthless consistency along the way.
You aren‚Äôt going to want to hear this, but you will waste roughly 3 of the next 4 years because you think you can do it on your own.
And the truth is that you probably can, but the baseball world isn‚Äôt going to wait around for a decade for you to finally stumble on the right answers.
What you are failing to account for by trying to learn and do everything on your own is the value of time and efficiency in the pursuit of your goals.
The value of a good mentor or coach isn‚Äôt necessarily in having the quick-fix answer on day one, but in providing guidance on what mistakes not to make.
Lifting 7 days per week? Maybe don‚Äôt do that experiment.
Yanking your elbows back to scap load? Yeah, that‚Äôs not going to work.
Jumping off the rubber? Let‚Äôs not go down that rabbit hole.
Forcing hip rotation because of what one ‚Äúguru‚Äù says? Let me save you that future back injury.
Momentum pitching? Marshall mechanics? I could go on.
You‚Äôll make hundreds of mistakes over your career ‚Äì each one costing you time, either through injuries or lack of progress, and you‚Äôll look back wishing someone had already learned these lessons ahead of time so you don‚Äôt have to.
I‚Äôm not asking you to blindly follow a single individual ‚Äì just to do whatever it takes to get some guidance from those who have done what you‚Äôre trying to do.
While they won‚Äôt always have the clear answer, mentors serve as valuable guard rails to your journey by helping you understand how to avoid the big mistakes.
One of the reasons I mention finding a mentor is because I‚Äôve seen the fallout from your training blunders.
But the good news is that much of it can be prevented.
Learning proper form and technique from the start isn‚Äôt just about looking good while you squat.
Yes, you‚Äôll get stronger by butchering the free workout plan you downloaded off Bodybuilding.com, but what you fail to recognize is the price being paid for this ignorance.
Training for sport isn‚Äôt just about training muscles ‚Äì any high school football coach can tell you to load up a bar and squat it.
By mastering your technique ‚Äì in everything that you do, you‚Äôll be layering this strength on top of efficient movement and biomechanics.
You will be loading healthy patterns, rather than loading unhealthy and inefficient patterns.
That lumbar rounding on your squatting may feel fine now, but when you herniate a couple discs in college, you‚Äôll realize why chasing short term loading at the expense of technique actually takes you further away from your long term goals.
Remember ‚Äì you aren‚Äôt just ‚Äútraining muscles,‚Äù you‚Äôre loading patterns ‚Äì if those patterns are biomechanically efficient, you will make yourself more resilient to injury.
If those loaded patterns are flawed, you‚Äôll actually be creating a much higher susceptibility to injury ‚Äì both in the short and long term.
One of the main predictors of future injury is prior injury ‚Äì meaning that those who begin to accumulate injuries early on are at a much higher risk for sustaining additional injuries as their bodies begin to compensate around altered and dysfunctional patterns, scar tissue, etc.
Likewise, you‚Äôll come to recognize that the most resilient athletes are the ones who moved well from the beginning. They trained with good form and had efficient mechanical patterns from a young age.
Like a car that is properly tuned, aligned and lubricated, these athletes not only achieve higher performance, but they can put more mileage on their joints in the long term before breaking down.
So cut the ego lifting and shift to a longer term outlook ‚Äì you‚Äôre not doing yourself any favors.
Remember when I told you to find a coach or a mentor?
Well, I want to clarify.
I don‚Äôt just mean to walk down the street to your local pitching coach and assume he has the magic pill that will turn you into the next superstar.
This is your career, and there will be lots of coaches along the way all telling you different things.
Approach their ideas with an open mind, but don‚Äôt forget to ask the why.
A good idea will stand up to scrutiny, and a good coach won‚Äôt be afraid to justify his philosophy and admit when he doesn‚Äôt know the answer.
Likewise, a bad coach will be threatened by your questioning, avoid giving you clear answers and continually remind you that he pitched in AA 20 years ago.
Staying curious but skeptical will allow you to filter out the good from the bad advice with a much higher degree of accuracy.
Once you‚Äôve found advice worth pursuing, make sure to actually measure if it‚Äôs helping.
The best hypothesis in the world isn‚Äôt validated until the data comes in.
That adjustment to your arm action might sound like a great idea, but if you‚Äôre throwing slower it probably isn‚Äôt.
At every step and turn, you‚Äôll find yourself pulled towards the politics of baseball.
Don‚Äôt fall for it.
Politics fall under the category of uncontrollable variables, and you don‚Äôt have the time nor luxury to waste on uncontrollables.
Worrying about playing time, coaches‚Äô favorites, scholarships, scouts, etc. does little to help you continue improving as a player ‚Äì you know, what actually matters.
Keep your head down and work.
Ignore the distractions that surround you.
When you are good enough, the rest of the pieces will naturally fall into place.
Be so good they can‚Äôt ignore you.
This is a lesson you will have to learn the hard way, but more isn‚Äôt better.
Better is better.
Improvement in pitching unfortunately doesn‚Äôt track perfectly with your effort, desire or work ethic.
You can‚Äôt will your body into growing, or your mechanics into improving.
Train smarter, not harder.
Much of this comes back to having a mentor in your corner to stop you from stumbling into a ditch at every step and turn.
When it comes to gaining weight: more isn‚Äôt better.
Eating 10,000 calories per day won‚Äôt get you to your goals faster than eating 5,000.
Find the right calorie and macronutrient balance to elicit progress without excess fat gain.
When it comes to training: more isn‚Äôt better.
Find the right exercises, training volume and intensity to elicit steady progress without overtraining, poor recovery and injury.
Strive for weekly improvements and keep a long term outlook. Almost every time you will try to be a hero and ignore this rule, you‚Äôll end up paying the price.
When it comes to throwing: more isn‚Äôt better.
You must balance workload and fatigue to have productive weeks of throwing without running into overuse injuries and plateaus at every turn.
When you monitor the right metrics, the numbers will tell you when you‚Äôre doing too much.
Listen.
The biggest mistake you will make in high school is to start relying on video analysis to guide your throwing.
You‚Äôre analytical ‚Äì and that‚Äôs not a bad thing.
But you must be careful watching video of yourself throwing, as it will shift your focus away from feel and towards internal cueing, static positions and overanalysis.
Get rid of the video camera during your throwing sessions, find a throwing partner, and allow feel to guide the mechanical changes that you‚Äôre working towards.
You will have a massive spike in velocity once you reach college ‚Äì not because of a specific mechanical change, but in large part because you will be forced to rely on the natural, outcome-based feedback of ball flight to a partner as opposed to the delayed, subjective feedback of throwing into a net and analyzing video after every 5 throws.
Get out of the superdome and learn to speak the language of pitching:
Feel.
Part of the struggle you‚Äôll have in high school is the lack of an environment with other athletes all pushing towards the same goals.
As one of the few athletes at your school with any desire to play at the next level, you will need to be highly intrinsically motivated to make it happen.
Although this isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôve ever struggled with, it doesn‚Äôt make plugging into a good environment any less valuable.
This isn‚Äôt just about making your journey less of a lonely pursuit ‚Äì there‚Äôs something about being around a group of talented individuals that pushes everyone forwards.
Maybe this phenomenon has to do with motivation, or maybe it has to do with fostering competition.
But I think it also has a lot to do with learning.
Being in an environment with other curious, hard-working athletes, you begin to soak up knowledge from each other and come to conclusions and realizations that wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise been possible.
This is true in many other areas in life, where the whole within these types of groups is much greater than the sum of its parts.
Do what you can to find a group of training partners, a training facility or some other environment of athletes who share your goals and you will benefit from this powerful phenomenon.
I know you have it in your head that playing in college means playing Division 1 baseball, but realize that what really matters is going to a school where you will a) develop and b) play.
Do you want to play at a reach school where you‚Äôll be #15 out of 15 pitchers and ride the bench for 3 years?
Or do you want to play at a smaller school known for excellent player development where you‚Äôll be given opportunities much earlier on and still have the ability to chase professional baseball?
Though you will go on to be drafted as a college walk-on, you‚Äôll later come to realize that the process may have been significantly more straightforward had you picked a slightly smaller school where you had a chance of playing from day 1.
Division I baseball is often glorified, but just because you can squeeze onto a roster doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best option for you.
You‚Äôre going to make a lot of mistakes ‚Äì and that‚Äôs okay.
But keep these points in mind as you continue navigating the minefield that is baseball development ‚Äì you will save yourself years of setbacks and accelerate your progress beyond what you thought possible.
Stay humble and don‚Äôt forget where you came from.

2020 Year in Review,2020-12-31T23:22:48+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2020-year-in-review/,"A year ago I updated you with everything that happened at Tread in 2019.¬† Last year we grew from one part-time coach to three full time coaches, added over 200 athletes to our online programming, had 11 athletes drafted, and opened up our first facility, Tread HQ 1.0, in Charlotte, North Carolina.
At the end of that post, I stated that our mission was to continue building out our online coaching service to reach as many athletes and teams as possible while making the service as absolutely awesome as it could be. This would mean continuing to assemble a bright young team of coaches.
I also promised that we would ramp up the production of our free content to continue to provide value to all of the parents, coaches and athletes who follow us for baseball training and development information.
So what happened in 2020? And what are we up to in 2021? Here‚Äôs a recap of what happened this past year at Tread.
In addition to adding hundreds of new online coaching athletes to the Tread family, there was quite a bit of work going on behind the scenes to make it possible.
This meant identifying some of the best and brightest young coaches in the country to continue building out our team.
Performance Coaches
We added four new full-time coaches to our team, including Gabe Noyalis, Justin Liserio, Devin Hayes and Jack Barry.
Each of these guys brings a fresh perspective to our team and have already pushed the boundaries of what we can offer to our athletes with tons of feedback and suggestions for how Tread can continue to improve even more.
We also add two new part-time coaches: Graeme Lehman and Paul Schwendel. Both guys bring a wealth of experience to the arena.
You can read more about Graeme and his research here, while Paul made an impressive comeback into professional baseball alongside his role with Tread (he was up to 99 mph this year at 31 years old).
Directors
We added two director-level positions this year, allowing us to become much more streamlined and productive as Tread‚Äôs growth begins to take on a life of its own.
With the additions of Tanner Reklaitis (LA Angels ‚Äô19-20) as our Director of Operations and Tyler Zombro as our Director of Performance (Rays ‚Äô17-Current), we are fortunate to have a ton of talent in the room helping drive decisions, contribute to ongoing education and shape the future of Tread.
Miscellaneous Additions
Much of what happens to allow Tread to function at a high level comes back to the people behind the scenes.
Bobby Hearn joined us an has served in a sales, marketing and support role, Declan Cronin (White Sox, ‚Äô19-Current) became our Athlete Support Coordinator, and Camden Kay (Data Analytics) is working on some exciting projects that we‚Äôre excited to unveil when the time is right.
It wasn‚Äôt long into the year before everyone was thrown a massive curveball with the pandemic.
Not only were seasons canceled, but facilities were completely shut down with little notice, leaving athletes everywhere scratching their heads as to how they could continue to get better in such a bleak situation.
Shortly after the shutdown, we came out with a free at home training guide to help all of our followers contend with the new reality, and give coaches something they could prescribe to their athletes in the interim.
As most summer seasons went on to be canceled as well, we saw a lot of uncertainty within the baseball world, and were fortunate to be in a position to help these athletes get their training back on track.
Many of the athletes who first discovered us during the pandemic have gone on to make massive strides this year, coming out the other end as totally new versions of themselves.
While there are hundreds and hundreds of stories to tell (many of which we have shared on our Twitter and Instagram accounts this year), here are some of the highlights from our higher level college / pro arms.
2020 was a better year for remote athlete @carterloewen than for most.""I went from topping 90 & sitting 87-88 without a sniff of pro ball, to touching 95 & sitting 91-94 in games and signing a FA deal with the Padres‚Ä¶"" (Continued below) pic.twitter.com/8pAyKffCNM
Very excited to be back in the @Dodgers organization for the 2021 season!  Can‚Äôt wait to throw on that uniform again üôåüèª
Here's an ongoing before/after:This March: @danielblair085 was 86-89 in his last start before shutdown and coming to train at Tread HQ full time.First pen since quarantine: 95-97 mph (average ~95.4, t97.3)A lot can happen in 5 months. pic.twitter.com/ebtwCVQyVv

As Tread‚Äôs reputation has spread,  higher-level athletes have begun to take notice. 9 new current and former MLB pitchers joined our online-coaching family, some of them also opting to train in-house as well.
Here‚Äôs a look at some of them:
""Online coaching is for shmucks.""These MLB pitchers we work with would disagree.#TreadFamü§Æ pic.twitter.com/Ra6BNYzHrU
While much of the year was based around improving our systems to handle more athletes and building our team, I was able to shift my attention to full-time content production in October.
Our goal with content isn‚Äôt to inundate our followers with meaningless noise, but to answer pertinent questions that aren‚Äôt being talked about.
Since October, we cranked out 39 Youtube videos (most of them upwards of 20 minutes long).
While we could be spending these hundreds of hours a month building out paid content or using these videos as the building blocks of a certification/course, we feel that the industry has a need for this stuff to get out there.
As one pro coach told me, most of the free thinkers in the baseball world are working for a pro team, which stifles their ability to share anything they discover as teams look for a competitive advantage.
This isn‚Äôt to say that we won‚Äôt ever come out with courses or certifications (we will), but it is to say that I remember being that 16 year old kid with limited knowledge and resources at my disposal.
Here are some of the most viewed posts and videos from 2020:
We reviewed and ultimately partnered with several products / companies, most notably the Arm Care App by Crossover Symmetry and the Whoop Strap 3.0.
While the Arm Care App is a possible game changer for coaches to automate and individualize their players‚Äô post throwing arm care, the Whoop is still our favorite recovery wearable on the market.
We are also still big believers in both the Marc Pro / Marc Pro+ and the Pocket Radar, with a large number of our athletes using them. We use the Marc Pro in our in-house post throwing recovery protocols and find the Pocket Radar to be a great buy for the value, especially with the ability to now use an iPad or iPhone as an LED display.
This past quarter we began to send out a biweekly email newsletter to our followers so that you can always keep up with our best content, news and updates.
If you‚Äôd like to be added to this newsletter so that you don‚Äôt miss any future content, sign up below:
So where are we headed in 2021? While I can‚Äôt spill the beans quite yet, I will say that we have some BIG news headed your way in the next couple months.
I also wanted to take the time to thank our team ‚Äì and especially my partner Coan for believing in the vision and kicking ass in 2020. Now it‚Äôs time to up the ante in 2021.
Are there any products, content or offerings you would like to see us add in 2021? Let us know by shooting an email to [email¬†protected]. We take your feedback seriously and incorporate as much of it as possible into our planning.
Here‚Äôs to reaching your potential,

I Stopped Strength Training and Went From 96 to 99 MPH at 31 years old,2020-11-18T23:20:53+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/high-velocity-training/,"By Paul Schwendel
My name is Paul Schwendel and I‚Äôm a coach at Tread.
I‚Äôm also a pro pitcher.
In this article I‚Äôm going to share my story and 2020 training strategy, where I made my way back into pro ball at 31 years old and gained nearly 4 mph to my average fastball.
If you‚Äôre a strength coach and your blood is boiling over the title ‚Äì and implication that pitchers shouldn‚Äôt strength train ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry. We still use heavy strength training with the majority of our athletes.
Before I share what I did and how you can potentially incorporate some of these principles into your own training, let me give you some context on my personal training journey.
You might see the clip above and shrug me off as another genetic freak. But while I am 6‚Äô5‚Ä≥, I haven‚Äôt been a hard thrower my whole life.
Far from it.
I was a walk-on pitcher at D3 Emory University from 2008-2012, where I struggled for 3 years (throwing 85-87) but had a breakout year as a 5th-year senior (touching 94).
After being drafted by the Rangers in the 40th round, I spent two seasons in their system before I was released in 2014 with medial elbow pain. I was 91-94 at this point, but inconsistent with my velocity on a game to game basis.
I got a 9 to 5 desk job for the next few years while struggling with elbow pain throwing, and had all but given up on the dream of pitching professionally.
After meeting Ben Brewster and talking to him about my elbow, I had UCL repair surgery in 2018 and spent the next year and a half rehabbing, during which I started training remotely with Tread.
I touched 96 in a men‚Äôs league game in 2019 and was able to play Indy Ball this season in the American Association for the Chicago Dogs.
After experimenting with more high velocity and ballistic/plyometric training early this year, I saw a large increase in bullpen velocity (from 90-92 to 94-96 indoors) that carried over to the game, where I sat 95-97 and touched 99 this season.
If you‚Äôre a pitcher who has been training for a couple of years or more, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve experienced plateaus in velocity or performance spanning months or even years at times.
While velocity gains seem to come relatively easy for younger trainees, at a certain point it just isn‚Äôt possible to see 8 mph gains in velocity that coincide with 20 lb gains in muscle mass over the span of 6 months.
At a certain point, the general strength improvements caused by even the best lifting program show diminishing returns when it comes to progression in velocity on the mound.
I know, I wish throwing hard was as simple as having a 600 lb deadlift and bench pressing 350 lbs too ‚Äì but unfortunately I don‚Äôt make the rules.
Let‚Äôs explore some reasons this is the case.
When we‚Äôre relatively untrained, adding muscle mass and general strength correlates well to gains in throwing velocity.
We‚Äôve all seen the 150 lb string bean who adds 20 lbs over the summer and comes back to school throwing 5 mph harder.
Ben did a write-up on this a few years ago where one travel org Tread trained saw an average gain of 6.7 miles-per-hour in a 3 month training period.
The reason this is possible is that general strength improvements tend to have a positive impact on our ability to produce force at any velocity. So when Johnny is a sophomore in high school, and his bench press 1RM goes from 130 lbs to 200 lbs, there‚Äôs a very good chance that he will see a large increase in throwing velocity.
The reasons for this are numerous (better activation of prime movers, gains in tendon stiffness, improved lateral force transmission) but beyond the scope of this post.
However, at a certain point, gains in maximum or absolute strength (i.e. training that increases your one-rep max) provide diminishing returns to increasing power output.
You may also hear this referred to as high-velocity strength, strength-speed, speed-strength, explosive strength or special-strength.
While there are subtle distinctions between some of this terminology, what ultimately matters as a pitcher is your ability to apply force quickly, and absolute strength training does a good job at improving this ability to a point.
This is why you don‚Äôt see strongmen or powerlifters who can deadlift 800+ lbs competing on the baseball field. There‚Äôs a point where athletes are strong enough (at least in the context of lifting a barbell), and going from 400 to 500 lbs on a squat may not be worth the training economy it will take to get there.
What I mean by training economy is the idea that you have a limited (finite) amount of capacity to train and recover each day, week and month. You can only recover from so much, and you only have so much time and energy to devote to training, so you want to be reasonably sure that improved performance actually awaits you on the other side.
At Tread, what we‚Äôve seen both in Our Team‚Äòs hundreds of years of combined playing and coaching experience as well as over the 1,000+ athletes we‚Äôve individually worked with (in addition to many more through team consulting) is that there is such a thing as strong enough.
We call this MLB Strong.
Once you‚Äôre as strong as an above-average MLB player, the training focus should shift away from absolute strength (producing maximum force) to power and speed (producing that force as quickly as possible).
We‚Äôll discuss what we feel these exact metrics are in a different post, but feel free to download our Metric Analysis Tool and plug in your own numbers if you‚Äôre curious.
Once a level of general strength is reached, the adaptations with the most bang for their buck are those that are specific to high-velocity force production.
This is where attributes like muscle fiber contractile velocity, early phase force production, decreased antagonist muscle activation, and retention of type IIX muscle fibers (super-fast muscle fibers that are proportionally decreased by resistance training) come into play.
All of these attributes are highly specific to the velocity at which a movement is performed, and some, like type IIX muscle fiber retention and antagonist activation, can even be negatively influenced greatly by heavy weight training, especially in high volumes.
The realization that slow-speed strength training blocks may actually be doing more harm than good for certain athletes was one my biggest takeaways from studying the science of training transfer and the work of coaches like Cal Dietz (author of Triphasic Training) and Chris Beardsley.
In practice, for most throwers this means that going from 80 to 85 mph is likely much different than going from 90 to 95 mph.
While a young trainee might see a 5-10 mph increase in velocity simply by increasing his/her squat or bench press and/or adding 20 lbs of muscle mass, an athlete who has a relatively developed strength base is very unlikely to see those same gains from similar training.
The training approach must evolve as the athlete advances closer to his genetic ceiling.
So how do you decide when to train for what?
While any throwing athlete would benefit from more high-velocity strength, those who have a force-velocity curve geared more towards the force end of the spectrum will likely benefit the most from high velocity training methods.
At Tread we classify springy, force-deficient athletes as ‚ÄúKangaroos‚Äù in need of increased maximum strength while we classify the slower-twitch, reactive-deficient athletes (like I was) as ‚ÄúGorillas‚Äù who are in need of fast-twitch power training.
That is to say ‚Äì athletes should focus on what they suck at relative to everything else. Which for me, was everything at the bottom right of the force-velocity curve below.
While not an exact science, a simple comparison of a vertical jump (also called a counter-movement jump), a squat jump (also called a paused or static jump) and a step-into jump (also called a reactive jump) will give us clues as to how that athlete produces force and where they stand on the force-velocity curve.
How these three jump metrics relate to each other gives us clues as coaches as to how an athlete produces force (at least in the context of a jumping pattern).
We collect this information during the assessment process for our online coaching athletes.
Here‚Äôs a look at a ‚Äúreactive-deficient‚Äù athlete:
He can Pause-Jump the same height as his Countermovement Jump (28 inches), and he only jumps one inch higher on a step-into Reactive Jump (29 inches).
In the context of the Kangaroo-Gorilla classification system, this athlete would be classified as a Reactive-Deficient ‚ÄúGorilla.‚Äù
Athletes who don‚Äôt see an increase in jump height by utilizing a countermovement are generally better at producing force at low velocities as they make poor use of the elastic properties of their muscles, tendons and fascia.
These athletes, like myself, stand to benefit the most from the adaptations caused by a high-velocity strength training program.
You can read more about the specific adaptations caused by ballistic and explosive movements here. I‚Äôd highly recommend following Chris Beardsley‚Äôs work on twitter at @SandCResarch and on Instagram as well. He posts the latest research on high-velocity strength development via concise infographics that I‚Äôve found extremely helpful in my own training and research.
After mixing up my training, I pretty quickly saw a dramatic improvement in my ability to produce force at high velocities that was evident in my bullpen sessions (which went from 90-92 to 94-96 mph).
My relatively advanced training age (I‚Äôd been training in the weight room in some capacity for 12 years at this point) meant that I had a very good base of strength that allowed me to take advantage of this training methodology quickly.
A couple of ways that I‚Äôve implemented this concept into my own training are by including ballistic pushups (thinking ‚Äúget off the ground‚Äù) to train my pec to fire reflexively and adding max intent medball throw variations while tracking with a radar gun.
Here‚Äôs a sample superset from an athlete‚Äôs program along with a few videos of what this types of training entails. We like to work up and down the force-velocity continuum by including contrasts sets, complex sets and french contrast sets. More on those in another post.
These concepts can be applied to every movement in the weight room (squats, rows, pull-ups, cuff work, push-ups, etc).
Take a look at my before and after mechanics (below).
Specifically, I want you to look at the position at maximum scap retraction. Yes, I know the video on the left is a bullpen and the angles are slightly different, but what you‚Äôll see is a noteworthy difference in posture and scap retraction.
It‚Äôs possible this has nothing to do with the high-velocity training, but there is an explanation for how it might.
Plyometric training has been shown to aid in antagonistic relaxation ‚Äì or the ability to turn off opposing muscle groups during high velocity movements.
It‚Äôs possible that my enhanced ability to relax (specifically my pec and anterior shoulder during the arm swing) aided in my ability to avoid muscling up and reach full retraction.
At Tread, we‚Äôre careful about making claims about weight-room training directly impacting pitching mechanics because that‚Äôs a slippery slope, but this is a plausible case that we will be examining further.
If there‚Äôs one thing I would say to young athletes, or a young Paul, it‚Äôs this;¬† strength is important, but how we define strength matters. Are you getting stronger in the context of your sport? Or are you chasing weight room numbers with diminishing returns?
Paul is currently training full-time and is a Tread coach for a number of our athletes including several MLB pitchers. He‚Äôs working towards signing with an affiliated team in 2021 and continuing his push towards pitching at the highest level. You can follow Paul and his journey on twitter.

A Look Into One of the World's Hardest Throwers : Part 2,2020-07-31T21:03:36+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/nate-pearson-2/,"With Nate Pearson making his MLB Debut this week, running it up to 99 mph over 5 scoreless innings (and 104 mph in his career), what better time to dive into what makes him such an elite level thrower?
In part one of this segment, Remote Coach Graham Lehman gave us an in depth look into the physiological side of Nate Pearson, diving into his power metrics during a case study while at the College of Central Florida, and how the combination of his 6‚Äô6‚Ä≥ 245 lb frame and advanced power output contributed to his development of elite level velocity.
For this piece, let‚Äôs dive into his mechanics, and what contributes to his efficiency on the mound.
You can watch our entire video breakdown below. If you‚Äôd rather read, the rest of this article walks through the points made in the video. Disclaimer: we do not coach Nate personally. This is an exploration of his mechanics from afar.
During his initial weight shift, Pearson stays stacked and centered over his pelvis and over his back heel, staying over his center of mass. A common mistake you see in throwers at any level is that the torso starts to tip forward (towards 3B for a righty) and there will be a gradual leaking forward over the toes during the initial move forward.
Please note: this does not mean he‚Äôs coming to a balance point, just that his torso is staying over the pelvis as he moves forward. You can check another example of this here.
Pearson holds this stacked position in his initial forward move, then loads into a rotational hinge which he rides down the slope (this rotational hinge is a coiling of the pelvis over top of the rear femur into hip IR).
As he begins to unload the pelvis into landing, Pearson is able to direct this move downhill. The direction of the rotation is all in the same plane from the hips, to the torso, to the arm ‚Äì all unloading sequentially and in the same plane of rotation through release.
One interesting note about Nate Pearson, is that during his forward move a ‚Äúvertical shin‚Äù is no where to be found, which is a common teach amongst pitching coaches (some even considering it an absolute tenet of efficient mechanics).
Into his drive phase, Pearson demonstrates an internal rotation dominant back leg as opposed to the external dominant ‚Äúvertical shin‚Äù or what most would see as holding the knee over the toes for an extended period of time.
Something to keep in mind, this preference may be somewhat dictated by your hip anatomy and through trial and error to establish what ultimately works best for the athlete as far as velocity, command and feel are concerned.
As he moves forward down the mound, Pearson loads into that hinge position, where the pelvis is coiled over the top of the femur (the ‚Äúrotational hinge‚Äù).
If you notice his pelvic positioning, it is significantly turned over the femur, which creates a winding coil into the rear glute during the linear move. He holds this closed pelvis position as long as possible down the slope before releasing the pelvis just before FFS.
The idea of ‚Äúrotating down into landing‚Äù is a cue or teach to encourage the athlete to open the pelvis on a downhill vector to ultimately match the plane of rotation of the shoulders. Another way of looking at this is not spinning into landing but landing ‚Äúfrom above.‚Äù
A common theme with hard throwing, taller athletes is that many of them benefit from a more compact arm action. This does not mean getting into a crazy degree of elbow flexion (i.e. hand to the ear), but managing the length of the arm spiral or downswing.
When you are dealing with guys with extremely long wingspans, keeping that arm bent closer to 90 degrees during the arm swing tends to help them repeat their release point and get the arm in the plane of rotation easier.
We don‚Äôt force these changes through, but if some tinkering and split-testing shows positive trends, we will often recommend they stick with the change provided they have enough time in the off-season to ingrain the new pattern.
Something to keep in mind when creating a compact arm action, we aren‚Äôt talking about tensing up the arm or yanking the hand in close to the ear.
As you can see below, Pearson is allowing plenty of scapular retraction to occur behind the body, letting the arm ‚Äúfloat‚Äù into position so that he can keep the arm on time, allow it to flip up into landing and direct all of his rotation downhill.
The video below mentioned an interesting fact: Nolan Ryan was one of Pearson‚Äôs idols and mechanical models growing up.
While the mechanical similarities are obvious, something worth mentioning is that both of them have a very high level of intensity in their deliveries, but without muscling up or ruining the flow of their patterns.
You may have heard this referred to as ‚Äúintent‚Äù but I like to think of it as rotational violence as many coaches have pointed out the vagueness of the word ‚Äúintent‚Äù to refer to this concept.
As you can tell in the video above, Nate Pearson clearly throws at a true 100%, but the application of intent is timed such that he isn‚Äôt ruining the smooth flow of kinetic energy from the ground/lower half.
We tell our athletes to ‚Äúlet the throw build‚Äù from the lower half, keeping the upper half relaxed through the linear move until that rotation up the chain ultimately triggers the reflexive stretch of the pec at FFS.
From there, Nate actively contracts to add to that stretch shortening cycle and is closing the gap as fast as he can, ripping through with his front side obliques and throwing arm pec / lat, as he finishes with electricity.
As a coach, you‚Äôve got to be careful telling athletes to just throw with ‚Äúintent‚Äù as it can ruin their sequencing and lead to the arm being added to the throw prematurely and ‚Äúmuscling up‚Äù the throw. You can learn more about that concept here.
Another interesting piece of Nate Pearson‚Äôs mechanics is the extreme degree of trunk extension. There is a common misconception about extension, the idea that you need to actively try to reach with your arm into ball release. You‚Äôll see coaches and player‚Äôs set up a bucket out in front of them and actively do towel drills to reach out and hit the bucket as a way of faking their way to ‚Äúgetting out front‚Äù.
Trunk extension is a byproduct of a well sequenced load and unload and properly dissociating the pelvis from the torso.
Pearson organizes his body into an efficient position at FFS which triggers a rotational catapulting effect of the torso over the front side into release.
With his height and wingspan, this makes the perceived velocity of his 100 mph fastball even higher as he releases so close to the plate.
It can be hypothesized that this has something to do with the longer levers of these elite level throwers. For example, Arquimedes Caminero and others with extremely long arms often demonstrate greater trunk extension at ball release and appear to hold onto the ball a lot longer than guys with shorter arms. I don‚Äôt have anything concrete to back up this hunch yet but there seems to be a correlation.
In short, when a coach says ‚Äúget on top of the ball‚Äù or ‚Äúget out front‚Äù, these are usually inefficient cues because the athlete yanks open the front side and tries to reach out and artificially create this extension.
Trunk extension is a byproduct of sequencing the start of the throw properly, not something we artificially force by reaching out as far as you can at the last second.
This point is fairly obvious, but part of the reason why Nate Pearson throws so hard is because of his large frame and his genetics. There are a whole lot of things that have to go right to throw 104 mph.
If you took Nate‚Äôs mechanics and put them on a shorter, less athletic, less explosive, less powerful athlete ‚Äì maybe he tops out at 92 mph instead of 104 mph.
Throwing 100 mph certainly requires some sort of mechanical efficiency, but it is not as simple as saying ‚Äúif you throw like this guy you will throw 100 mph.‚Äù
We all intuitively understand that the frame, genetics, power output, mobility, and many more variables ultimately influence the genetic ceiling an athlete has.

An In-Depth Look Into One of the World's Hardest Throwers (part 1),2020-06-19T19:31:16+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/nate-pearson-1/,"Before spring training was brought to a halt, one of the biggest stories was just how dominating Nate Pearson of the Toronto Blue Jays was during his outings.¬† In his first six innings, he faced the minimum and struck out 15 over 3 appearances. Now, spring training stats are nothing to get excited about but his ‚Äústuff‚Äù is definitely worth getting excited about.¬† Namely, his triple-digit fastball making him one of the hardest throwers on the face of the earth.
At Tread, we love analyzing the fastest throwers in the game so that we can continue to gain more insight as to what the best in the business do so that we can learn and then pass this information along.¬† And that‚Äôs exactly what we are going to do here with Nate Pearson.
What‚Äôs going to really make this article really interesting is that we have some in-depth knowledge in form of some physical testing and measurements that will shed some light on exactly how he and his body creates this elite level of velocity.
In the 2017-18 NJACC season, when Nate won the Rawlings Golden Spikes award, I was a remote strength coach with his team, the College of Central Florida Patriots led by coach Marty Smith.
As part of my initial assessment we had the whole team run through an extensive set of tests so that I could gather as much information as I could before writing up a training program.¬† Being a remote coach, this step is vital. The more information I could get the better ‚Äì this something that is a cornerstone for how we assess and program for our remote athletes here at Tread.
It should be noted that during that time he was (only) topping out at 94 mph.¬† So, it is really only a snap shot in time but I think it‚Äôs still valuable information.
It was an amazing to see his progression happen so quickly where he was touching 100 mph in late November to throwing 102 mph in front of scouts prior to the draft.¬† By no means am I trying to say that it was me and my training program that led to these results.¬† The biggest factors were Nate‚Äôs hard work and the coaching staff at the College of Central Florida, most notably their pitching coach Zach Bove who is now with the Minnesota Twins.
Since the guys at Central Florida were so on board I was able to get any information I wanted which allowed me to get a more comprehensive look at each athlete.
To assess athletic ability, I had them run a series of tests that included various types of sprints, jumps and med ball throws.¬† To get an idea behind why I choose these particular tests check out this article I wrote a while back title ‚ÄúMLB Combine‚Äù.
Let‚Äôs take a look at how Nate performed starting with the jump.
When we look at the vertical jump we see that Nate‚Äôs scores are good but they don‚Äôt jump off the page.
His 26.3‚Äù score put him 6th best on the team and below the reported scores from professional players that were published in 2002.¬† That‚Äôs not bad for a guy his size.¬† But it‚Äôs when you take into consideration his size that you see him outperform his team and these professional players. This power formula has a way to factor in body weight in order to see how much power an athlete produces when they jump.¬† So, in order for Nate to get his 245 lbs off the ground by 26.3‚Äù he had to produce 11503 Watts of power.
This chart shows just how much more power he produces.
This is another simple test that gives you an idea of an athlete‚Äôs ability to produce power. His 9‚Äô2‚Äù jump placed him near the top of the team but again we take power into consideration he‚Äôs way ahead.
The triple jump you see is just three consecutive broad jumps with no stopping between jumps.¬† You SHOULD be able to jump further because of a larger stretch reflex cycle but you first need the strength to decelerate between jumps so that your tendons can apply the extra force.
The fact that Nate does have a positive ratio between his triple jump average (118.5‚Äù) and his broad jump (110‚Äù) means that has adequate level of strength in his legs and elasticity in his tendons.¬† Both good things.
As a note, I used the same formula here for the broad jump that I did with the vertical jump.¬† I know that this isn‚Äôt good science but at the time I did not know of a broad jump power formula.¬† In my quest for more knowledge I came across this one that Dr. Bryan Mann helped produce.
Long Jump (peak power) = -2722 + 43.03 * Body Weight (kg) + 1423 * Jump Distance (meters)
Using this new and improved formula Nate produces 6491 Watts of power while the team averaged 4881 W.
This is the jump that has the highest correlation to throwing velocity due to its specificity to the act of throwing.¬† We see the same trend here.¬† Nate scores relatively well in the top 25% but when body weight is added to the equation he soars to the top‚Ä¶by a lot.
Again, I used the vertical jump formula but even when I use the broad jump formula which is made for horizontal jumps, like the lateral jump, the results are the same.¬† Nate punches out 5963 W whereas the team average was 4016 W.
Pitchers are very rarely going to be the guys that have the fastest times when the old stop watch gets broken out for timing the 60 Yard-Dash.¬† This was the case here again but Nate did have the 8th best time on the team which speaks to his overall athletic ability.¬† For him to get that big frame and 245 lbs of body weight to cover that distance in 7.12 seconds is pretty impressive.
While that is pretty fast the really impressive part is again when you factor in body weight.¬† If you were standing in his way at the finish line you would be on the receiving end of 3345 Joules. What‚Äôs a Joule you ask?¬† Its unit of energy that can be determined using a ¬†simple formula where you take an object, in this case the object is Nate Pearson, and divide its mass in half and then multiply that by his speed squared.¬† Sorry if I lost there with that math talk.
Here‚Äôs the formula written out ‚Äì you might even recognize from a high school physics lesson.
To put that in perspective, an athlete who weighs 180 lbs would have to run a 6.1 in order to produce the same amount of power.
In addition to the traditional 60 yard-dash, I also had the guys at Central Florida run 10 yard-dash‚Äôs and pro-agilities (5-10-5).
These were selected as tests because they give a better representation of the kind of running that actually happens in the game of baseball which places more of an emphasis on acceleration and change-of-direction.¬† Plus, there is some published research out there on these specific tests using pro-baseball players.
Here‚Äôs how he did compared to both his teammates and the data that I just mentioned with the pro-players (keep in mind when you look at this bar chart that a shorter bar means a faster/lower time).
Nate‚Äôs 10 Yard Dash of 1.78 seconds was his lowest ranking.¬† He was 21st on his team out of 35 players.¬† His pro-agility time of 4.8 seconds placed him 14th.¬† But, again, when you factor in body weight the results show just how powerful of an athlete we are dealing with here as he shot to the top for each one.
Throwing a med ball around is fun, not to mention that it can have a beneficial training effect, and has been shown to predict throwing velocity.
Nate was #1 for the backwards throw and #4 for the forwards med ball throws.¬† The backwards toss, for the record, is a better predictor of throwing velocity out of the two.
His dominance here makes sense since it is a power assessment.¬† His high body weight and longer limbs are advantages in this test.¬† He was able to launch a 6 lbs ball 73.5 ft behind him.¬† That‚Äôs far!!! Go ahead and try this one yourself to see just how powerful that really is.¬† The team average was 56.6 ft.
The forward toss team average was 43 ft and Nate scored 49 ft.
The main take away here is that power matters‚Ä¶.a lot!!
The addition of body weight into some pre-existing formulas does a really nice job of showing us what kind of power an athlete can produce.  Nate is a powerful athlete and that is huge contributor to his evolution from gangly college pitcher to one of the world‚Äôs hardest throwers.
Stay tuned for part 2 next week where we will be breaking down Nate‚Äôs throwing mechanics to help complete the puzzle regarding his elite velocity.

US vs. Korean Baseball - Are There Mechanical Differences?,2020-05-26T18:10:32+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/korean-baseball/,"By Graeme Lehman, MS, CSCS
In honor of the Korean Baseball League starting up, we are going to explore this great study that looked at the mechanical differences between professional pitchers in America and Korea.
What makes this study interesting is that the American pitchers threw about 10% harder than their Korean counterparts.¬† The study then dives deep into the mechanical and physical differences between these two groups so that we can see what allowed for this variation in velocity.  This information obviously becomes useful for anyone trying to improve their own throwing velocity.
This study was performed in 2002 by Escamilla with the help of Dr. Glen Fleisig and Dr. James Andrews.¬† These three have pumped out some of the best baseball research over the last 20+ years.
So let‚Äôs look at the differences between the American pitchers, whose velocity averaged 85 mph in the study, compared to the Koreans‚Äô who averaged 77 mph in these testing conditions.¬†Both groups threw 8-10 fastballs after performing their usual pre-game warm-up, and instructed to throw with 100% effort. For reference, this study was conducted in 2002 when the MLB average velocity was 89.9 mph and the KBO average velocity was ~85 mph according to this source.
And while these velocities might not excite you it should also be noted that velocities reported in research labs aren‚Äôt as eye-popping as what we see on TV.  You should try throwing in your underwear covered with 30 plus markers and see what happens to your velocity.¬† Unless you have a hype man and just drank a Red Bull (or your name is Tucker Davidson), I bet it goes down too.
The American pitchers were taller and heavier at 183 lbs and 5‚Äô11‚Äù.  Keep in mind that this was in 2002. This was compared to the Korean group who weighed in at an average of 177 lbs and stood at about 5‚Äô9.5‚Äù.
The Americans also had slightly longer arms when measured from the acromion to the radial styloid process.¬† The average American arm length was 25.3‚Äù compared to 24.4‚Äù.
The authors of this study stated that ‚Äúapproximately 50% of the variability in ball velocity can be explained by these anthropometric variables, with body mass being the most predictive in determining ball velocity.‚Äù
This supports the general velocity-building idea of ‚Äúmass=gas.‚Äù¬† However, it can only be attributed to about half of the difference in velocity meaning that the rest must be coming from other variables including their mechanical differences.
Editor‚Äôs note: bodyweight and lean mass are tied to some extent to height. Taller athletes tend to have larger frames, more bone mass, blood volume, etc. Mass=gas isn‚Äôt always the answer for pitchers, as it is the composition of that weight that potentially contributes to velocity. It would also be hard to know if the Korean group at only 1.5 inches shorter and 6 lbs lighter had significantly less muscle mass or if that difference in weight could all be attributed to non-contractile tissue like bone mass. Without more detail from the study, it‚Äôs hard to draw any firm conclusions. See our athlete testimonials for both examples of athletes who lost and gained weight in making their velocity transformations.
At front foot contact (FFC), the American pitchers had more horizontal abduction.¬† This means that they placed more of a stretch across their chest.¬† The authors stated that ‚Äúit is likely that the American pitchers pre-stretched their anterior shoulder musculature to a greater extent that the Korean pitchers.‚Äù
Editor‚Äôs note: one of the assessments that we use with remote athletes is what we call the ‚Äúfield goal test‚Äù to see just how much active horizontal abduction each athlete has (this movement also involves scapular retraction).¬† Without this mobility, it may be more difficult to create maximal velocity since the act of pitching requires a lot of elastic energy from the upper body that happens in part as a result of this pre-stretch. In addition, greater degrees of horizontal abduction lend to larger ranges of motion over which to accelerate the arm (and ball). Learn more about this in our videos on scap retraction, reflexive pec fire, and scapular dig.
For the record, the Americans had -27 degrees compared to -14 degrees.¬† If you put your arms straight out to the sides that would be zero degrees, so anything past that is in the negative.
Another key difference at front foot contact was that the Koreans had more external rotation of their throwing arm with 68 degrees compared to the Americans with 45 degrees.¬†90 degrees would be the forearm perfectly vertical at landing while 0 degrees would be the forearm perfectly horizontal at landing.
So while the Korean pitchers have more ER at FFC contact they have less in the lay-back position that is called the arm cocking position in the research world.
Everyone knows that you need lots of lay-back to throw hard.  This is supported in the research.  Its been shown that pitchers who could throw about 86 mph or harder had about 180 degrees of external rotation.¬† Whereas pitchers who could only throw about 75 mph only displayed about 166 degrees of external rotation. (Matsuo et al. 2001).
This research paper agrees with these results, almost exactly.¬† American pitchers had an average of 181 degrees of external rotation compared to only 167 degrees from the Korean‚Äôs.
More external rotation gives the arm more time and range to transfer momentum to the baseball resulting in more velocity.
Note: while the terms layback and external rotation are often used interchangeably, recognize that not all of that range is occurring at the actual shoulder (glenohumeral) joint. Getting the arm into this position is a paired motion that involves the scapula tilting and the thoracic spine extending. Many tissues are involved in allowing this layback to occur (click here for more info)
What‚Äôs even more interesting is the amount of external rotation that happens between the time when the front foot hits the ground and when the arm reaches this max layback position.¬† While the American‚Äôs had more ER at lay-back they displayed a lot less at front foot contact.¬† The Korean pitchers had 68 degrees of external rotation when the their front foot hit the ground and only traveled another 99 degrees until it reached 167 at lay-back.
The shoulders of the American pitchers went through 136 degrees of external rotation before transitioning to internal rotation. This extra range allows for more eccentric energy to be transferred into internal rotation.¬† Think about trying to jump as high as you can, you won‚Äôt reach your max height if you only bend your knees a couple of inches.¬† You need to give your muscles and tendons more time and energy to really maximize the stretch reflex that is so important in throwing.
Let‚Äôs look at what‚Äôs happening in the rest of the body.¬† There was a significant difference with the front leg mechanics between the Korean and American pitchers from the time between¬†front foot contact (FFC) and ball release (BR).¬† The American pitchers displayed about 17 degrees of knee extension (49 @ FFC, 32 @ BR) whereas the Korean‚Äôs front leg stayed in almost and isometric position only going from 50 @ FFC to 48 @ ball release.
This knee extension allows for a more efficient transfer of power.¬† But just to be clear this doesn‚Äôt just happen in the sagittal plane, to learn more check out the 1-hour mark exactly of this video that Ben put together when he looked at Marcus Stroman‚Äôs mechanics. Or check out his explanation of this ‚ÄúPawback mechanism‚Äù here.
Finally at ball release the Americans had more forward trunk tilt with about 36 degrees compared to only 26 degrees.¬† This again gives the American more time and space which allows them to transfer more momentum to the baseball.
Note: we have found in our coaching that forward trunk tilt, while a potentially effective indicator of mechanical efficiency, is not something that should be directly cued. Rather, it is more of a downstream result of effectively sequencing the throw into landing. An efficient unload propels the torso out over the front leg, but drills that encourage artificially reaching and bending forward at the waist (like most towel drills) can actually be counterproductive.
So there you have it.  When you get this combination of physical advantages (weight and length) and couple them with more efficient positions and patterns you get more velocity.
What‚Äôs interesting is that even as this study was being performed back in 2002, the KBO was undergoing a massive transformation in the way in which they approached training and velocity for their pitchers.
According to this FanGraphs article, as more foreign players began joining the KBO in the early 2000‚Äôs,
Korean pitchers now began focusing on weight training to gain velocity and spin rate. Average velocity thus rose from 85 mph to about 89 in the span of a decade‚Äìa drastic change considering the major league velocity increase of 91.0 to 92.5 in the same period.
I can only imagine that these trends will continue as the rest of the world continues to watch the evolution of MLB player development.
I hope that this provided you with a great checklist for your own mechanics or at the very least you can impress your friends when you‚Äôre watching Korean Baseball.  Let‚Äôs go LG Twins!!  They are my favourite since both my fridge and stove are LG.

Tread Athletics 2019 Year in Review,2020-01-01T20:04:21+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/2019-year-in-review/,"Just over a year ago, I sent out a newsletter to our followers explaining that we were scouring the country for our first full-time coach. A lot has changed since that time period, and I wanted to take some time to fill you in on just how far we‚Äôve come in the past year.
Here‚Äôs an excerpt from my 2018 end-of-year newsletter:
‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve found is that there is an enormous desire, on the athletes‚Äô part, to be guided through their journey ‚Äì often a very long and lonely one, by somebody who understands what that is like‚Ä¶Phase 1 of Tread Athletics is complete ‚Äì to prove that remote training can be implemented effectively, build a loyal following of athletes and coaches, and to carve out a niche in the baseball world.  Phase 2 begins. We plan to increase the amount of free content we put out‚Ä¶double to triple our athlete carrying capacity and massively grow our team-training offerings‚Ä¶.The future is bright, and it begins with finding the next puzzle piece to fit into our mission.‚Äù
So did we find the coach we were looking for? And what are we up to in 2020? Here‚Äôs a recap of what happened this past year at Tread.
With a new coach it began to open up
significantly more man-hours for building out the systems and processes to
deploy our coaching at scale.
If this meant pulling all-night filming
sessions to keep our video library up to date for our athletes, developing
protocols and standards to hold our coaches to, building out systems for
monitoring athlete satisfaction and streamlining the communication process
between athletes and coaches, we did it.
We promise our athletes that we will give them 100%, and it‚Äôs
imperative that we keep that promise even as we grow exponentially.
With this momentum, we brought on
our second full time coach by June, and our third coach by October.
We kept our promise from 2018, and have more than tripled our available coaching slots for athletes, adding more than 200 brand new athletes to the Tread family in 2019.
One of the main projects for 2019
was re-doing our website. But the point wasn‚Äôt to slap some hi-res images on a
landing page and pat ourselves on the back.
Our goal was to have a way to provide
incredible value to anyone who sets foot on our site ‚Äì and provide 98% of it for
free.
This meant building out multiple brand new offerings that would guide athletes, parents or coaches depending on what they needed help with, including:
A small snippet from our free Metric Analysis Tool
This included 6 one-on-one remote trainees and 5 team trainees who implemented our programming in 2019. We‚Äôve now had 27 total athletes drafted since 2017 and coached 5 big leaguers.
It also includes 2nd rounder and then 19-year-old Antoine Kelly, who in 2018 touched low 90s sporadically with limited pitchability. Fast-forward to 2019 and he had gained over 30 lbs and held a 1.88 ERA with 112ks and 21 hits in 52.2 innings for the #1 JuCo in the country.
Oh, did we mention he also sat 95-98? That helped too, as he went on to sign for 7 figures this June.
Here‚Äôs what MLB
had to say about him.
Here are some of the most viewed posts and videos from 2019
Our Marcus Stroman analysis was one of our most viewed videos from 2019
We decided that it makes more sense to dive
deeper than a 10 second Instagram story when answering your questions, so we
began to play around with a long form podcast format. Every month we collect
questions from our Instagram and Twitter followers and answer as many as we can
in an hour-long video podcast.
As long as you all keep submitting interesting
questions, we‚Äôll keep running this series as it has gotten great feedback over
our first four episodes. You can view the most recent episode here.
Check out Q&A #4 to get a taste for this new series.
In early August I spoke at 108 Performance‚Äôs Annual ‚ÄúBridge the Gap‚Äù Seminar.
This was a pitching and hitting development event that featured speakers such as Core Velocity Belt inventor Lantz Wheeler, Perry Husband (developer of the Effective Velocity system) and Andy McKay (Seattle Mariners director of player development).
A photo from my presentation at Bridge the Gap 2019
I spoke on our philosophy here at Tread, diving deep on specifics related to strength training, nutrition and mechanical flaws. The presentation was well received ‚Äì and it‚Äôs clear that much of the information we‚Äôve been working hard to get out there isn‚Äôt falling on deaf ears among the baseball community.
That‚Äôs right. We officially got the keys to our first ever facility this past November in Charlotte, North Carolina.
As anyone who knows us will tell you, we don‚Äôt take this opportunity lightly. This isn‚Äôt going to be some nets and a couple squat racks ‚Äì we‚Äôre putting together the dream facility we wish we‚Äôd had earlier in our careers, with all of the gear, tech and equipment necessary to develop pitchers at an elite level (we‚Äôll release a full tour once the place is up and running in the next 6 weeks).
Tread HQ is coming, and it‚Äôs going to be insane.
While we are staying a remote training
company, this will allow us to begin incorporating in-person visits and
assessments for our athletes in the coming year, and seriously consider
organizing larger seminars, clinics or events in this space in the future.
Our company goals for 2020 are simple; continue to scale out our one-on-one remote coaching offering so that we can service as many athletes around the country (and world) as possible.
***We‚Äôre currently on the hunt for our next full-time remote coach, so if you haven‚Äôt yet applied, check out our careers page for more information.***
We are always keeping our eyes out for talented and passionate individuals who believe in what we‚Äôre doing, so don‚Äôt hesitate to apply and get on our radar.
I also wanted to take the time to thank our team ‚Äì Coan, Denis, Garrison and Rob ‚Äì for believing in the vision and kicking ass in 2019. Now it‚Äôs time to up the ante in 2020.
‚ÄúWork hard in silence. Let success make your noise.‚Äù
I thought I‚Äôd briefly address this since it‚Äôs a recurring
question we get any time old clips of my training and throwing make their way
to our social media.
Since my 2017 elbow surgery, I‚Äôve fought and clawed to get consistently healthy and moving in the proper patterns that have elicited success for me in the past. After tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours invested in therapy, rehab, education and more, I recently conceded that‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶a fundamental change needed to be made to my mechanics. (Did you really think I was going to say that I‚Äôve retired? Fat chance.)
I‚Äôve recently begun throwing full speed again, throwing 70%+
strikes in the mid 90‚Äôs on my first flat ground.
I still have a ways to go to reach many of the previous checkpoints
I‚Äôve established for myself, but I‚Äôll detail the entire comeback in a video
when I reach that level once again.
My 2020 goal is to once again sit 96-98 mph indoors, for
>70% strikes, pain free, and ultimately be able to do that at a big league
reliever‚Äôs weekly throwing workload. Adding in spikes and game adrenaline will
be the final boost whenever I ultimately deem myself ready to showcase for big
league teams (I have no timeline for doing so, so don‚Äôt bother asking).
Are there any products, content or offerings you would like to see us add in 2020? Let us know in the comments or shoot us an email at [email¬†protected] with your suggestions. We take your feedback seriously and incorporate as much of it as possible into our planning.
As always, thanks for reading!
Here‚Äôs to reaching your potential,
Ben

The Theory Behind the Yips in Baseball,2019-03-14T15:46:56+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/yips/,"Today‚Äôs article comes to you from Nick Siegel. Nick‚Äôs pitching journey led him to playing college baseball, going from 78 to 92 mph. During his own journey, he encountered his own struggles with the ‚ÄúYips,‚Äù and after finishing college while rehabbing from tommy john surgery, began to dig deeper into the research looking for answers to a problem that he ‚Äì and many others ‚Äì recognize is far more complicated than the ‚Äúmental weakness‚Äù stigma associated with it. What drew me to publish this piece is that it‚Äôs not just geared at athletes with the Yips ‚Äì Nick neatly ties these concepts into how regular pitchers and coaches can use this research to improve focus, repeatability and command. This article was originally published on his blog and you can follow him for future updates on his research. Also, feel free to reach out to Siegel via email at [email¬†protected].
Rick Ankiel, the pitcher in the St. Louis Cardinals Organization, was a phenom on the mound his rookie year, pitching a fall season in the big leagues by the age of 20. This all came to an abrupt end in the 2000 postseason. Ankiel not only couldn‚Äôt throw a strike ‚Äî he couldn‚Äôt even throw the ball close to the catcher. He threw 5 wild pitches before being taken out by manager Tony La Russa. The next game was even worse. He threw 20 wild pitches in the first inning. Since that post-season appearance, Ankiel has never been able to regain his pitching ability and he had to transition to outfield to remain in baseball.
His problem? The Yips.
‚ÄúThe Yips‚Äù are a sudden inability to throw the ball accurately. Most view the cause of Ankiel‚Äôs as unexplainable. Despite many other players being inflicted in the 20 years since, little or nothing has been done to fix the yips in baseball. There still is no known effective treatment and little is understood about how they develop. Often a player inflicted will be stigmatized as mentally weak, ostracized by teammates who do not want to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the yips, and most likely cut from the roster.
Much of the research done with Yips has been in individual sports such as golf, tennis, archery, and even dart throwing. What has been shown in research with yips-affected athletes is that there are clear neurological and physiological differences between a yipped-up athlete and the rest. Most players are left to the mercy of their coach to overcome the issue. ¬†Some are able to forget their experiences, but many still are never able to get the past failures out of their head.
‚ÄúThe research shows that there are clear neurological and physiological differences between an athlete with the yips and the rest.‚Äù
There is no consensus on the academic definition of the disorder (Pelz, 1989; Philippen & Lobinger, 2012; Smither , 2003). The yips were first described as an occupational cramp (Foster, 1977), that impacted professional golfers. Golf teachers defined the yips as a failsafe shutdown which surfaced following a decline of confidence that stemmed from unsound stroke golf mechanics (Pelz 1989). In the sport of golf, the yips were described as being a psycho-neuromuscular impediment affecting the execution of the putting stroke (Smith, 2003). Philippen and Lobinger also defined the yips as an involuntary muscle contraction that manifests itself differently across sports. From golfers to darts, the yips often involve interruptions of the executions of movements (jerk, tremor, freezing) of the sport specific limb(s). Of course this is accompanied by anxiety. So without question there are psychological, neurological, and physiological components associated with the yips (Clarke, 2015).
My definition of the yips, after review of the literature, is that they are a form of task specific focal dystonia that is heightened by anxiety. Focal dystonia is a condition in which certain muscles that have long been used repeatedly to perform a task, suddenly cannot perform that task anymore. It manifests itself with a loss of awareness of body position and locking of limbs. The ‚Äúlocking of the hand‚Äù feeling that many players report is caused by the muscles in the wrist activating at the wrong time. Because pitching requires hours of practice to fine-tune the exact moment in which the delivery must sequence, any disruption will interfere with strike-throwing ability.
Dystonia disrupts the nervous system‚Äôs ability to allow the brain and the muscles to communicate and control movements. The types of complex movements in sports involve many areas of the brain and the area believed to be most affected by dystonia is called the basal ganglia.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), dystonia is considered to involve a breakdown of the basal ganglia‚Äôs function. The basal ganglia‚Äôs purpose is to control and regulate activities of the motor system so voluntary actions can be performed smoothly.
The structures of the basal ganglia in the hindbrain are also involved in the modification and learning of movements. These structures act indirectly on motor output, via its connection with the thalamus to widespread areas of the cerebral cortex. (Berkowitz, 2012) As such, the basal-thalamus connection plays a major role in learning movements and developing proprioception (body awareness, control and coordination) in tasks such as hitting a golf ball or throwing a baseball.
‚ÄúThe basal-thalamus connection plays a major role in learning movements and developing proprioception in tasks such as throwing a baseball.‚Äù
Since the yips are heavily linked to dystonia (more on the different classifications of yips in a bit), and dystonia is believed to be a deterioration of the basal ganglia, it is fair to use what is agreed upon by NINDS as credible evidence that the breakdown of the basal ganglia function is a possible cause of the yips and that the yips are environmentally sensitive.
It‚Äôs probable that this is what happened to Chuck Knoblauch, another famous case of the Yips:
Examining how this deterioration occurs and the structures inside the brain that are involved in the proprioception of throwing will lead to further theories of how to apply the research of the dystonia continuum into a program to improve the yips in baseball.I
So how does this breakdown of the basal-thalamus pathway occur? It‚Äôs thought to be linked to dopamine. Dopamine is the key neurotransmitter involved in this connection, and is directed from the basal ganglia to the thalamus. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that help cells in the brain communicate with each other. If dopamine is not sent through this channel, the basal ganglia breaks down, which results in the inability to carry out precise movements that rely on finely timed muscle contraction, relaxation and coordination, like throwing a baseball.
‚ÄúIf dopamine is not sent through this channel, the basal ganglia breaks down, which results in the inability to carry out precise movements that rely on finely timed muscle contraction, relaxation and coordination.‚Äù
There is a limbic sector of the basal ganglia which plays a central role in reward learning using dopamine. Extracellular dopamine in the BG is linked to motivational states in rodents with high levels being linked to satiated ‚Äúeuphoria,‚Äù and low levels with aversion (Ikemoto, 2015).¬† The euphoria feeling immediately sounded to me like when a pitcher is in the ‚Äúzone‚Äù, where throwing strikes comes easy.
In humans, it was shown that low dopamine correlates to avoidance behavior, especially among the extreme perfectionist population. (Flett & Hewitt, 2008). This corresponds to the feeling of not wanting to be on the mound, something that almost all pitchers with the yips experience (we‚Äôll get into the perfectionist piece later on). On the flip side, high amounts of dopamine produce higher motivational states, and low aversion (Ikemoto, 2015). To put it into baseball terms, when you focus on the reward of a strike, and block out negative stimuli (like the fear or consequence of throwing a ball), a pitcher will theoretically produce more dopamine, which will not only improve motivation for practicing (creating a positive feedback loop), but also aid the basal-thalamus pathway in the brain which plays a key role in carrying out complex movements with precision.
One study, done by researchers at the University of Parma in Italy collected DNA of 50 world class athletes. The research further shows the importance of dopamine in athletic performance. The study showed a clear positive association between dopamine transporters and top athletes. All 50 athletes tested had top scores in World/European championships and Olympic Games in sports such as basketball, tennis, baseball, canoeing, etc. The study found that the dopamine active transporter, or DAT, and its two variants (DAT genotype 9/9 and allele 9) is more prevalent in elite athletes compared to a control group.
The genotype 9/9 was five times more prevalent in the elite group occurring in 24% of the elite compared to 5% in the controls. Furthermore, allele 9 was almost twice as likely in top athletes than controls, present in 51% versus 30% of subjects (Filonzi., 2015).
‚ÄúWhat this study suggested is a strong role of dopamine in high performance athletes.‚Äù
What this suggested is a strong role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in high performance athletes. This further highlights the importance of emotional control and psychological management to reach high-levels of performance.
One study looked at motor planning during the pre-shot routine of expert golfers and compared it to novice golfers. In expert golfers, increased activation was found in superior parietal cortex, lateral dorsal premotor cortex, and occipital lobes while the novice‚Äôs brains showed more activity in the posterior cingulate, the amygdala-forebrain complex, and the basal ganglia. More overall activity also was found in the brains of the novices than the experts. Solely on the basis of activation of the limbic and basal ganglia regions it was possible for a blind investigator to correctly identify 6/6 expert golfers and 7/7 for novice participants.
‚Äú[In golfers] more overall activity was found in the brains of the novices than the experts.‚Äù
In the study, the novice who had the most inexperience did not activate the limbic regions but exhibited the greatest activation of the basal ganglia. This relates to dopamine because low amounts of dopamine will cause a malfunctioning basal ganglia to overwork.
An over-active basal ganglia tries to produce more dopamine thus disrupting the basal-thalamus pathway and becoming more highly sensitive to feedback given from the sensorimotor area. The muscles require precise timing during the delivery and muscle inhibition is the basal ganglia‚Äôs function. When disrupted, the involuntary movements of the yips can manifest.
Look at the difference from this study in brain activity. The top row (a and c) is a novice, and the bottom row is an expert. The expert has much lower basal ganglia activity (and total brain activity in general):
All of this suggests to me that the novice is too emotionally involved with their result and also cannot organize themselves to repeat any success he may or may not have. Milton also noted that only the novice golfers would ask questions concerning factors such as whether the distance given to each of the holes was similar, and if there was wind or not (despite being told beforehand to assume there was none). Milton thus concludes that novices were actively participating in the task, but were unnecessarily preoccupied with details that were irrelevant for the required task. Hence the reason efficiency in the mind of an athlete is so important is to filter all the unnecessary stimuli and focus on the task.
Two distinct types of yips have been proposed and both are thought to lie on separate ends of a continuum (Smith , 2003; Stinear , 2006) ‚Äî Type I and Type II.
Type I Yips (sometimes referred to as Lost Movement Syndrome or LMS) has been documented in research that suggests that the yips are instigated by a focal-dystonia, which is exacerbated by anxiety (McDaniel., 1989; Adler, 2005; Smith, 2000). However the precise etiology of FD is unknown. Reported dystonia-affected sports other than golf include table tennis (Le Floch, 2010) pistol shooting (Sitburana, 2008) and tennis (Mayer., 1999). Each of the respective sports reported limb or hand dystonia symptoms. Type I yips are also associated with higher intensities of practice, concentration, tension, and years of competition.
Type II yips are considered to be a form of psychologically based choking (Smith, 03). Type II yips are thought to manifest in disrupted attention as a result of increased self focus or distraction (Beilock & Gray, 2007). Interestingly enough while the yips have been known to lead to performance anxiety, there has been no difference noted between the anxiety level of golfers with or without yips during performance (Torres-Russotto, 2008). ¬†This type of yips seems to be related to the individual, as Type II yips is more likely to occur around the ages of 18-20 which is also when generalized anxiety starts to manifest itself in a person.
This increase in self-focus could be because of the environment the athlete is in or no clear cause at all. ¬†Either way, internal rather than external focus is the main aspect of type II yips, rather than an absolute breakdown of the function of the basal ganglia. This likely can be alleviated by turning the focus and attention of the athlete from an internal focus to an external one.
Anecdotally, one minor leaguer that had a promising career derailed by the yips explained the difference to me between his internally focused mentality and his friend who is a successful MLB pitcher. He said he was constantly worried about throwing balls and if he would get demoted, while his friend has a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give a #$% mentality‚Äù about him that allows him to maintain a ‚Äúsee spot, hit spot‚Äù robotic thinking that prevents any yips from developing. ‚ÄúIf he overthrows you and the ball rolls 100 yards down a turf football field, he won‚Äôt care that you have to run back to get it.‚Äù
Following Smith, Stinear (2006) attempted to test the continuum model by employing behavioral (inhibition task), physical (EMG measurements), and psychological (state anxiety scores) measurements to compare groups of non-affected golfers and golfers that were either categorized as Type I or Type II yips.
Stinear hypothesized that the Type I group would show greater muscle activity while putting and more errors on a behavioral inhibition task than the Type II group and non-affected group. Stinear believed this was because patients with FD have shown impaired inhibitory function on several levels of the central nervous system (Torres-Russotto, 2008) and on behavioral responses which results in higher muscle activity and more errors on a behavioral response inhibition task than in control groups.
In addition, because of the strong association between ‚Äúchoking‚Äù and performance anxiety, the authors expected the Type II yips group to show generally higher cognitive state anxiety levels and worse performance under the high-pressure situation as compared to the Type I and control groups. Finally it was expected that once the chance to earn a monetary reward was removed all groups would improve their putting performance.
The results only partially supported the hypotheses. The Type I Group exhibited higher peak muscle activity in the left arm as well as more errors on the inhibition task, as opposed to the non-affected group. There were, however, no differences between the Type I and Type II groups in muscle activity or error scores. In addition, contrary to the predictions, the Type II yips group did not differ in the general level of cognitive state anxiety. Furthermore, the high-pressure condition did not affect the outcome of the Type II group. Yet, when the chance to earn a monetary reward was removed, only the Type II group and the non-affected group improved their outcome score.
(Stinear, 2006) concluded that their study provided evidence for the model of two different types of yips. The golfers who experienced yips could indeed be categorized according to whether they reported mainly movement-related symptoms (Type I) or anxiety-related symptoms (Type II).
‚ÄúThe golfers who experienced yips could indeed be categorized according to whether they reported mainly movement-related symptoms (Type I) or anxiety-related symptoms (Type II).‚Äù
Based in part on these findings, one follow-up study proposed that symptoms which fell in the middle of the continuum, containing both dystonia-related and pressure-related factors, be classified as Type-III yips.
In contrast to what was hypothesized, the results of Stinear (2006) also show that there were no differences between the Type I and Type II groups on a number of measurements. Thus, although it is certainly possible that the two types of yips are caused by different underlying mechanisms, it remains unconfirmed whether the Type I yips are caused by focal dystonia and the Type II yips by choking, as proposed. Despite the potential usefulness of categorizing the yips into different types, there is no validated procedure to do so at this point.
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS) has separated dystonia causes into three groups; idiopathic, genetic, and acquired. Genetic causes are interesting but self-explanatory and idiopathic dystonia refers to dystonias without a clear cause, which is what most dystonias are. The third, which is acquired, is from environmental or other damage to the brain, or exposure to medications.
This highlights the importance that an environment can have on a pitcher. While many yips-afflicted pitchers will have idiopathic causes where no clear reason is determined, I would theorize that many amateur cases of the yips are exacerbated (if not directly caused) by the environment the player is in.
‚ÄúWhile many yips-afflicted pitchers will have idiopathic causes where no clear reason is determined, I would theorize that many amateur cases of the yips are exacerbated (if not directly caused) by the environment the player is in.‚Äù
This does not mean the team is the direct cause, as it is possible the athlete is disrupted by something else going on in his life.
The development of anxiety-based disorders have been linked to history of traumatic experience, with the occurrence of a further traumatic event at a later time triggering the associated symptoms (Dohrenwend , 2013). For example, Rotheram (2007) demonstrated a relationship between Type I yips and a history of traumatic life-events, often experienced years before onset of the yips symptoms. Individuals exposed to trauma and prolonged stress can sometimes suffer adverse effects years after the event (Christianson & Marren, 2008; Forbes, 2007). Roberts, (2013) proposed that self-consciousness might be a characteristic of the yips, and suggested that performance breakdowns caused yips affected golfers to reinvest more conscious effort over performance, effectively causing repeated yips experiences. In my anecdotal but observed experience with players afflicted with the yips, it seems that one very bad outing can stick in a player‚Äôs mind longer than it should, creating a vicious cycle. Whether or not an athlete has the ability to shake off the experience could be rooted in their individual personality type.
What might cause an athlete to feel anxiety or fear toward a movement they‚Äôve been doing their whole life? Research to date suggests that certain personality characteristics might increase susceptibility (Taylor, 2014). Perfectionism, for example, is considered to be a consistent predictor of anxiety across a range of populations (Frost & Henderson, 1991; Hall,1998). It has also been predicted that individuals with perfectionistic tendencies experience higher levels of anxiety following a perceived setback or mistake, due to an internal need for achievement. Consequently, perfectionism has received widespread attention throughout both sport and non-sport psychology literature (Flett, 2008; Frost, 2002; Stoeber & Otto, 2006).
‚ÄúIndividuals with perfectionistic tendencies experience higher levels of anxiety following a perceived setback or mistake.‚Äù
Stoeber and Otto (2006) also noted healthy and unhealthy profiles of perfectionism. The unhealthy involve high levels of both perfectionistic striving and perfectionistic concern, consequently increasing vulnerability to performance breakdown. Stoeber and Otto extended their findings off The Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS; Frost , 1990). The FMPS model still remains the most widely accepted model of perfectionism in sports. Together, perfectionistic striving and perfectionistic concern often reveal high correlations with negative outcomes such as depression, neuroticism, maladaptive coping, and negative affect (Stoeber & Otto, 2006).
Several studies have also reported that individuals affected by Type I yips invest considerable time and cognitive resources engaging in obsessive thinking about the experience, specifically focusing on the negative outcomes and potential causes (Bawden, 2001; Rotheram, 2007).
‚ÄúIndividuals affected by Type I yips invest considerable time engaging in obsessive thinking about the experience, specifically focusing on the negative outcomes and potential causes.‚Äù
Recent research has demonstrated that individuals experiencing Type I yips / LMS obsess over the problem in a highly self-critical manner. Furthermore, they also appear to display high-levels of self-focused awareness, specifically attending to physical sensations, thoughts, and emotions associated with the affected skill (Bennett, 2016). Research has also reported links between focal dystonia and self-conscious reinvestment (Grattan, 2001).
Despite perfectionism having both positive and negative components, perfectionism, coupled with self-criticism, is seen as maladaptive for sports performers, with negative self-defeating outcomes on behavior such as depression, body image dissatisfaction, and avoidance behavior reported among extreme perfectionists (Flett & Hewitt, 2008). Given the major factors associated with Type I yips / LMS (e.g. anxiety, intrusive negative thoughts, obsessive thinking), it can be assumed unhealthy perfectionism might well be an antecedent of these problems and could also exacerbate responses to both. Specifically, perfectionism might cause individuals to negatively appraise an experience of yips, doubt their ability, and invest increased conscious effort to regain control over the movement. In turn disrupting the automaticity with which the movement was originally executed.
Not exactly. This is why telling a player to fine focus and lock eyes with a small piece of the strikezone or catcher doesn‚Äôt help command for many pitchers. Evidence shows a difference between novices and experts in precision is not per se related to an ability like concentration (Doppelmayr, 2008).
Another way to think about it is shown by a riflemen study that took EEG data while shooting repeatedly at a target. The study discussed that novices focus their attention on the target for significantly more time before a shot, whereas experts use a more precise timing of focus only increasing their attention to the target at the last possible moment before trigger pull (Doppelmayr, 2008).¬† The experts in Doppelmayr‚Äôs study relate to this gif, as you notice, Greg Maddux, known for his elite control, does not stare down the catchers mitt the whole time before and during his delivery.
If you‚Äôve made it this far, let‚Äôs enjoy a few more moments of Maddux‚Äôs greatness:
[Editor‚Äôs note: this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that elite command doesn‚Äôt involve elite repeatability and movement pattern precision, or that elite athletes aren‚Äôt paying attention to what they‚Äôre doing ‚Äì just that fine focusing and straining one‚Äôs attention intently on a specific target is probably not the overarching solution to ingraining highly repeatable mechanics]
Another elite command pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, discussing his approach to throwing the ball where he wants. Clayton is a guy who appears to keep his eye on the target (most pitches), so it‚Äôs interesting that he still doesn‚Äôt obsess or fine focus on the exact spot ‚Äì but rather trusts the repeatability of his patterns and tries to throw as hard as he can within those patterns.
So if it‚Äôs not from focusing harder on where they want to throw the ball, where does that repeatability come from?
I would argue it comes from tens of thousands of well intentioned repetitions (Malcolm Gladwell and other researchers refer to this as ‚Äúdeliberate practice‚Äù), which ingrain the motor patterns, as well as sufficient experience in the competitive environment to be able to trust and perform these automatic patterns even under pressure and stress. Although no motor pattern will ever be exactly identical to a previous pattern (Bernstein‚Äôs Degrees of Freedom Problem states that ‚Äúmovement kinematics are not identical even when performing the same motion repeatedly; natural variation in position,¬†velocity, and¬†acceleration¬†of the¬†limb occur even during seemingly identical movements‚Äù), the error margin can still be reduced through meticulous practice.
One study, (Kim 2008) examined mental rehearsals in elite vs. rookie archers. Rookie and elite archers were asked to mentally rehearse their performances while inside a functional magnetic resonance machine (MRI). What was found was that the brains of the elite archers were more efficient, meaning that less of the elite archers‚Äô brains were active at a single moment in time compared with the rookie archers. Novice archers were predominately active in the frontal cortex, which contains the prefrontal cortex and is responsible for regulating emotions. The experts did not show any activity in the frontal lobe. The frontal cortex stands out and shows why the experts in the experiment, with advanced experience, long-term practice, coordination, and emotional regulation results in less cortical activity when challenged with task demands.  This further supports the assertion that anxiety and a critical internal focus only make the yips worse. It would likely take 10,000 more shots before the brains of the rookie archers behaved more like the elite (Brager, 2015).
Here is a helpful graphic illustrating the process of skill acquisition from novice to expert ‚Äì from unconscious incompetence to ultimately performing the skill automatically with a high degree of repeatability (unconscious competence):
Michael Jordan demonstrating unconscious competence ‚Äì tens of thousands of repetitions make certain movements automatic with a high degree of precision.
Another noted aspect of yips studies is that the methodological quality evaluated on the The McMaster Critical Review Form found when a systematic review on the yips was done, there was almost no formal evidence to support that there are effective interventions for the yips (Mine & Ono, 2018). As shown in graph below:
Unfortunately, not many treatments for the yips have worked. To date, no single systematic review has been produced with regard to effective management for the yips in baseball. Many remedies for the yips that focus specifically on coordination of self thoughts including the usual meditation and ‚Äúmind clearing‚Äù mental rehearsals. One study done with golfers by Domna Banakou of the University of Barcelona Spain (Banakou, 2010) suggested that to make the ‚Äòdream‚Äô a reality players mentally create a golf avatar of themselves with great putting ability.
Another suggested solution to the yips has been the use of botulinum toxin, similar to botox injections for wrinkles. Botox has been shown to help certain golfers with a physical disorder such as task-specific dystonia to remedy the co-contractions (Adler, 2005). This research may be good for golfers, but is unlikely to apply to baseball players as it has been shown botox treatments weaken the surrounding muscles, despite remedying erratic inhibition of muscles. Golf putting relies less on strength and power and more on a controlled repeatable movement. Throwing a baseball however does rely on strength and power not only to project the ball at a high velocity, but to also protect the ligaments in the arm. A baseball player would not be able to use this as a long term treatment, as the forearm and shoulder muscles play too major of a role in injury prevention and performance.
Rick Ankiel had a short term fix of his own: Vodka. He was quoted in an interview recounting the story:
Despite lackluster research on yips treatments to date, an Australian Football League kicking program addressed a professional team sport that relies on the accuracy of accurate kicks. Accuracy kicking is one of the most challenging skills to learn. Even the most elite professionals only hit their targets 80% of the time. The complexity and specification for kicking in the AFL draws similar comparisons to throwing a baseball, as both are power dominated sports that require incredible amounts of proprioception.¬†Mark Williams brainstormed a new type of football and protocol to develop accurate kicks, with the backing of Sherrin, official ball maker of the AFL. The program is called the Sherrin Precision concept and it relies on both physical cues and mental cues to develop the accuracy needed. The ball physically differs slightly from the typical AFL ball as it has a larger sweet spot on each side of the ball, and is marked with a yellow line down the through the middle to give the player feedback on the spin line of their kicks.
The program brings the athlete through a progression of phases starting with basic kicking and developing into more complex tasks as each athlete completes the subsequent phase. While not studied or published in an academic journal, this program seems to be worthy of further investigation to see what can be extracted for a baseball pitcher.
The program works with helping elite players develop accuracy by relying on immediate feedback with the spin line, as well as mental feedback. Beginner advice includes feedback like making the ball rotate as much as possible, an external cue. Elite level kicking has more specific instructions for developing a player‚Äôs feel that relies more on specific external cues such as hitting the ball on a particular spot on the foot. Interestingly, I have seen coaches (Ben with Tread is one of them) use similar techniques by drawing a spin line on baseballs with a sharpie. This build in external feedback to the throw, with the goal on fastballs to create a tight black line indicating true backspin during the flight path of the ball.
What struck me as most interesting was that the coaching phases and styles taught on here feed back to my own theories on how accuracy is developed. Much of the program furthers my conclusions that external cues help a player more so than internal cues. This is not to say mental coaching and internal cues have no place, but it likely shouldn‚Äôt be the main priority for players looking to develop accuracy or overcome the Yips.
Research about the yips can be used to improve ¬†a team‚Äôs entire pitching staff rather than just one individual. If you understand what makes a yipped player, you may be able to apply a few key principles towards improving command of the entire staff. The yips are acquired and are environmentally dependent. One environment that produces the yips is one where a player is not looking forward to practicing (Ikemoto, ‚Äô15). Conversely, extracellular dopamine is linked to higher levels of performance, and a feeling of euphoria.¬† Dopamine plays a large role in learning successful proprioceptive activities, Olympic athletes have been found to be more likely to have higher dopamine receptors than control groups of non-athletes (Filonzi, ‚Äô15).
Dopamine makes physical movement rewarding. Dopamine receptors are malleable and can be reshaped through physical movement. Dopamine is not the be all and end all when it comes to performance, but it plays a large role in the learning of movement. An athlete has to organize his brain to the task at hand and come up with a mental strategy of how to do it repeatedly.
Dealing with a gifted, highly driven athlete who demands perfection can be a double-edged sword for a coach. It is possible the player experiencing negative and self critical thoughts can be helped by a coach who understands this athlete. I believe a highly critical and negative environment focusing on the consequences of throwing balls or wild pitches is counterproductive to developing command or relieving the yips.¬† To be clear, this doesn‚Äôt just mean giving pitchers unlimited in game chances. Instead, explain the possible issues and ways to eliminate these negative thoughts, if that is the case for the athlete. Although this will not apply to every yipped up player, it can help a certain subgroup of yipped up players.
From the Milton study, we  know that while novices were just as focused on the task at hand as the expert golfers, the novices could not filter unnecessary stimuli and became preoccupied with details irrelevant hitting a golf ball. To further elaborate, a coach does not need to tell the player to focus on throwing strikes more, just helping the pitcher filter the unnecessary stimuli will actually lead to better results. For the golfers the unnecessary stimuli was asking questions like if there was wind, and how far away the hole was. For a pitcher it could be something like focusing on the last pitch, knowing someone is watching them in the crowd, or just being intimidated by the hitter thus throwing off the focus from executing the pitch.
Command needs to be taught the same way discipline and habits are taught. Think of command as a habit gained through consistent daily practice. A coach can create the right environment to guide the player who is trying to be better. A player with poor command likely focuses too much on not messing up, creating a self-perpetuating cycle. Focus on drills that do not discipline failure but instead reward success. The latter can be applied simply by giving the best pitcher in the drills, scrimmages or competitions each week some team gear or other incentive, rather than making everybody who loses run. If the focus of the drill is to not mess up, athletes will instinctively only attempt to avoid trouble. But if the focus is to win, an athlete will figure out a way to get that win.
If a player hates being at practice and has a negative coach or team environment, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect positive outcomes. If a coach‚Äôs style is based around punishing failure, ‚Äútough love‚Äù and yelling ‚Äì it might make sense to avoid recruiting pitchers who don‚Äôt fit into that system ‚Äì i.e. the perfectionists and other personality types we‚Äôve already discussed.
To improve command, a player‚Äôs energy should not be focused on being emotionally involved with thinking about mistakes or other bad practices. In other words, the extra 10 practice balls you threw because you did not like your performance likely does more harm than good, which is another reason it is important to track improvement over time. Don‚Äôt focus on week-to-week fluctuations while you are maintaining a regular schedule with a set amount of total throws. Self-conscious reinvestment was found to be a personality trait linked to focal dystonia (Bennett, 2016). Reinvestment can be summed up as those moments in practice where you keep saying ‚Äúone more‚Äù 20 extra times because you didn‚Äôt like the outcome of the last pitch.
Other personality traits include perfectionism and self-critical internal thinking, all of which were found higher in Yips/LMS subjects than control subjects. Perfectionism can be an admirable trait to have, but when a perfectionist is also highly self critical, he is distracted by unnecessary thoughts which make it more difficult to properly organize the nervous system to throw a strike.
So to summarize again; if you finish a bullpen and it‚Äôs a bad day, do not throw extra pitches as a way to ‚Äòfix‚Äô the bad performance. The caveat to this is that an extra 3-5 pitches is probably acceptable, depending on the reason why ‚Äî for instance, if you had a good feeling about the pitch before and wanted to try and repeat it.¬† The times you want to avoid are when you keep getting mad at yourself and go beyond your previously set limit out of anger/negative emotion. If you don‚Äôt have a great bullpen, just let yourself have a bad day and forget about it tomorrow. This is similar to how some artists step away from a project for a little while to focus better when they do return. Your brain will go to bed and naturally try to make your proprioception better. So don‚Äôt go to bed angry, instead what would help more is if you just say a prayer thanking (whoever) because you got to play another day of baseball and get back to work with a fresh day.
Baseball is a game of failure, and brushing off a pitch that wasn‚Äôt executed well is important to throwing the next ball with conviction. To avoid being rattled, many elite players develop a mental routine to clear their mind, focus in on the present and block out unnecessary emotions/stimuli. Remember, (Milton, 2007) was able to pick out novices from the elite 6/6 and 7/7 times respectively by examining basal ganglia/limbic activation through fMRI data. Milton went on to discuss that this is a function of the amateurs not being able to filter the irrelevant stimuli.
The mental routine you should take to be consistent is the one that works best for you, is clearly defined and is repeatable. As a suggestion, instead thinking about perfectly placing the ball, think about throwing with conviction and trusting your preparation. Furthermore, the mental routine should also include your physical pre-pitch routine ‚Äì how you toe the rubber, how you come set, and how you take the sign from the catcher are all physical anchors that will ground you in a more stable mental state. Once you have taken the sign from the catcher, a mental process might look like this:
Note: some pitchers do fine staring at the target the entire time ‚Äì but like Kershaw noted above, he still avoids allowing the location to take up the majority of real estate in his mind as he executes the pitch.
Don Cooper has his own version of this mental rehearsal, essentially focusing on the same nuts and bolts: intention, trust and flushing the result (good or bad):
To conclude, helping the yips affected player is a matter of getting the player to ‚Äúclear his mind‚Äù. There is no ‚Äúbest‚Äù solution. The yips are far from being understood because it is presently very difficult (but not impossible) to find out how the brain‚Äôs neuro-functions are working inside a player‚Äôs mind. That does not mean we must be completely pessimistic about solving an individual‚Äôs yips. Yes, yips might be a daunting task you have come to believe you cannot overcome and might even get worse. However a study at Kyushu University, Japan, examined players who overcame the yips and grew from the experience. The research surveyed 416 university level baseball players who either had the yips, overcame the yips, or never experienced them. Using the ‚ÄúPsychological Maturity as an Athlete Scale‚Äù, the group that overcame obtained higher scores in self-understanding, had greater focus on independent achievements and goals, rather than focusing on teammates, and gained a clearer understanding of what baseball means to them. Some baseball players have overcome the yips completely on their own and gone on to successful baseball careers (Matsuda, 2018).
It‚Äôs important to remember that players have overcome struggles with the yips by themselves and continued to play baseball.
The primary purpose of this article was to systematically review the psychological, neurological and physiological parameters of the yips along with the impact the yips have on performance. After exploring the causes of the yips, together with the way it manifests itself in an athlete‚Äôs mind, I believe it is possible to extrapolate research from other sports to understanding the yips in baseball. I defined the yips as a form of task specific focal dystonia that results from a shift from external to internal thinking, leading to the breakdown of the basal ganglia and the functions controlling proprioception. Despite the yips being considered an individually inflicted issue, where the player is mentally weak and unable to handle pressure, I conclude the yips are much more a product of a player‚Äôs environment than previously thought.
I am currently doing research using EEG sensors to look for evidence of neurological differences between players with and without the yips. My initial focus will be mapping whether different types of throws produce neurological differences. For example, throwing with eyes open versus eyes closed will be one of the first experiments. My goal is to find and connect differences in neurological activity to different levels of player control.
I will be doing this research with¬†Bobby Tewksbary in Nashua, New Hampshire, and I am excited about where this research may lead. By looking for conclusive data into where the yips comes from I am hoping to unravel clues as to how to fix the issue ‚Äî or at least find better ways of preventing it.
YIPS:¬†A physiological and neurological breakdown inside the mind of an athlete. In baseball this looks like a thrower not coming close to a target.
TYPE I YIPS:¬†Neurologically Based
TYPE II YIPS:¬†Psychologically based form of ‚Äúchoking‚Äù
FOCAL DYSTONIA:¬†When muscles cannot perform a task manifesting itself with locking limbs. Seen in golfers, writers, musicians.
BASAL GANGLIA:¬†A group of structures in the cerebral hemispheres including the brainstem (part of brain attached to spinal cord). While nonmotor functions are also associated, the structures are best known for their role in movement. The role in movement is to influence activity in other areas of the brain.
MUSCLE INHIBITION:¬†When the muscle is activated, also known as the muscle reflex, and a relaxation of an antagonist muscle. Seen often during a dynamic stretching warmup where one muscle is activated while another is stretched.

Is Playing Video Games Linked to Arm Pain?,2019-03-13T16:39:31+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/is-playing-video-games-linked-to-arm-pain/,"Today‚Äôs article comes to you from Garrison Roy. Currently, Roy is a pitching coach for the Limestone College Saints. Having experience as a player (Southeastern Community College and Winston-Salem State University)  and also time as an instructor (spending one year as a pitching instructor and strength and conditioning coach at the Florida Baseball Ranch), Roy brings great insight as he‚Äôs had the opportunity to work with athletes ranging from little leaguers to professional players. He can be reached by his twitter¬†or through¬†his website. This article was originally published on his blog and can be viewed there as well.)
Are video games linked to arm pain? At least one new study has suggested that they are.
I recently tweeted about this particular study that was posted in the Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (JSES). Link to the abstract of this study¬†HERE.
The authors concluded that
‚ÄúPlaying video games for ‚â•3 hours/day was associated with elbow or shoulder pain among elite young male baseball players.‚Äù
Some have taken this research to an extreme degree and interpreted it as saying that playing video games will lead to arm pain, but in my opinion, to say that video games CAUSE arm pain is a far stretch.
When looking at research, it‚Äôs important to note that there is a difference between correlation/association and causation.¬†When researchers find a¬†correlation, which can also be called an association, what they are saying is that they found¬†a relationship between two or more variables. For example, if the number of sales of sunscreen goes up so do the sales in sunglasses.
Causation¬†is a step further than that and also referred to as cause and effect. In the example above, the cause of the sales of sunscreen and sunglasses increasing is actually the weather or temperature rise.
So to revisit the study released on video games, do video games CAUSE the elbow and shoulder pain? Unlikely. Is it associated? YES. The sedentary lifestyle, the hunched back posture, the potential for forearm/flexor fatigue  and an increased probability of sleep deprivation in combination are all factors that may explain the increase in arm pain.
To their credit the study mentioned above did mention in their conclusion:
These findings highlight the effect of lifestyle on elbow and shoulder pain and should be taken into consideration by players, coaches, parents and clinicians.
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Your lifestyle plays a huge factor in your performance. It‚Äôs deeper than what you do in practice or in an hour training session.
A¬†hypothesis¬†would be that the longer time spent playing video games adversely affects the amount of time moving and staying active. Which means, in the case of training and refining skill, less time improving your game! In addition to that, the poor kyphotic posture and potential for forearm flexor fatigue could be an influence in the shoulder and elbow pain (we already know from research that pitching through fatigue has a massive association with risk of arm injury).
To the Parents:¬†No need to take this to the extreme and ground your kids from video games. Just monitoring their time and minimizing binge playing and sleep deprivation would be a step in the right direction.
To the Players:¬†I get it. You‚Äôre gonna keep playing. You might even binge on a rainy day where you can‚Äôt do much outside. It‚Äôs a way to virtually hang out with your buddies.
But what if you could optimize the time in-between¬†games¬†to offset the effects of complete sedentary behavior?
Every time you die in a game try one of these:
To offset the decrease in hip extension and range of motion from prolonged sitting:
To get the shoulders and upper back moving to escape the slumped, rounded posture from prolonged sitting:
Make it fun!¬†You could even make it a competition between your friends (i.e. Number of deaths you have = amount of push-ups)
In conclusion, video games probably won‚Äôt directly give you arm pain, but be careful to not fall into the common lifestyle traps of those who do play video games daily. Further investigation might be needed‚Ä¶
Keep Moving!

How to Sync the Arm into the Plane of Shoulder Rotation,2019-03-07T19:48:02+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/plane-of-rotation/,"Efficient pitching mechanics combine and utilize multiple planes of motion. This isn‚Äôt a particularly controversial statement ‚Äì but let‚Äôs break it down further.
There‚Äôs the linear/lateral phase of the throw ‚Äì the drive or ‚Äúflatbed truck‚Äù as Paul Nyman referred to it. This feeds into the rotational phase of the throw, which can be further divided into two parts: east-west rotation (pure transverse plane) and north-south rotation (combination of frontal /transverse plane). Randy Johnson is a classic example of this east-west rotation, while Andy Pettitte is a good example of north-south rotation.
Nyman referred to the east-west component as the ‚Äúmerry-go-round‚Äù and the north-south component as the ‚Äúferris wheel.‚Äù
This is a useful, if somewhat comical, way to examine a high level delivery:
Very few elite throwers completely rely on only one of these pieces ‚Äì as it‚Äôs being able to seamlessly stitch together this energy from all planes that allows a pitcher to create maximum ball velocities.
This concept is a big reason why a guy like Andrew Owen was able to experience such a velocity bump (from upper 80‚Äôs/low 90s to sitting 94-96 and getting signed by the Cardinals) ‚Äì we took him from rotating purely in the transverse plane and added some ‚Äúflatbed‚Äù (utilizing the rear leg drive more) and ‚Äúferris wheel‚Äù (adding some shoulder tilt) to his delivery.
While this tri-planar concept is important, it isn‚Äôt enough, because it doesn‚Äôt take into account the arm. Maximum efficiency won‚Äôt be possible ‚Äì even with a perfect flatbed truck, merry-go-round and ferris wheel ‚Äì if the arm (and ball) don‚Äôt find their way into that plane of shoulder rotation from the start and stay there through ball release.
‚ÄúMaximum efficiency won‚Äôt be possible if the arm (and ball) don‚Äôt find their way into the plane of shoulder rotation.‚Äù
Here are a couple images showing this happening properly, in two undersized 100+ mph hurlers.
The throwing elbow is in line with the rear shoulder when rotation begins, the arm lays back fully into this plane, and the shoulders/torso rotate around the spine. This visual from SETPRO, which I have posted frequently in the past, illustrates the plane, and shows the arm syncing into this plane during shoulder rotation:
Okay, this all makes sense in theory ‚Äì but from a practical standpoint, what does it look like when the arm is out of plane?
The arm can come out of plane at the beginning of shoulder rotation or at the end. When the arm is out of plane at the start of shoulder rotation, most of the time we‚Äôre going to be talking about a low elbow, also known as arm ‚Äúdrag‚Äù or ‚Äúlag.‚Äù In biomechanical terms, the degree of shoulder abduction at landing should be 90 degrees (elbow in line with the shoulders).
With the arm lagging, shoulder rotation begins, but the arm is still way down below that plane. Here are two athletes showing this issue. Both were throwing 3-5 mph below what I would have ‚Äúpredicted‚Äù given their sizes, strength numbers, etc. This gives you an idea of how much of a problem this can be for velocity production:
Even if the arm catches back up 2 or 3 frames later (as it does in both of these pitchers), there was still a significant loss of energy transfer during the acceleration phase of the throw.
This is the most common form of not keeping the arm in the plane of shoulder rotation, and it happens at the end of the throw. As shoulder rotation occurs, one of two things can happen. First, many lower level throwers cut off their rotation as they near ball release, forward flexing the trunk to finish the throw.
‚ÄúMany lower level throwers cut off their rotation as they near ball release, forward flexing the trunk to finish the throw.‚Äù
This attempt to transfer rotational energy into a linear finish via the trunk is a major inefficiency, and one that can be blamed on the torso, not the arm. As the torso flexes forward (typically a well-intentioned attempt to ‚Äúthrow strikes‚Äù or get behind the ball), the arm also comes out of plane, finishing (pushing) straight down to the glove side hip, something I discussed here.
You can watch yours truly (back in high school), exhibiting this velocity killer. The black line is the angle of my shoulders, but rather than rotating in plane, I‚Äôm forward flexing into release.
Contrast this to rotating through your arm slot, in all three of these examples that I‚Äôve talked about before:
The second outcome is that shoulder rotation actually continues, but the arm takes itself out of that rotational path to finish linearly towards the target. In this case, the torso is doing its job ‚Äì but the arm is hijacking the rotation. This isn‚Äôt as big of a velocity killer as forward flexing the trunk (this HS pitcher below has still been up to 94 mph), but it‚Äôs still represents the arm not staying maximally synced in the rotational plane through ball release.
It‚Äôs worth noting that this particular pitcher does a lot right. This is about the only flaw I could pinpoint in his delivery. Speaking of which, look at that back foot position ‚Äì the externally rotated foot/hip can really help guys maintain contact with the back leg if it works for their hip anatomy. But I digress.
For comparison, here‚Äôs an almost identical delivery, minus the rotational flaw at ball release. A 97 mph fastball from Brandon Morrow, ladies and gentlemen:
Regardless, of the culprit (torso or arm), the underlying cause of these symptoms tends to be the same: focusing on throwing strikes, not being wild, etc.
‚ÄúThe underlying cause of these symptoms tends to be the same: focusing on throwing strikes, not being wild, etc.‚Äù
This is fairly easy to notice if you look at the shoulder angle (contralateral tilt in biomechanical terms), corresponding arm slot (the two should match), and then follow those two angles through ball release. The arm slot should continue to follow through in the plane of shoulder rotation, not push down through the target, finishing on the opposite hip.
Note: the arm will eventually complete its natural deceleration arc and wind up near the opposite hip ‚Äì that‚Äôs not my point. My point is that you can glean a lot of information based on where the arm goes in the several frames after ball release. Rotating properly will continue to send the arm on a deceleration path through the arm slot, ultimately ending up near the opposite hip.
Here‚Äôs a video demonstrating that distinction from Freeman Baseball, using Pedro Martinez.
What‚Äôs interesting is that many of these athletes can rotate fine when you put them in a long
toss situation or have them test plyos into a wall or baseballs into a net.
It‚Äôs simply a context-based mechanical flaw.
While I don‚Äôt have a cure-all, here are some things to avoid
that definitely can cause this issue to creep up.
Pitching scared or trying to be ‚Äútoo fine‚Äù can lead to avoiding the rotational violence necessary to maximize the velocity side of the equation. Athletes should be in attack mode, not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid to walk this batter‚Äù mode. As a coach, encourage that, don‚Äôt freak out and throw the clipboard every time a pitcher gets to a 2-0 count (yes, this actually happens). Even if the in-game pitcher doesn‚Äôt see it, the rest of the staff does, and that will be in the back of their minds the next time they‚Äôre in the game. Motivation to avoid failure vs. motivation to achieve success is relevant here.
I‚Äôm not saying for pitchers to yank the head, grunt, and throw the ball over the backstop every pitch. But there must be sufficient intensity (and the confidence to maintain that intensity) that the body doesn‚Äôt put the brakes on that rotation heading into release for fear (subconscious or otherwise) that they won‚Äôt be able to throw a strike.
‚ÄúThere must be sufficient intensity (and the confidence to maintain that intensity) that the body doesn‚Äôt put the brakes on that rotation heading into release for fear (subconscious or otherwise) that they won‚Äôt be able to throw a strike.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs Clayton Kershaw, on his mentality to throwing strikes. Counterintuitively, it‚Äôs not based on trying to throw strikes. The majority of the real-estate in his brain is focused on throwing the pitch as hard as he can, while the back of his mind understands the target he‚Äôs going for. This approach works for him because he has such a repeatable delivery, and he has ingrained his motion over thousands of reps. Getting to this point where your mechanics are second nature (aided by a strong pre-pitch routine) will allow pitchers to trust this approach to strike throwing.
Long toss is unique in that it encourages throws to be on-line, while also encouraging a high intensity, rotational finish to reach max distances. Immediate ‚Äúcommand‚Äù feedback is there if the ball sails way off line, and it‚Äôs also there in the form of seeing how far the throw went (‚Äúvelocity feedback‚Äù). In essence, you can work on the rotational aspect of the throw without sacrificing keeping the delivery on line (properly directing rotation and intent through the target).
‚ÄúLong toss is unique in that it encourages throws to be on-line, while also encouraging a high intensity, rotational finish to reach max distances.‚Äù
Note: if you‚Äôre dealing with a low elbow guy, long tossing on an arc can make the problem worse. I‚Äôve had success with low elbow guys focusing on getting the elbow up and driving balls down and on a line. They‚Äôll still get the immediate feedback and benefits of long toss, even if they aren‚Äôt throwing to maximum distance.
If an athlete finishes well, but has a low elbow/arm lag, one cue that can help is the cue of being patient with the torso rotation. In other words, let the arm spiral its way up before beginning to yank the torso through. I‚Äôll use the spiral staircase analogy ‚Äì rather than waiting until the arm is halfway up the staircase and dragging the elbow up through the ceiling (and then down the hallway), wait until the arm gets to the top of the staircase and drive down through the hallway.
Here‚Äôs what firing the arm up through the ceiling looks like:
He finally gets the arm in plane and then tries to redirect that force down the ‚Äúhallway‚Äù:
Herrera lets the arm spiral up to the top of the staircase (elbow in line with the angle of the shoulders) before shoulder rotation begins, so everything is driving down and through the ball from the first instant of shoulder rotation.
This is a tough habit to break, so consider backing up into various constraint drills that cue the desired pattern ‚Äì driving down through the ball and being patient with the torso rotation until the elbow climbs to shoulder height. Here‚Äôs that same athlete below:
If an athlete can do it in certain drill-work or scenarios, but not in others, then you need to establish which variable creates the disconnect.
Can he rotate effectively and keep the arm in plane during the crow hop but not the delivery? Try long tossing out of the pitcher‚Äôs delivery to work on that.
Is it flat ground to the mound where the breakdown happens? Try blending long toss throws with mound throws and add in mound plyos.
Is it only when a batter steps in? Practice intent bullpens with stand-in hitters. Start at 57-58 feet and work back to standard distance from there once it becomes comfortable.
Is it only when a catcher sets up a small spot to hit and the coach is watching? Making too small of a target can mess with repeatability, especially if there is a motivation to avoid failure present. Try cueing throwing through the center of the catcher, rather than to the mitt, knee, or a specific quadrant of the strikezone. Always trying to blast the center of the catcher ‚Äì regardless of where he sets up in the strikezone, can flip on that light switch in the brain and avoid the being too fine syndrome. Short bullpens from 57-58 feet can help too.
When the athlete understands the issue and knows what exactly they‚Äôre trying to achieve, it makes your job as a coach easier. Keep it simple. Let the arm climb to shoulder height before beginning rotation. Rotate violently ‚Äì but direct that rotation through the target ‚Äì and don‚Äôt ease off the gas pedal into release.
When in doubt, find a mechanical model specific to the athlete in question, and put up a side-by-side for them to see what you‚Äôre talking about. It will take the abstract and make it very, very concrete.
We made a video that might help clarify things a bit further, so make sure to check it out below. Please share this post if you found it helpful and let me know your thoughts on twitter or at [email¬†protected]

Do Different Arm Slots = Different Mechanics?,2019-02-26T21:08:39+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/arm-slot-differences/,"Today‚Äôs article comes to you from Graeme Lehman (MSc, CSCS). Graeme has extensive practical and academic experience in the field of baseball strength and conditioning. You may remember him from his guest post on grunting and velocity, or from his Master‚Äôs Thesis on how various lower-body field tests correlate with throwing velocity. He can be reached by email¬†or through¬†his website. This article was originally published on his blog and can be viewed there as well.
Categorizing pitchers based on their arm slot is easy.¬† You can see it with your naked eye and the language within baseball already exists.
But is arm slot the only mechanical difference between these types of deliveries?¬† And if they are different doesn‚Äôt this mean that we as coaches should have some cues and training methods that vary across the arm slot spectrum?
These are the questions that I am interested in and I am going to do my best to answer the first question of mechanical differences with some information from some recent research.¬† This type of knowledge is useful because when we do go and categorize pitchers based off of their arm slot it will provide a deeper base of knowledge.
‚ÄúCategorization is the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated, and understood. [The primary task of categorization is] to provide maximum information with the least cognitive effort.‚Äù-Rosch, 1978. Principles of Categorization
I am all about this quote, especially that last part about the most information with the least effort.¬† This might be the new motto that I use when trying to write an article.
Here‚Äôs the research paper that I am using for this article:
Differences Among Overhead, 3-Quarter, and Sidearm Pitching Biomechanics in Professional Baseball Players (Escamilla & Fleisig ‚Äì 2018)
I highly suggest you take a look at it because their main findings of which arm slot is at a higher risk for sustaining either a UCL or SLAP tear is interesting and very important.
What I am going to do is look at differences between these arm slots:
When it comes to vital aspects of pitching mechanics that relate to producing velocity like:
**They didn‚Äôt include any pitchers that threw with arm angles that were in the 40-50 & 60-70 degree range in order to make the distinctions more clear cut**
***Editor‚Äôs side note: the velocity across all groups was ~38 m/s or ~85 mph, which is reasonably advanced as far as studies go for pitchers, but especially advanced for sidearm pitchers. It‚Äôs possible we‚Äôre looking at very elite sidearmers, and relatively average 3/4 or overhead pitchers. This doesn‚Äôt discredit the study, but it‚Äôs an observation that may impact how we interpret the following results.***
Before we get into the small variations between the mechanics of pitchers with different arm slots at these critical points let‚Äôs look at the¬†obvious differences.¬† Shoulder abduction and contralateral tilt are two factors that play the biggest role in determining where that arm is in relation to the body.
One trait that separated all three groups from each other is the amount of shoulder abduction at ball release.¬† All three groups had fairly similar angles of abduction when the front foot first hit the ground (89-OH, 89-3/4, 84-SA) but by the time the ball was being released the difference were significant.¬† The OH group ended up with the most at 94 degrees while the ¬æ group stayed nearly the same while the Sidearm group dropped their elbow slightly down to 81 degrees.
This is in-line with other research that states that in order to produce the most power the shoulder needs to be in and around the 90-degree mark of shoulder abduction since this is the strongest angle.
The biggest contributing factor to arm slot is the amount of contralateral tilt.¬† In the past, I‚Äôve written about contralateral tilt¬†here¬†and¬†here.¬† Its basically describes how far your upper body is tilting to the side in order to allow your arm to be in its desired arm slot while staying near that magic 90-degree mark.¬† The contralateral tilt for this skinny guy below is the difference between his sternum (aka breast bone) and the vertical line labeled ‚ÄúZ‚Äù
The numbers for this group were as follows
These are significantly different from one another but again was obvious.¬† Although it is nice to put some hard numbers to these traits in order to add some depth to our categorization system.
Now that we got that out of the way with let‚Äôs dig into the smaller differences so that we can add more intel into our already existing categorization scheme.
I picked these parameters based on other research like¬†this¬†which I wrote about¬†here.
This study did not tell us how much hip an shoulder separation occurred but one thing that I found to be interesting was the timing between peak pelvic and shoulder rotations.¬† Each group displayed a delay and separation between the hip‚Äôs and shoulder‚Äôs each reaching top rotational speeds towards home plate but the timing was different for each arm slot.
The really cool and high tech graphic below is a visual representation of the timing between the hips (triangles) and the shoulders (lightning bolts) and when they reached their peak velocity in the delivery.¬† The timing values that we see are in the form of a percentage between 0%, the point when your front foot hits the ground, and 100%, when the ball is released.
One might think that the group who reached peak rotation of the hips the soonest would also be the first group to have their shoulders reach top speed.¬† That is not the case.
The sidearm group in yellow rotated their hips later but their shoulders sooner while the Overhead group had the biggest amount of time between these two events.¬† When we look at exactly how fast the hips are rotating in degrees per second the sidearm group was significantly faster than either of the other two arm slot groups.¬† Maybe this groups uses the added time to build up more hip rotation velocity?¬† Maybe they rely more on a ‚Äúrotational‚Äù type of delivery versus a linear??¬† These are just some of the many follow up questions that happen every time I learn something new.
It should be noted that the Sidearm group also landed with their foot in a closed position which means that their hips didn‚Äôt have to rotate as much.¬† We don‚Äôt know exactly how much rotation is occurring since it isn‚Äôt reported but we can make this assumption.
Another interesting point is that the Overhead group reached their peak hip rotation the earliest while their shoulders reached their peaked the latest.¬† This, in essence, would provide more time to create hip and shoulder separation.¬† More time can lead to the POTENTIAL of creating more force but not always.
Another key piece of information is that the Sidearm group has significantly more external rotation at the shoulder joint than either of the other two arm slots.¬† The Sidearm throwers average 169 degrees of external rotation whereas the Overhead and 3/4‚Äôs displayed 162 & 163 degrees respectively.
More ER allows for added time to have force applied to the baseball which is good but some pitchers may be able to reach elite levels by internally rotating faster with less ER.¬†¬†This is tough to coach but its still good info.
‚ÄúMore ER allows for added time to have force applied to the baseball‚Ä¶but some pitchers may be able to reach elite levels by internally rotating faster with less ER.‚Äù
It should be noted that upper back mobility (t-spine) as well as scapular posterior tilt can add to that overall ‚Äúlay back‚Äù position of the forearm ‚Äì it‚Äôs not all external rotation at the glenohumeral joint.¬† Maybe the other two arm slots allow for more T-spine extension and rotation which make up for the lack ER at the shoulder.
The action of the front leg is vital.¬†¬†Harder throwers extend their front leg between the time that the front foot hits the ground to the time when the ball is released.¬† Or at least stays the same angle.
All three groups displayed this critical mechanical principal in varying degrees.¬†¬†The Sidearm pitchers landed at front foot contact (FFC) taller with the leg being the straightest at 39 degrees but only extended a little bit to 37 degrees at ball release (BR).¬† ¬†This isn‚Äôt a lot of movement and would look more like landing on a stiff leg.¬† The ¬æ‚Äôs group had the greatest amount of extension with 8 degrees going from 43 at FFC to 35 at BR.¬† The overhead group displays the most amount of knee bend at FFC (44) upon landing and extends to 39 degrees.¬† Keep in mind that the front leg will keep extending after the ball is release which gives these kinds of images of pitchers really getting aggressive with that front leg so that they can catapult baseballs out of their hands at incredible speeds. Like we see here with Otani.
The information that we get about the back leg is minimal.¬† No force plates were used to see how much energy is being produced and when it‚Äôs being applied and in which direction.
We do get the max height of their front knee when they pick that leg up during the windup which can tell us a bit about how they are using their bag leg.¬† We also get to see how much ‚Äúpelvic drift‚Äù occurs when they are at max knee height.¬† This term ‚Äúpelvic drift‚Äù in this case is how much the front hip is leading towards home plate.
What we see is that the Sidearm group is significantly different than the 3/4 and Overhead groups who were almost identical to one another.
The sidearm group of pitchers didn‚Äôt lift their knee as high but lead with their hips more than the other groups.
‚ÄúThe sidearm group of pitchers didn‚Äôt lift their knee as high but lead with their hips more than the other groups.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs a famous sidearmer displaying some ‚Äúpelvic hip drift‚Äù.¬† His knee lift looks high but when you look at it relative to his standing height, like they did in this study, its pretty low.
It‚Äôs a far stretch but you could try to build an idea in your head about how a pitcher uses their back leg with these pieces of information.¬† Lifting your front knee higher does give you more opportunity to apply force into the ground since the left leg (for righties) has more time and distance to build up speed as it comes back down towards the ground helping to add to the overall amount of force going into the ground.¬† The more you put in the more you can get out ‚Äì in theory.¬† But it works for jumping with aggressive arm actions downwards prior to take-off.¬† Just watch the NFL combine this year and you will see crazy arms actions prior to take-off in both the vertical and broad jumps.
I remember hearing a story that Nolan Ryan simply told Tom House to¬†‚Äúput that into your computer‚Äù when described how he felt about the relationship of lifting his leg higher and throwing harder.
The info about the amount of hip drift can be massaged into getting an idea about the direction that they are applying force into the ground.
We know that we need to get force back from the earth going in the direction of where you want to throw the ball.¬† But if our lead hip has been pushed out front we‚Äôve created the opportunity push into the ground with your back leg in a bit more of a horizontal angle rather than pushing straight down into the ground like you would when testing your vertical jump.
Teaching someone about to maximize the exchange of energy between how much we put into the ground and how we get back is vital.¬† Its easier to explain with something simple like the vertical jump since the energy is being exchanged in opposite directions.¬† One of the many, many reasons that pitching is complicated is that you have to master exchanging this energy going in different directions.¬† We have to go from applying force into the ground vertically and getting it back horizontally towards home plate.¬† The degree of just how vertically we are applying force into the ground can vary from pitchers to pitcher.¬† If we look at the guys in the previous two pictures, who happen to be number 1 and 2 in all-time strikeout in the MLB, we can see that Mr. Johnson is must be applying force into the ground more horizontally than Mr. Ryan.¬† Here‚Äôs another high tech graph to show you what I mean.
Here we see how they have both altered the shin angle of the back leg during this exchange of putting energy into the ground and then getting as much of it as we can, in a controlled yet powerful manner, back towards our target.
Just to clarify, I am stretching this information that I‚Äôm getting from a real study into these ideas.¬† But I think that they make a little bit of sense otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have spent so much time writing about them.¬† Sounds like something that I need to explore and elaborate on more in a future article.
The amount of forward trunk tilt at ball release is another biomechanical point that has been shown to correlate with velocity.¬†¬†This study¬†had the ‚Äúfast throwers‚Äù with trunk tilt of 36 degrees while the ‚Äúslow thrower‚Äù was more upright at 28 degrees.¬† All three of the various arm slot group were within this range.
This piece of information is interesting as well.¬† Not only does forward trunk tilt provide an advantage from an effective velocity point of view since the release point is closer to home plate.¬† We can also think of forward trunk tilt as providing more time to create more power as well.
There will obviously be variations within each arm slot itself and some of this information might not apply to every pitcher.¬† The aim here was to at the very least add this information into an already existing categorization scheme of pitchers based on their arm slot.¬† The goal would then be to take this information and formulate ideas of how we should adjust our training and coaching to these athletes with different approaches to a common goal of throwing hard, safe and accurate.
That‚Äôs the tough part but I hope this is a step in the right direction.

All About Tempo: Is It A Key To Unlocking Velocity?,2019-02-20T16:29:14+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/tempo/,"Tempo is an interesting topic that is most often heard in reference to holding runners. We¬†need¬†to¬†get¬†you¬†to¬†a¬†1.3 to the plate,¬†Johnny!¬†While there is undoubtedly value to being able to hold runners, I‚Äôd like to discuss tempo in a different context ‚Äì how it relates to efficient, high velocity mechanics. It‚Äôs my perspective that tempo can be a valuable (and easily quantifiable) piece of the high velocity puzzle. But what is tempo? How do we quantify it? How do you compare to the best pitchers in the world? And is a faster/slower tempo always better?
Patience, young Padawan. I‚Äôll get to all of these questions in this post.
Tempo refers to the overall rate at which a pitcher moves through his mechanics ‚Äì but with a few points worth noting. First, tempo is easiest to measure in ‚Äúframes,‚Äù referring to a single video frame when playing back video on standard 30 frame-per-second video (the kind your smart phone or digital camera is set to film in by default). One frame therefore equals 1/30th of a second. By counting the video frames, you can easily quantify tempo in reference to a whole number (like 22 frames), rather than its correspondingly messy unit of time (22/30 = 0.733 seconds).
Second: tempo doesn‚Äôt directly refer to a pitcher‚Äôs time to the plate ‚Äì although the two are strongly correlated. When measuring and examining tempo, I‚Äôm discussing the phase from peak leg lift until ball release. This is the piece of the throw that allows us to best compare tempo between windup vs. stretch throws of the same pitcher, and gives us a consistent frame of reference for comparing tempo between pitchers, an idea originated by Paul Nyman in the early 2000‚Äôs.
To illustrate this point, let‚Äôs compare Jacob Degrom‚Äôs tempo (using this method) between the windup and the stretch. Many would assume that his tempo is slower from the wind-up, but if you analyze video of him you‚Äôll find that he is consistently 19-21 frames from peak leg lift to ball release in both cases, despite a much ‚Äúslower‚Äù time to the plate out of the wind-up.
The third noteworthy point about tempo is this: a high level delivery, in regards to tempo, has an acceleration of the center of mass into ball release¬†(acceleration is the rate of change of velocity).
It‚Äôs not just the overall rate or tempo that matters, it‚Äôs also the building¬†up of this tempo that identifies how high level throwers move down the mound.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the overall rate or tempo that matters, it‚Äôs also the building up of this tempo that identifies how high level throwers move down the mound.‚Äù
Take, for instance, this gif of Nolan Ryan, edited so that every 5th frame is shown. Notice how the distance covered increases each interval, even though the time elapsed between frames is identical. Nolan Ryan is accelerating down the mound, and almost (if not all) high level throwers do this.
One thing Nyman noticed when he began examining tempo 2 decades ago was that the vast majority of high level (95+ mph) throwers had tempos in the 20-25 frame range, quicker than many amateur and lower velocity pitchers.
Just look at how fast 20 frames is with Craig Kimbrel throwing in full speed:
Let‚Äôs slow that down so you can actually see what‚Äôs happening:
This rule of thumb hasn‚Äôt changed since then, but I‚Äôd still like to give more of a sampling of what this looks like:
Nolan Ryan had a pretty standard tempo for 95+ mph throwers, around 21-23 frames.
Some more examples‚Ä¶
Nathan Eovaldi is on the slower side for 100 mph throwers (he doesn‚Äôt have an aggressive first move to the plate), but is still relatively quick at 23-25 frames from peak leg lift to ball release.
What about Gerrit Cole? He threw upper 90s both in high school and in the MLB. As it turns out, despite some noticeable ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù changes to his delivery since then, his tempo has barely changed, from 23-24 frames in high school to 24-25 frames currently. This is likely due to the reduction in aggressiveness of his first move to the plate.
By contrast, here are a couple amateur athletes who have what I would consider fairly clean patterns and sequencing, but tempo is one of their main differences from high level throwers.
As you can see, both athletes tend to ‚Äústay back‚Äù much more than most 95+ mph throwers, not shifting their weight forwards as aggressively during the initial leg lift. As such, the rest of the throw takes longer to unfold. Rather than being in the 20-25 frames range, both fall over 30 frames with their tempos.
Despite this, it‚Äôs still possible to throw quite hard with a slower tempo, if sequencing and other factors are still good (more on this below).
As I discussed in my previous post on the drift, most hard throwers initiate their center of mass towards the target early. This, I believe, is what accounts for most of the difference seen in tempo between low and higher velocity pitchers. Just rushing through poor patterns faster isn‚Äôt the solution ‚Äì the sequencing, weight shift and positions of high level throwers are still extremely important for increasing tempo to yield any benefit.
‚ÄúJust rushing through poor patterns faster isn‚Äôt the solution ‚Äì sequencing, weight shift and positions are still important for increasing tempo to yield any benefit.‚Äù
Another reason tempo is correlated to harder throwers is the lack of energy leaks. Minimizing major pauses or hesitations maximizes segmental energy transfer. It also makes use of the stretch shortening cycle ‚Äì the elastic recoil in your muscles/fascia that is available for a brief instant following a pre-stretch of the muscle. Think about how much more power you‚Äôve got if you bounce a bench press out of the bottom vs. pausing at the bottom first ‚Äì that‚Äôs a big reason why pauses or hitches in your arm action reduce the available power via a loss of the stretch reflex.
I‚Äôm not saying to bounce bench press reps (or even to bench press), just that we are powerful and springy when we can minimize unnecessary pauses in movement patterns and move dynamically out of our end ranges.
If you‚Äôve been keeping up with these posts, you already know that there are no such thing as absolutes when it comes to pitching mechanics. While the hardest throwers almost all fall into the 20-25 frame range, not all of them do. Furthermore, quicker than this isn‚Äôt generally better, because it takes a certain amount of time to allow energy to build sequentially through the delivery. If quicker were better, we‚Äôd see more examples of 100 mph quick-pitches in the 15 frames range.
One former pitching coach from the late 90‚Äôs/early 2000‚Äôs, the late Dick Mills, toyed with this idea in his now extinct philosophy of ‚Äúmomentum pitching.‚Äù Though it was a complete 180 of the philosophy he espoused up to that point, he hung his hat on this (flawed) idea for the last years of his coaching.
[Dick Mills on momentum pitching] ‚ÄúWhen done correctly it will increase a pitcher‚Äôs stride length to a minimum of 100% of his height instead of 90% minimum which was previously recommended. I have had success getting pitchers to stride over a foot beyond the height of their body. This added stride length is an indication of their momentum and speed of movement‚Ä¶the two most important elements for improving velocity.
This technique allows the build up of more kinetic energy (movement energy) that converts to more elastic energy upon landing. This stretching out of the pitcher‚Äôs body like a huge rubber band produces elastic energy and is how the body ‚Äúsling shots‚Äù the arm into ball release at very fast speeds.‚Äù
The only problem with his theory is that it didn‚Äôt work all that well in practice, and failed to catch on due to the lack of results. We can agree that having a running start would increase velocity in most pitchers, but it‚Äôs clear that just increasing tempo and trying to lunge at the plate isn‚Äôt a substitute for a running start, nor is it the most efficient way to shift the center of mass from a stand still.
Here‚Äôs one of his former students showing this extreme up tempo approach, which is hard to measure without a true leg lift but comes to somewhere in the 14-16 frames range.
Remember that Nolan Ryan gif from above? Hard throwers build into their deliveries, with late acceleration into landing. Below, notice how there is a relatively constant tempo through the delivery (every 5th frame shown, approximate vertical axis of center of mass shown in red).
The Achilles‚Äô heel of Dick Mills‚Äô theory was not understanding that linear momentum is only a piece of the puzzle ‚Äì not the whole puzzle. Sequencing ‚Äì how the body segments relate to one another ‚Äì ends up playing a larger role in velocity production than tempo (or linear momentum) in isolation.
What about x, y and z big leaguer who has a slower tempo than this? How do they do it?
The answer is first: that tempo isn‚Äôt everything. Tempo, however, allows for smoother energy transfer to take place in the majority of cases ‚Äì by minimizing unnecessary pauses, delayed weight shift and energy leaks. But if tempo only accounts for a sliver of the velocity puzzle, you‚Äôre sure to find some hard throwers who don‚Äôt quite fit.
Ah yes, here‚Äôs one.
Caminero is an example of one of the slowest tempo 100 mph throwers that I‚Äôve seen (30-31 frames). However, his sequencing is damn-near perfect, he gets into incredible positions, and he‚Äôs listed at a monstrous 6‚Äô4‚Ä≥ 250 lbs (and clearly reasonably lean). Point being, he makes up for his lack of tempo in other ways, allowing him to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the rules for hard throwers. I‚Äôd also like to point out my observation that, in general, long armed pitchers may require slightly longer for their arm actions to unfold, so it‚Äôs possible that body type plays a role in tempo as well and this actually could be what‚Äôs optimal for him. Randy Johnson (6‚Äô10‚Äù) supports this hypothesis as well.
Two main ways ‚Äì the first is not ruining it in the first place by actively cueing slow tempo and balance points. Just by encouraging athleticism and intensity, tempo has a way of improving itself.
‚ÄúJust by encouraging athleticism and intensity, tempo has a way of improving itself.‚Äù
Drills like walking wind-ups (or just throwing/long tossing out of the windup in general) are also useful for that.
What you don‚Äôt want to do is take a broken sequence (flying open, not segmenting the hips and shoulders, etc.) and just rush through that broken sequence faster to improve tempo.
Always address fundamental sequencing issues before tempo if both issues exist. If tempo starts to clean itself up on the way ‚Äì bonus points for you.
However, the second and primary way to address tempo is actually indirectly, using the drift concept. By shifting your weight sooner (dynamic balance point) it sets up an inevitable acceleration and quick tempo for the rest of the throw (so as not to fall on your face).
Thus, we work on tempo indirectly with most of our athletes, but still use it as a diagnostic tool for determining if an athlete is way outside of the typical hard throwing range.
Most of the hardest throwers have a quick tempo ‚Äì they get there not by rushing through their deliveries, but by shifting their weight efficiently towards the plate. This helps minimize energy leakages and maximize the elastic properties of the muscles.
While dynamic and athletic drills can help encourage this, some pitchers may need to fundamentally address how they initiate their weight shift towards the target.
For coaches, examining tempo using frame-counting from peak leg lift to ball release is just another tool in your toolbox for identifying and addressing mechanical limitations.

The Top 10 Do's and Don'ts for Optimal Recovery,2019-02-19T15:00:30+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/recovery-top-10/,"The initial spike in workload, in (often) underprepared athletes, is largely to blame for this fact.
While muscle, connective tissue and nervous system recovery take time, this rate of recovery can be improved to a point.
That‚Äôs what this post is all about ‚Äì reviewing what works, and what doesn‚Äôt, when it comes to your recovery.
These factors are not all equally weighted ‚Äì some of them may play a significant role, while others will have smaller impact on your ability to recovery quickly. Furthermore, this article is about the basics ‚Äì I considered writing about the dozen fancy gadgets and gizmos that can benefit recovery ‚Äì but while many of these can help, I ultimately decided to keep this as practical and widely applicable as possible. I‚Äôll mention some of the additional modalities you can look further into at the end of the article. If it helps (or if it even has a chance of helping), I‚Äôve likely tried it. Though much of this is based on anecdotal experience in myself and the athletes Tread has worked with as a company, I will make sure to include scientific references and detail mechanisms of action where possible.
Not all of this is groundbreaking, but I‚Äôve found that sometimes the tried-and-true strategies get lost in the shuffle of whatever is newest and fanciest.
The following are the heavy hitters ‚Äì the modalities that are tried and true. For general day-to-day recovery, focus most of your recovery attention to these things. Additional gadgets and modalities like the Marc Pro, Voodoo Floss, Microcurrent, Cold Laser, Shockwave, Normatec, etc. should make up significantly less of your focus ‚Äì and only once these three basics are in order.
Any discussion of recovery would be incomplete without mentioning the obvious ‚Äì active recovery involves light to moderate activity to drive blood into the muscles and connective tissues. This is best performed with exercises that have low impact, but create lots of blood flow to the area ‚Äì the point isn‚Äôt to do more damage to the tissues, but rather to stimulate the natural healing process.
Anecdotally, this is why generations of pitchers have claimed that distance runs or poles the day after a start seem to help reduce soreness and expedite recovery. Though the bro-science explanation of lactic acid clearance was wrong, the point stands ‚Äì active recovery works. Despite this, I would still argue that there are better ways to get an active recovery effect, that don‚Äôt have the potential to send the wrong training signal (aerobic vs. anaerobic energy systems).
Reducing impact and eccentric stress is one of the more important variables to consider when it comes to active recovery (and more generally, with conditioning, if the purpose is to minimally interfere with recovery).
Do you remember how sore your hamstrings got after that one time you ran a dozen hard 100 yard sprints?
Yeah, me too.
What about after heavy sled pushes, bike sprints or stair sprints?
Yeah, me either. Maybe the feeling of ‚Äúheavy‚Äù legs the next day if I overdid it, but never the type of soreness from true sprinting.
Why is this?
The difference in the latter options is they are concentric-only or ‚Äúpositive only‚Äù conditioning options, unlike flat ground sprinting (or in an extreme case, downhill sprinting).
It‚Äôs the deceleration or the eccentric phase in a movement that creates the most muscle damage ‚Äì a finding that has been consistently observed in the scientific literature.
Have you ever done slow eccentric squats and felt your quads, glutes and hamstrings the next day? Yeah. You know what I‚Äôm talking about.
Here are a couple sled sprint variations that we use with our remote athletes:
If most coaches understood just this one fact and looked at conditioning (at least for pitchers) as active recovery, you could almost do some sort of ‚Äúconditioning‚Äù on a daily basis. Instead, it has become the norm to do daily sprint work in most college and pro organizations ‚Äì a workload that is unsustainable for athletes who follow the typical instructions and go hard on all reps.
Eccentric stress adds up. Concentric stress does too, but much slower. As an extreme counter example, I‚Äôve actually done 10 minute bike intervals daily, 3 times per day, with positive recovery effects over time. Daily sprints for 10 minutes, on the other hand, always led to shin splints, heavy legs and decreased explosiveness after a couple weeks.
Most coaches should look at conditioning (at least for pitchers, and especially in-season) as active recovery, rather than conditioning or speed-work.
Rather than yelling at athletes for half-assing daily running (something that is a necessity to survive most irresponsibly designed running regimens), how about understanding that sometimes the goal should actually be to stay at a low to moderate intensity to help their muscles recover?
There‚Äôs a novel thought.
Mobility circuits can also serve a role in active recovery. These are essentially extended dynamic warm-ups, done up-tempo ‚Äì as the logic goes, why not be working on something productive while also increasing blood flow?
This is another great idea that you can play around with, but not all of the best mobility drills are up-tempo, blood flow inducing movements, so this shouldn‚Äôt make up the entirety of the mobility work prescribed to an athlete.
8-12 minutes of moderate intervals @50-75% intensity (15-30 sec sprint duration, 1 sprint per minute).
Options: bike, sled, stairs, ‚Äúdeadmill‚Äù sprints (below)
You‚Äôre doing it right if you have a light sweat, a decent burn through your quads and you don‚Äôt have sore or ‚Äúdead‚Äù legs the next day!
I don‚Äôt need to rehash this point too much, but suffice it to say that¬†lack of sleep¬†increases your chance of injury and decreases recovery and performance, while sleep extension¬†improves recovery and performance across a wide variety of studies and metrics.
We all intuitively know this, so I won‚Äôt bore you to death talking about how sleep is when your¬†natural growth hormone¬†is released. I certainly won‚Äôt mention that reaction time, accuracy, sprint times, motivation, focus, memory and injury susceptibility have all been¬†positively linked to improved sleep quality. And I definitely wouldn‚Äôt dare bring up the fact that¬†sleep hygiene¬†‚Äì which includes sleep supporting habits like a bedtime routine, using earplugs/sleeping masks, hanging blackout curtains and avoiding blue light/screens an hour before bed, is the most common recommendation for improving sleep quality.
No, I won‚Äôt do that. So let‚Äôs agree that sleep is one of those self-evident aspects of recovery that isn‚Äôt sexy, and is hard to take seriously in the face of so many screens and distractions.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt take it seriously.
‚ÄúSleep is one of those self-evident aspects of recovery that isn‚Äôt sexy, and is hard to take seriously in the face of so many distractions ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù
Note: if you‚Äôre interested in the recovery device that revolutionized the way I looked at and measured my sleep, check out my article on the Whoop Strap. A game-changing recovery and sleep monitoring device, they have recently switched over in 2019 from charging $400-500 for the strap to instead having a much more accessible monthly fee / subscription service so you can try it and see if you like it without the large up front investment.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre worrying about the brand of creatine you use or how many minutes you got on the Marc Pro device, but you‚Äôre still eating pop tarts and cinnamon toast crunch for breakfast, you‚Äôre a special kind of stupid.‚Äù
I‚Äôm not sure who came up with this quote (I would never say such insensitive things), but it found its way onto the page so we might as well discuss it.
Nutrition is a prerequisite for optimal recovery.
You spend hours training (and thus tearing down) your muscles in the weight room and on the field. Do you think think those fibers are just going to magically repair themselves bigger and stronger without you supplying the raw building blocks to do so?
Good luck with that hypothesis.
Most people spend so much effort focusing on the wrong nutritional variables, not understanding the order of priority when it comes to nutrition‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs easy to see why.
We are bombarded by supplement companies trying to convince us that their formulation is the next big thing (hint: most all of them aren‚Äôt. You can look up the scientific research on any supplement ingredient here). Meanwhile, people still believe in myths like eating multiple small meals per day will boost your metabolism or carbs ingested after 6pm will immediately turn into fat.
You‚Äôre confused ‚Äì I know I was. So let‚Äôs revisit the basics.
Calories are energy ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt have an equal or positive energy balance, your body is going to have to work a bit harder to recover. So don‚Äôt expect to be recovering optimally if you‚Äôre losing weight! This is especially relevant in-season, when most athletes forget to maintain the nutritional habits that they kept up with during the off-season.
Luckily, this is an easy fix. Track your calories (even when your goal is just to maintain weight) and make sure your bodyweight is staying steady. Bump calories up by 200 after 2 weeks if you‚Äôre losing weight.
Protein (broken down into what are called amino acids) makes up the building blocks of muscle tissue. It‚Äôs been known for decades just how important adequate protein intake is for muscle growth and repair ‚Äì and its importance increases even more in the absence of adequate calories.
Look to consume approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight. Slightly less is probably okay, and more won‚Äôt hurt you, but this is a good rule of thumb to cover your bases.
I‚Äôm 205-210 lbs, so I‚Äôll shoot for around 210 grams of protein per day. And don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì if you eat more than 30 grams of protein in a sitting it isn‚Äôt wasted. Protein beyond what is used to max out protein synthesis (and minimize protein degradation), will still be used for energy through a process that converts it to glucose (called gluconeogenesis). You don‚Äôt have to worry about getting fat from a high protein intake ‚Äì provided your overall calories are in order.
‚ÄúConsume approximately 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight‚Ä¶this will max out protein synthesis and minimize protein degradation‚Ä¶provided your overall calories are in order.‚Äù
While the other macros (carbs and fat) matter, micronutrients matter, hydration and meal timing matters, and supplements can have a minor impact, they simply aren‚Äôt as relevant until calories and protein are in place.
So let‚Äôs get that right first.
For more information on the rest of the nutritional hierarchy, check out Building the 95 MPH Body.
G Flux, to my knowledge, was a term first coined by Dr. John Berardi. It describes what we intuitively know: not all calorie balances are created equal.
Let‚Äôs take a maintenance example here:
Athlete A consumes 2500 calories per day, and burns 2500 calories per day. He is mostly sedentary besides a few weight training and throwing sessions per week. His net calorie balance is zero ‚Äì meaning he will maintain his weight.
Athlete B consumes 3500 calories per day, and burns 3500 calories per day. He is very active throughout the day, incorporates active recovery, and other strategies at his disposal. His net calorie balance is also zero, and he will maintain his weight as well.
But, counter to what many textbooks would have you believe, these two scenarios aren‚Äôt equivalent.
Athlete B has a higher total energy turnover, which comes with it a host of benefits as outlined by Dr. Berardi:
I‚Äôll be honest, when I read this article a while back, a giant lightbulb turned on in my head. This is something we intuitively know when we think about it. Cutting body fat at the highest intake possible is one example of this ‚Äì you can lose weight at the same rate if your daily expenditure is 2500 calories and you eat 2000 calories, or if your daily expenditure is 3500 and you eat 3000 ‚Äì but the difference in energy, body composition, recovery and everything else listed here isn‚Äôt even close.
I recovered quickly in college ‚Äì throwing 6 days per week and taking a Monday off, and my arm felt like I‚Äôd taken a week off. I was burning upwards of 4,000 calories a day, and it took me upwards of 5,000 calories to budge the scale in a positive direction. Walking a couple miles around campus to class, morning weights, and 3-5 hour practices quickly racked up my ‚ÄúG-Flux,‚Äù giving me a very high total energy turnover. Not only this, but I‚Äôd hit the bed like a rock every night, easily sleeping through the night.
Contrast this to my first off-season as a pro, and I was largely sedentary outside of my 90 minutes in the gym 4 days per week. My maintenance intake dropped to around 3,000 calories on training days, and even less on rest days.
When I was sore, it would linger. I felt more restless, and my sleep was never as consistent.
It‚Äôs a fine balance, and you definitely don‚Äôt want to over train in the name of increasing energy turnover, but I make sure to do some sort of active recovery every day (including walks and sauna sessions on rest days ‚Äì more on this later) in order to keep the energy turnover up without further breaking down the tissues.
G Flux isn‚Äôt a free pass to over train, but the point is to live an active lifestyle and move intelligently (and in a way that doesn‚Äôt detract from your recovery) beyond the confines of your weight training and throwing sessions. For in-season athletes, this is largely a moot point because you‚Äôre likely going to be extremely active by default, but it was worth reviewing this concept nonetheless.
These likely play a small role in recovery. For general recovery they are the equivalent of supplements in your diet ‚Äì they probably account for about 10% of the recovery benefit you hope to achieve.
Disclaimer ‚Äì I have no way to put these exact numbers on passive modalities ‚Äì just understand my point and don‚Äôt get your hopes up if you don‚Äôt suddenly triple your recovery rate using these tools. In my book, any incremental benefit I can get is probably worth it, and I have seen benefits with all of these. I originally had a half dozen additional modalities in this list, but many of them were expensive, impractical and require a trained therapist to administer. With that being said, these are some of the most accessible options of the bunch.
I first learned about the benefits of Sauna for recovery from Dr. Rhonda Patrick, who has written about the growing body of research on heat acclimation and athletic performance.
I‚Äôll link to her research summary here, but these are some of the notable effects of heat acclimation:
Sauna use induces a beneficial stress response in the body, causing the body to release what are called heat shock proteins. These proteins appear to be responsible for the increase in net protein synthesis by inhibiting muscle degradation or breakdown.
Net protein synthesis is the balance between anabolism (muscle building) and catabolism or degradation (muscle breakdown). By reducing the second part of the equation, you increase the potential for muscle growth and recovery from training, as well as the potential for reducing muscle atrophy if you suffer an injury and can‚Äôt train.
One study in rats looked at muscle atrophy following immobilization, and found that heat exposure decreased muscle loss by up to 32%.
Sauna use improves nutrient delivery to muscles, and causes a lower working heart rate and core body temperature. One study found that the time it took to run to exhaustion increased by 32% following sauna exposure, and that this was accompanied by an increase in blood plasma volume and red blood cell count.
Sauna use may boosts growth hormone 2 to 5 fold in the several hour period following exposure. Growth hormone plays a role in muscle repair by preventing muscle degradation.¬† These studies looked at protocols ranging from 30-40 total minutes of exposure and temperatures ranging from 176 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
I‚Äôve talked about the Marc Pro in the past here. I like it and many of our athletes do as well. While it‚Äôs far from a miracle tool, it‚Äôs probably worth trying if you have the resources to do so.
Here‚Äôs the main difference between the Marc Pro and standard TENS or muscle stim units: frequency, i.e. how many contractions per second. Cheap TENS units ‚Äúdrown out‚Äù pain signaling sensory nerves, making you temporarily feel better during (and possibly after) the treatment with a very high frequency of contraction. In my experience, not only do they not help recovery but they tend to be somewhat fatiguing due to the massive number of contractions stimulated.
‚ÄúCheap TENS units ‚Äúdrown out‚Äù pain signaling sensory nerves, making you temporarily feel better‚Ä¶but¬†they¬†tend¬†to¬†be¬†fatiguing.‚Äù
The Marc Pro doesn‚Äôt aim to overpower pain signaling nerves ‚Äì the idea is to stimulate passive muscle contractions at a much lower frequency ‚Äì one that doesn‚Äôt induce fatigue, and by doing so stimulate blood flow and fluid exchange in the treated area.
If you‚Äôre not following, here‚Äôs a simple way of thinking about it: TENS units are a strong numbing buzz, while the Marc Pro is a rhythmic, massage-like pulsing contraction.
Warning: the Marc pro Plus also has a high frequency setting ‚Äì if you have one, don‚Äôt use this setting for general recovery purposes.
Worth trying if you can get your hands on one and the steep pricetag doesn‚Äôt discourage you.
You can find my full review here.
Active Release Therapy, (ART) or manual therapy in general, isn‚Äôt as much for general recovery as it is for targeting specific problematic movement restrictions to allow you to move unrestricted and/or pain free.
In my experience, the direct effect on muscle soreness is negligible. However, we know that movement restrictions can alter the mechanics of your exercises or throwing mechanics. When this happens, it creates aberrant stresses on the body, because that energy isn‚Äôt able to be transmitted properly through your joints.
Maybe it‚Äôs a hip mobility issue that causes the knee or the low back to pick up the slack every time you throw ‚Äì and you wonder why your low back takes so long to recover. Maybe it‚Äôs a shoulder mobility issue that causes the elbow to shoot forward during ball release, leading to lower tricep pain ‚Äì and you wonder why your tricep takes so long to recover.
Poor recovery may not actually be poor recovery ‚Äì it may be stress accumulating at a given segment because of poor or altered movement patterns ‚Äì patterns that may be addressed with ART or other techniques that address the myofascia.
Self Myofascial Release (SMR), which is a blanket term for tissue work done to yourself, can also be effective ‚Äì the biggest difference being that a therapist knows where and what to target, and tend to be more precise than just smashing yourself with a foam roller or lacrosse ball.
If you can‚Äôt afford regular ART, though, you can always try getting a problematic spot checked out and take notes so that you have a better plan of action regarding how to target those tissues on your own moving forwards. Oftentimes, a training partner can help you with hard-to-reach areas.
Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not saying to perform unlicensed manual therapy ‚Äì I‚Äôm simply indicating that your own myofascial work can sometimes be aided by an extra set of hands ‚Äì or a teammate‚Äôs elbow ‚Äì if you can‚Äôt get leverage on your own.
While we write up very specific SMR routines for our athletes depending on their initial movement screen, not all athletes have that luxury.
Take home point: if you‚Äôre failing to recover at a specific part of your body, take a step back and try to figure out if anything you‚Äôre doing is over-stressing that segment. It‚Äôs probably not a systemic recovery issue.
I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äì I used to think the reason flossing worked so well was just because of blood flow. I‚Äôve since learned that it‚Äôs just as much about encouraging the fascia to move and slide properly. The compression from the wrap pins the fascia and tissues in place, and moving through it encourages the underlying layers of muscle and connective tissue to slide independently of the more superficial (pinned) layers.
On top of the above movements, nerve flossing for the ulnar, radial and median nerves works surprisingly well once you‚Äôve applied the voodoo band‚Ä¶and this is especially worth considering for athletes who may be dealing with nerve-related symptoms from time to time in their arm (disclaimer ‚Äì not a doc. I‚Äôve just seen it work).
Okay, I think we can all agree this post has taken on a life of its own. But before we wrap it up, I can‚Äôt help myself but to touch on a couple final factors that could be actively worsening your recovery.
This may be controversial, because it flies in the face of conventional wisdom, but acute inflammation is not the enemy. Inflammation begins the healing cascade, signaling your body to send in the troops responsible for repairing the damaged area. In normal circumstances, this isn‚Äôt a bad thing.
In fact, rather than constricting blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the recovering area, you should be seeking to increase blood flow to the tissue through active recovery.
What doesn‚Äôt make much sense is coaches or athletes who believe in distance ‚Äúflush‚Äù runs but also believe in icing the arm ‚Äì which work on two opposing mechanisms of action (increasing vs. decreasing blood flow).
Icing and Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen may temporarily relieve pain, but this comes at the cost of slightly delaying recovery.
More problematic than this, however, is that most athletes that use Ibuprofen use it as a crutch to push through pain and soreness. It‚Äôs not the miniscule theoretical drop in recovery as much as this ‚Äì slapping a band-aid on the symptoms and throwing through fatigue, soreness and injury ‚Äì that predisposes athletes to an increased injury risk.
Most athletes that use Ibuprofen use it as a crutch to push through pain and soreness.
Look, I‚Äôm not saying that there is never a place for ice or NSAIDs. Chronic inflammation, severe inflammation following a major injury, or knowingly pounding 6 Advil to get through your league championship game (understanding the risk of injury) may all be valid circumstances.
I‚Äôm talking to the habitual icers and pill-poppers who use them for standard pre and post throwing soreness.
You‚Äôre likely doing more harm than good.
Finally, let‚Äôs look at what Dr. Gabe Mirkin, who coined the term RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation), has to say after watching the research evolve over the past several decades:
‚ÄúWhen I wrote my best-selling¬†Sportsmedicine Book¬†in 1978, I coined the term¬†RICE¬†(Rest,¬†Ice,¬†Compression,¬†Elevation) for the treatment of athletic injuries. Ice has been a standard treatment for injuries and sore muscles because it helps to relieve pain caused by injured tissue. Coaches have used my ‚ÄúRICE‚Äù guideline for decades, but now it appears that both Ice and complete Rest may delay healing, instead of helping.‚Ä¶when muscles and other tissues are damaged, your immunity sends the same inflammatory cells to the damaged tissue to promote healing. The response to both infection and tissue damage is the same. Inflammatory cells rush to injured tissue to start the healing process‚Ä¶The inflammatory cells called macrophages release a hormone called Insulin-like growth Factor (IGF-1) into the damaged tissues, which helps muscles and other injured parts to heal. However, applying ice to reduce swelling actually delays healing by preventing the body from releasing IGF-1.‚Äù
This links well with the previous point, in that the goal is not to simply apply band-aids to yourself to get through today, it‚Äôs to establish routines and habit that will set you up for consistent progress, recovery and adaptation.
One of the most common band-aids is caffeine consumption.
Not in the sense that caffeine is directly hurting your recovery (although it will, indirectly if you begin to have disturbed sleep), but in the sense of how most athletes use it.
I‚Äôll agree ‚Äì it‚Äôs cool to stay up until 2am, wake up for a 6 am lift and realize that you can still move some weight in the weight room after 2 scoops of pre-workout. It‚Äôs tempting for many athletes to ignore their sleep and nutritional habits, given the quick fix that caffeine seems to supply.
But that quick fix is an illusion ‚Äì and you can‚Äôt mask poor recovery habits forever with caffeine.
Instead, focus on your sleep and recovery so that you don‚Äôt typically need caffeine to get it going in the weight room.
Use it sparingly, rather than excessively, and you‚Äôll be far more in tune with your actual recovery (and stay sensitive to the effects of caffeine when you do use it).
I‚Äôll typically use a scoop of pre-workout a couple times per week (although I don‚Äôt need it to have productive training). I stay sensitive to it, and while I‚Äôll occasionally use it to power through a particularly long day, I make sure to not let this become a chronic habit.
But who am I kidding ‚Äì most of you reading this aren‚Äôt going to heed my advice until you learn the hard way.
‚ÄúAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure‚Äù
Much of the time athletes recover poorly because of what‚Äôs right in front of their nose: excess workload.
Do you really need 4 drop sets for your biceps in the weightroom? Or 5 sets of 10 eccentric squats in-season?
Do you really need to do 10 arm care exercises pre and post throwing, even though your scapular muscles and posterior cuff always feel fatigued and overworked?
Do you really need to be throwing 75 or 85% intensity on your light throwing days, or taking 15-20 throws at your max distance on long toss days?
Most of the time, addressing the workload issue is more than half of the solution, because you won‚Äôt be able to out-recover an excessive workload, no matter how much sleep or Marc Pro-ing you do.
Recovery doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. Make sure your bases are covered on the main variables like sleep, calories, protein intake, active recovery and workload management.
Those in place, try incorporating additional strategies like sauna sessions, Marc Pro and Voodoo flossing, and try ditching the ice, ibuprofen and caffeine when it‚Äôs not entirely necessary. Finally, keep an eye on any particularly troublesome areas where stress seems to be accumulating, and look for what in your movement mechanics or mobility may be contributing ‚Äì getting a movement screen is a good idea if you don‚Äôt know where to start.

"The ""Drift"" - How to Shift Your Weight Like a Pro",2019-02-06T17:32:43+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/the-drift/,"This post goes hand in hand with this youtube video. Give it a watch after completing this article.
I will be honest, I didn‚Äôt have much of a clue how to use my lower half for just about all of high school and college. As a guy who was trying to learn hard-throwing mechanics from total scratch, it was too many moving parts, to where I just gave up and decided to throw from a slide step.
Life was better that way ‚Äì I could just come set, pick my
front foot up and put it right back down again. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about a
leg lift throwing my timing off and yanking open my front side.
This worked ‚Äì to a point. But only because I was tall
enough, athletic enough and had an arm that moved well enough to do so.
I touched 87 this way in high school (whoop-dee-do), and touched 93 in college before ever learning I actually had this thing called a back leg.
I eventually learned how to use my glutes and hamstrings to propel myself forward and transfer that energy up the chain. This was largely by accident, as I described in this article ‚Äì I was trying to imitate Fernando Rodney, who gave me hope that throwing 100 mph was possible from a slide step after seeing him do so in the world baseball classic.¬† My long toss (which I performed out of my slide step rather than a crow hop) jumped up from 330 to 380 feet in one day.
Yes, I was using my glutes and hamstrings for the first time ever, but it was the positions I was getting into prior to the lateral drive that allowed me to actually tap into those muscles and transmit that energy laterally through my center of mass.
Rodney sat back into his heel, leaned into the target and then utilized his glute and hamstring to begin the drive. But that initial move started the weight shift ‚Äì and that initial move, for me, was everything.
I didn‚Äôt overthink it beyond that for a few years. I did roll-ins to learn to separate my hips and shoulders, and I threw like Rodney from my slide-step. From then on I was mostly 90-93 touching 95, good enough to get drafted. After being released, some tweaks got this to consistently 94-95, still not where I would have liked it to be.
Maybe my genetics really were
a limiting factor to how hard I could ever throw. Were all these teammates
touching upper 90‚Äôs really that much more gifted athletes?
I refused to believe so, and decided to keep searching
Note: I‚Äôm not saying everyone can throw upper 90‚Äôs if they just try hard enough, but in my case I had most of the things that are hard to teach, like fast twitch ability, shoulder laxity, levers, etc. so I felt there was a good chance it was still possible I was underachieving relative to my potential.
The next breakthrough occurred in another odd experiment. I had been trying to rehab what I would soon learn was a partial UCL sprain. It had been lingering for several months and was not responsive to conservative therapy and rest. An MRI showed nothing wrong, as did a first stress ultrasound. In a stress ultrasound, the doctor applies a valgus force to the medial elbow while the technician has a live feed of the ligament on the screen so that a tear can be diagnosed if the ligament displaces more than it should.
I pointed out that the technician maybe applied 5 lbs of valgus force to my elbow during the first negative test ‚Äì far less than in throwing a 90 mph fastball and not enough to recreate that sharp pain. I knew something was wrong with my elbow, so I requested a second diagnostic ultrasound test where they would apply enough pressure to replicate the sharp pain I felt while throwing.
Leading into the test, I was instructed to throw beforehand
until I replicated the symptoms.
The slide-step, normally consistently 93+ on flat ground, was down around 88. Not surprising ‚Äì my elbow was sharp and stabbing. That‚Äôs to be expected. After a few, I hopped on the mound to throw about 5 more. Healthy, my mound work would normally have been 1-2 mph harder than flat, but I hadn‚Äôt been on a mound in over a year.
I tossed a few: 90-91. Okay cool, so everything is down about 4-5 mph today. Not surprising. But then I decided to try something I had been toying over in my head ‚Äì after watching this throw from Tim Lincecum, back when he was topping triple digits as the skinniest, most promising pitcher in the world.
It was the same thing I noticed in my own slide step ‚Äì if I could get the weight shifted further away from the rubber before getting into and driving off my back leg, the upper half and arm snapped through quicker.
If I was about to need surgery or months of rehab, now was
my chance to test it out for a few throws.
What I expected was 90, maybe 91 at best. It felt awkward as
my first time trying it, and I was very obviously not synced up properly. Sharp
pain shot through my arm with each throw.
94.6.
94.3
94.1
94.3
94.1
‚Ä¶
Where would those numbers be when I‚Äôm not down 4 miles per hour on everything else, first time on the
mound in a year and throwing indoors through sharp shooting pain?
This is when I knew the ‚Äúdrift‚Äù ‚Äì one of the keys to Tim
Lincecum‚Äôs efficiency, could be a secret weapon.
I just had no idea how to harness or teach it.
‚ÄúThis is when I knew the ‚Äòdrift‚Äô could be a secret weapon‚Ä¶I just had no idea how to harness it.‚Äù
Though I‚Äôm still working to find my way back into full health (I‚Äôll save you the details ‚Äì my elbow is fine now), I was sitting 96-98 in indoor bullpens after elbow surgery utilizing this ‚Äúdrift‚Äù ‚Äì while the slide step stayed exactly where it should have been: 94-95.
So what is the drift? How do we teach it? What other big leaguers do it? Why does it work?
Let‚Äôs dive in to my current thoughts, in trying to explain this phenomenon.
The drift is a term I coined to refer to the initial forward move that occurs during the leg lift ‚Äì this is not an active drive, but a shifting of the center of mass forwards, away from the rubber, preceding the active drive phase of the back leg.
Despite being what the majority of high level throwers do to initiate forward motion, this is counter to what traditional pitching teaches with ‚Äúbalance points,‚Äù which focus on keeping the weight gathered over the pitching rubber during leg lift and prior to the linear move or drive off back leg.
Watch Nolan Ryan execute this move below:
Interestingly, this explains why Ryan said that he felt he threw harder when he lifted his leg higher ‚Äì because the leg lift was his cue to move forwards, the higher he lifted it, the further he was able to get away from the rubber before sitting into the back leg.
Three reasons I believe this hasn‚Äôt been discussed much in the pitching realm.
#1: Most pitchers who drift, don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre doing it. Oftentimes, they just try to be athletic and up tempo, and their bodies learned early on that shifting their weight during leg lift allowed them to throw harder. It‚Äôs also common that some pitchers throw harder from the windup, not realizing that it‚Äôs the forward move during leg lift that sets them up for better energy transfer later on in the throw.
#2: It‚Äôs easier to teach balance points. You can take a group of 12 year olds and work on an up-down-out lower half in a very systematic and repeatable way. Try to teach a 12 year old how to move dynamically through his leg lift ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to have a hard time making much headway in all but the most athletic kids. Balance is easy ‚Äì and to some extent, it might help create more repeatable mechanics in the majority of kids who are falling all over the place when they throw. But just because it lowers a 12 year old‚Äôs walk rate doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs what the majority of the hardest throwers in the world do.
#3: It‚Äôs hard to see this weight shift from a rear view ‚Äì you know, the only camera angle ever shown on live baseball broadcasts. Begin to pick apart side angles of your favorite big leaguers, and it tells a completely different story. Let‚Äôs take a look.
There are two main ‚Äústyles‚Äù of drift, as far as I can tell.
The coil and drift ‚Äì this style incorporates a counter rotation to initiate that forward move. They hit their dynamic balance point 6-8 inches out front of the rubber. This is what worked best for me.
Bartolo Colon threw 100 back in the day. Watch how he uses this initial move to hit a dynamic position away from the rubber.
Roger Clemens touched upper 90‚Äôs, using a coiling mechanism to initiate movement towards the plate.
Aroldis Chapman moves forward as he lifts, setting up efficient lower half positions.
Tim Lincecum ‚Äì back when he threw hard, shifted his weight the most aggressively, while keeping everything on time.
Bruce Rondon has consistently thrown over 100 mph ‚Äì his dynamic balance point occurs out front of the rubber, allowing his center of mass to be rapidly accelerated laterally by the back leg.
The straight on target drift ‚Äì this style doesn‚Äôt have any counter rotating, the pitchers just hit their peak leg lift out front of the rubber. They‚Äôre still hitting their dynamic balance point 6-8 inches out front, rather than stacked over the rubber.
Jacob Degrom has been up to triple digits as a starter.
Justin Verlander is obviously Justin Verlander. Over triple digits deep in games whenever he wants.
Carson Fulmer was up to 99 at Vanderbilt at 5‚Äô11‚Äù. His weight comes forward during the leg lift, only then does he stay back during his drive once the train starts moving.
Robert Stock has been upwards of 100 mph and made his underdog debut in 2018. Watch how he shifts forward during leg lift, hitting the drift.
Gerrit Cole (in high school, here), aggressively shifted his weight before applying the back leg to his center of mass ‚Äì saving up this hip abduction until it could be used efficiently.
Aaron Sanchez, who appears to be ‚Äúall arm‚Äù from rear view broadcasts, actually makes excellent use of the drift to shift his weight towards the target. While he doesn‚Äôt have much drive off the back leg, this shift helps utilize what drive he has.
If you‚Äôre wondering how to be able to tell if a pitcher does the drift, after reading this article, ask yourself: would he be able to pause if you forced him to stop his delivery at peak leg lift? The answer should be no, he would fall on his face, because if he‚Äôs able to hold his peak leg lift it means the center of mass is still directly over the back foot.
Even if you don‚Äôt notice a heavy forward move, many pitchers maintain the ‚Äúdrift‚Äù even in their slide steps or abbreviated leg lifts by coming set wide so that their center of mass starts out front of the rubber. A lot of them also bias more of their weight towards the front foot so that when they lift the front leg they are already moving forwards. Once they hit that dynamic balance point, then they shift into ‚Äústay back‚Äù mode, where the head and upper half are held back over the rear hip once the train starts moving.
Foltynewicz (who tops out in the triple digits), demonstrating the drift in an abbreviated leg lift.
Roy Oswalt, coming set 60-40 on the front leg to encourage this drift / weight shift during a quick-pitch or abbreviated leg lift.
We can keep going down the list, but I‚Äôll stop there.
This is my best guess for why it seems to be effective. Just like linear momentum rasies potential ball velocity in a running pulldown (assuming you can transfer that to the ball), an increase in linear momentum in the pitching delivery would raise potential ball velocity as well.
How do you do this in an efficient way?
Trying to sit deep into your back leg without shifting your weight, and then lunging off your back side may work, but it‚Äôs very energy intensive. You also deal with the problem of much of that initial force being directed straight down into the ground, rather than directed more laterally into the pitching rubber.
The drift is a ‚Äúfree‚Äù movement that hardly costs any energy , and allows you to save that available hip/knee extension and hip abduction until the majority of it can be directed laterally into the ground (once the center of mass has actually shifted away from the rubber).
I liken this to standing directly next to someone and trying
to knock them over with your hip, to standing 6-8 inches away from them and
trying to knock them over with your hip ‚Äì the increase in efficiency and force
is substantial, so saving up your rear leg until all of that force can be directed where you want it is probably
more effective than muscling your way down the mound.
‚ÄúSaving up your rear leg until all of that force can be directed where you want is probably more effective than muscling your way down the mound‚Äù
In theory, yes.
Waiting to apply your back leg into the throw until the center of mass has shifted away from the rubber should give you more usable energy towards the target.
In practice, no.
Some pitchers have learned to time and sequence up their deliveries based upon this balance point position they were taught, and so trying to change the forward motion during leg lift can screw with the timing of everything else up the chain.
We had this issue with Andrew Owen, a pitcher that came to us at 90-92 mph and got to sitting 94-96 indoors before being signed by the Cardinals.
We actually tried, after the initial velo bump, to change his weight shift, and it led to a timing breakdown further up the chain and worse numbers. Rather than force through a change, we stuck to what was working and backed off, allowing his body to stick to what was eliciting the best results for him. This doesn‚Äôt mean the concept wouldn‚Äôt work in theory, but chasing it wasn‚Äôt worth it in this instance, especially given how close he was to the spring season and trying to get signed.
A rare example of an elite velo guy who doesn‚Äôt have much drift is Nathan Eovaldi. He comes to what is basically a balance point, then drops, drives and rotates. Before you claim that this totally disproves my theory, just realize that he‚Äôs:
This just goes to show why there are so few absolutes when it comes to pitching mechanics ‚Äì even if the drift is worth miles per hour for most pitchers, it doesn‚Äôt make it an absolute necessity for throwing hard if other boxes are checked to overcome this one inefficiency, and that potential velocity might not be readily accessible unless you can still sequence the finish of the throw.
If the goal is to maximize velocity, it‚Äôs clear that the vast majority of the hardest throwers in the world have a shift of their center of mass during leg lift. Some do this more aggressively than others, but the strictly interpreted up-down-out method is not the most efficient from a weight shift perspective.
Still, some MLBers exist who swear by balance points as far as repeating their deliveries, and although many of these guys don‚Äôt throw into the truly elite ranges (most of these guys are low 90‚Äôs, touching mid 90‚Äôs), who am I to argue with them? Not everybody needs to throw upper 90s to get to where they need to go, and I‚Äôm receptive to the fact that some pitchers probably are aided by a slower tempo and keeping their weight back during their leg lift.
Would this be my first choice to teach to an athlete who
comes to me desperately needing to add velocity? No.
Ah, now we‚Äôre talking. I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I still don‚Äôt fully know how to reliably teach it. Some guys get it, others it can take a long time or sometimes never quite clicks. Part of the struggle is that it‚Äôs hard to practice and repeat at lower efforts ‚Äì the body positions that the drift put you in really force you to drive very hard and yanks the upper half through in order to not fall on your face. As such, it‚Äôs not the easiest thing to work on with 30% effort dry reps.
A few cues/drills to try:
This is one of my favorite cues for athletes who are working on the drift, because it lets them worry about keeping everything the same in their leg lift except one variable ‚Äì a slight lean into the target! Everyone interprets this differently so if they‚Äôre screwing up the move, we‚Äôll change cues.
This is one of the main cues we used with my buddy Kyle ‚Äì catch his before/after below:
Worth noting for Kyle, it took him about 6 weeks to feel comfortable with the move to where it represented such a significant bump in velocity as shown above.
I like this cue because it still helps create a repeatable, controlled feel to the leg lift (in other words, not an uncontrolled fall).  It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre just hitting your balance point a bit further out front instead of right over the rubber. Justin Verlander is a perfect example of this ‚Äì if you were to keep his delivery exactly the same but take away the drift, he wouldn‚Äôt throw nearly as hard or sustain that velocity as deep into game.
Another way of thinking about it, this can help guys learn to shift their weight, and is probably an under-appreciated reason why hooking the rubber may help certain guys as much as it does ‚Äì it encourages the athlete‚Äôs  center of mass to stay in front of the rubber during leg lift.
Understanding the concept is one thing, but actually being able to do it is another. We‚Äôve found that just trying to do this move from one‚Äôs delivery can feel very flat-footed, so being dynamic is the best way to learn it. While walking wind-ups are a good tool once you begin to feel this move, a better option to learn it is step-back drills, which force the weight to stay out in front of the back foot.
This can feel a lot more dynamic and makes the move a million times easier to learn. As it gets comfortable, shorten the distance of the step back.
The ‚Äúdrift‚Äù is just one piece of the larger velocity equation ‚Äì a commonality between most (but not all) of the hardest throwers in the world. My best estimate is that it might account for 2-5 potential miles per hour, but just like a running pulldown increases potential velocity, that is contingent upon being able to stay well timed and sequenced further up the kinetic chain. If the timing isn‚Äôt there, it may actual worsen your velocity slightly, so keep in mind this is probably best experimented with in your off-season throwing, using objective feedback like radar readings to reinforce your best reps.
I would liken the ‚Äúdrift‚Äù to icing on a cake in the grand scheme of building an efficient delivery ‚Äì if you still can‚Äôt segment your hips and shoulders, get your arm on time, accelerate your arm without pushing and transfer energy efficiently through a braced front leg, adding more momentum is just going to create further breakdowns. Once these mechanical guard rails are in place, you likely have a better chance of benefiting from the adjustment.

How Does Hip Anatomy Affect Your Mechanics?,2019-01-30T16:20:05+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/how-does-hip-anatomy-affect-your-ideal-mechanics/,"This post goes hand in hand with this youtube video. Give it a watch after completing this article.
Do perfect mechanics exist? It‚Äôs tempting to think they do. Why then, do we see such mechanical differences between the best pitchers in the world? Certainly, efficient mechanics exist. One can hardly argue that any delivery that elicits 100 miles per hour isn‚Äôt at least reasonably free of energy leakages. While many commonalities exist between the most efficient mechanics, I would argue it‚Äôs impossible to come to an agreement on what ideal mechanics even are given the massive structural and anthropometric variability between individuals.
This is why I make a point for the athletes I coach to study and learn from high level throwers who have similar sizes, proportions and frames to them ‚Äì it makes little sense to have a 5‚Äô8‚Ä≥ athlete study the sequencing of 6‚Äô10‚Äù Randy Johnson, and vice versa. These are obvious examples where the structures are too different to accurately extrapolate one‚Äôs movement patterns to another.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to come to an agreement on what ideal mechanics even are given the structural variability between individuals.‚Äù
Even when you take height into consideration, anthropometry can still be a glaring difference that affects how each individual sequences their body parts ‚Äì making extrapolation even more confusing if you don‚Äôt pick the right pitchers to model after.
Here‚Äôs one example.
I went through a period in college where I experimented with some of Aroldis Chapman‚Äôs movements, timing and body positions.
It didn‚Äôt really work.
The timing was off, and I could never get my arms that far behind my body or properly sequence things using a similar tempo.
Though he‚Äôs 6‚Äô4‚Ä≥ 225 lbs, and I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3‚Ä≥ 215 ‚Äì close on paper ‚Äì the differences in torso, leg and arm length (not to mention his insane shoulder laxity), made these positions (and more importantly, timing) all but impossible for my own structure to imitate.
What specifically works for Chapman ‚Äì the timing, sequencing and body positions relative to each other ‚Äì won‚Äôt necessarily work for another pitcher. If it does, they are probably built just like him (take a look at my buddy, Solo, who is similarly proportioned with something like a 6‚Äô9‚Ä≥ wingspan at 6‚Äô3‚Ä≥ tall).
But there are more subtle ways in which body structure affects mechanics, beyond easily noticeable variables like height and body proportions.
Let‚Äôs talk about one such variable: hip anatomy, and how it relates to individual mechanics and velocity.
Let‚Äôs take a look at a few big leaguers, in no particular order: Fernando Rodney, Justin Verlander, Masahiro Tanaka and Carson Fulmer.
I want you to watch their lower halves ‚Äì what do you notice?
It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to see that Rodney and Tanaka internally rotate the rear hip, using this position to load the hips and drive laterally towards the plate, while Fulmer and Verlander externally¬†rotate the rear hip, holding on to a vertical rear shin angle as long as possible while the front leg swings open. Interestingly, their lead legs mirror the rear leg, showing similar internally or externally rotated positions.
Most pitchers are somewhere between these two extremes ‚Äì the knee-to-knee drive, which requires exceptional hip internal rotation ‚Äì and the vertical shin drive, which relies on excellent hip external rotation and abduction.
With examples of big leaguers on both ends of the spectrum, it begs the question: which type of lower half drive is more efficient? And if the answer is: it depends, what factors does it depend on?
We all know athletes who have excellent hip external rotation ‚Äì sitting cross-legged or doing a pigeon pose are no problems for their hips. But put them in any position that requires internal rotation and they‚Äôre likely to struggle.
On the flip side, athletes who have large degrees of internal rotation tend to come up short when you test them into external. As you can see below, I wouldn‚Äôt exactly be the best candidate for sitting cross-legged as I run out of room very quickly into ER.
So what‚Äôs going on here? Why can‚Äôt some athletes just mobilize their way to having excellent external and internal?
Mobility work helps to a point, but ultimately you may run into a hard limiting factor: your bony anatomy.
Hip structure can vary in a number of significant ways between individuals, but what is perhaps most relevant to this conversation about rotation range of motion is what‚Äôs called hip anteversion and retroversion.
Hip anteversion refers to a bony structure where the neck of the femur is rotated anteriorly in the hip socket. This leads to less ability to externally rotate the hip, because the hip joint has run out of room to move in that direction. In fact, excessively anteverted individuals may walk with their toes facing inwards to better line up their femur in the hip socket.
This is measured by taking the angle between the neck of the femur relative to the transcondylar axis of the knee (the horizontal line through the knee in the image above). What‚Äôs classified as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is about 15 degrees, so anything greater is considered anteversion ‚Äì but don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not going to have to measure this angle.
Hip retroversion is the opposite ‚Äì the femoral neck is angled more posteriorly in the hip socket, leading to a reduced ability to internally rotate the hip. Excessively retroverted individuals may walk with a toe-out gait to better position their hip joint during motion.
Confused? I know I was.
Here‚Äôs a minute of me explaining it in plain(er) english.
Let‚Äôs recap.
Everyone‚Äôs hip structure is different ‚Äì so some guys will struggle to move in positions that require more hip internal rotation or relative hip external rotation.
But because extremely hard throwing (and successful) MLB pitchers exist on both ends of the continuum, all hope is not lost if you fall on one end of the spectrum.
It‚Äôs about tailoring your movement and your mechanics to what works best for you (specifically in this case about the strategy you use to laterally drive towards the target).
We‚Äôll leave training for a different article ‚Äì that has been covered in depth by many in the performance world. Anteverted individuals probably won‚Äôt feel comfortable in sumo deadlifts or wide stance squatting, and vice versa. Case in point ‚Äì find the depth, stance and exercises that don‚Äôt create a pinch or bony contact in your hip joint.
For throwing, there‚Äôs no reason we shouldn‚Äôt take the same tinkering approach to figuring out what works best for your hips.
I had a conversation with Eugene Bleecker last month where he brought up this very point ‚Äì some guys not only shouldn‚Äôt, but can‚Äôt throw internally rotated on their back leg. I agree. We had come to the same conclusion independently of one another by noticing that some athletes just don‚Äôt get better if you force them all into the same positions.
So here are three ways to actually address the issue:
Tinker with the foot even with the rubber, turned in about 15-20 degrees, and turned back towards second base about 15-20 degrees. This is a great example of the ‚Äúintelligent tinkering‚Äù strategy. Retroverted guys tend to do best neutral or externally rotated, while anteverted guys (like myself) tend to do best neutral or internally rotated. I‚Äôll actually add a fourth position here as well: hooking the rubber. Testing and gathering both objective and subjective data (what were the #‚Äôs, how did it feel, how repeatable was it, etc.) will help you find your ideal foot and hip position. Just don‚Äôt go too overboard with paralysis by analysis ‚Äì if it‚Äôs comfortable, repeatable and elicits the best numbers, go with it.
Now take a look at some clips of me: turning my back foot slightly inwards in college was actually extremely helpful and I had an almost immediate velocity jump‚Ä¶but this is only possible for me because my structure allows my hips to work well in internally rotated positions.
Remember Athlete A, the guy with awful hip IR? We initially forced roll-ins on him, thinking that it would help him get better separation and improve his efficiency ‚Äì they did for me, and many others, right? Wrong. We spent several months wondering why all of his numbers were down 3-5 mph until we realized that he had lost the hip ER, vertical shin and back leg drive strategy that had always made him successful. Now, he‚Äôs up to 97 in pre-season bullpens, not bad for a 5‚Äô11‚Äù guy with ‚Äútight‚Äù hips. If you find that a more externally rotated femur works for you, actively cue it and reinforce that in your drills.
Case in point: Ben Heller, a big leaguer who regularly tops triple digits, told me that his primary focus in some of his early drill work is to feel the rear hip holding external rotation as he moves forward. I can‚Äôt argue with that. If it works for you, over emphasize that piece of the delivery in all of your drill work to reinforce that pattern.
‚ÄúIf it works for you, over emphasize that piece of the delivery in your drill work to reinforce that pattern.‚Äù
Now, I definitely believe that improving active hip rotation range of motion is important (and likely beneficial) as long as you actually have a tissue restriction. It has been shown that pitchers with reduced hip rotational range of motion put greater external rotation torque on their throwing elbow and have greater horizontal adduction during the follow through (finishing more cross body). But if you‚Äôre pushing to pain, a pinch, bone on bone contact or getting anything but a true stretch, you might be doing more harm than good. One athlete emailed me that he was getting an MRI on BOTH of his hips ‚Äì when he had been healthy two days before (no joke I got the following email):
What¬†did¬†you¬†do? I asked. Turns out he thought that forcing through a painful end range on his hip mobility work would help, and he had given himself impingement symptoms that lasted for about a week.
While there aren‚Äôt any absolutes with how you should position your rear leg during the throwing motion, this is what we‚Äôve noticed with many of the athletes we coach, and may hopefully direct your own mechanical efforts in a productive direction. The biggest takeaway is that you probably shouldn‚Äôt don‚Äôt do strict roll-ins or other extremely internally rotated drills for athletes who can‚Äôt get into those positions.

"The 3 Types of ""Muscling Up"" and How it's Hurting Your Velocity",2019-01-23T17:09:56+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/muscling-up/,"This post goes hand in hand with this youtube video. Give it a watch after completing this article.
Last week we broke down 7 of the top causes of a pushing arm action, so let‚Äôs switch gears this week to discuss another velocity-killing epidemic: commonly known as ‚Äúmuscling up.‚Äù Most of us are familiar with the term, but let‚Äôs unpack it a bit more, and break down both what it is, why it hurts velocity, and several ways you can address it in your own delivery or with the athletes you coach.
To understand ‚Äúmuscling up,‚Äù let‚Äôs briefly revisit the kinetic chain. The kinetic chain is the familiar concept that the body transfers energy segmentally, from one joint to the next, via our system of muscles, ligaments, tendons and fascia. The word kinetic refers to ‚Äúthe motion of material bodies and the forces and energy associated therewith.‚Äù
In this way, each joint is a ‚Äúlink‚Äù in a much larger movement ‚Äúchain.‚Äù
Now, while we can conceptually understand that energy is transferred segmentally, it doesn‚Äôt mean that all the energy from one segment is going to be transferred to the next. In fact, that‚Äôs not even possible, as it has been shown that a portion of the energy transmitted is not just transmitted through the muscle bellies to the tendons to facilitate movement at the next segment, but through fascial connections that link various chains of muscles together in order to do things like regulate posture, reflexively coordinate muscle contractions, and more.
So some energy is going to inevitably be lost at each link in the chain. The goal then, from an efficiency and energy transfer perspective, is to produce as much usable energy as possible while minimizing segmental energy leakage as it gets transferred up the chain.
It‚Äôs not the athlete who laterally bounds furthest off the mound who throws the hardest (although a higher lateral bound correlates with being able to throw harder) ‚Äì maybe he‚Äôs producing the highest lateral ground reaction forces off the rubber, but it becomes unusable energy if it can‚Äôt be sequenced into the bigger chain of events to find its way into the back of the baseball.
This is one reason why you‚Äôll sometimes see smaller or less physically impressive athletes who can still throw fairly (and sometimes exceptionally) hard ‚Äì they might not produce extremely high forces at the segmental level, but they‚Äôre able to seamlessly stitch all of this energy together in a way that minimizes energy leakage.
This is why increasing an athlete‚Äôs squat will only have a potential benefit if they‚Äôre able to tap into that force output in their mechanics and transfer it up the chain. You can squat 600 lbs or jump 40‚Ä≥, but if you don‚Äôt efficiently utilize your lower half while throwing, none of that strength or power will find its way to the baseball. Similarly, a guy who squats 225 lbs but creates maximum use of his leverages and taps into every available muscle fiber is going to throw significantly harder than you might otherwise predict.
Does this make lifting useless? NO! It just means you can only out train poor mechanics to a point, at which athletes will run into a very hard plateau.
Now let‚Äôs revisit this term. Muscling up tends to be thought of in relation to the arm, creating a break in the energy transfer and leading to a loss in velocity from trying to throw harder. While this is one cause and definition, the truth is that muscling up doesn‚Äôt always go hand in hand with trying to throw hard (and it can happen even at low efforts), and that it can happen anywhere in the flow of energy (back leg or hips/low back), not just the arm action.
Muscling up is failure to maintain sufficient relaxation in a given joint segment leading to impaired energy transfer¬†and¬†lower¬†ball¬†velocity.
Consider the following clip of a whip in slow motion, noticing the ‚Äúwave‚Äù of energy working its way down the whip. Now imagine the center of that whip had a portion that was rigid and immovable (like a wooden dowel or metal rod). This is effectively what happens when too much tension is held at various parts of the delivery ‚Äì it leads to an inefficiency in the energy transfer process.
Before we get into the 3 main ways that this muscling phenomenon occurs, let me first be clear: just as being overly tense creates blocks in the wave of energy, 100% relaxation isn‚Äôt optimal either.
Muscles do need a certain amount of base tension to optimally contract and transfer force, and this level of tension is likely individual specific.
I don‚Äôt have an answer as to exactly how much tension is/isn‚Äôt optimal at each segment, because I believe it‚Äôs based on a number of factors (including genetic ones). However, my feeling is that it‚Äôs better to err on the side of being too loose in your mechanics, and add in tension from there based on objective feedback from long toss, radar readings, etc. until you find the balance that elicits the best results.
With the theory behind us, let‚Äôs get practical. Here are the three categories of muscling up I tend to see, and some tips for dealing with each one.
In this post, I discussed how I believe that in a high level delivery the lower half passes through three main phases prior to landing: 1) Drift > 2) drive/pulse > 3) relax into hip rotation.
#1: The drift refers to the leg lift, and how it should begin to subtly initiate forward motion to the target, i.e. no balance points or stalling over the rubber. This sets up the drive/pulse phase.
#2: The drive/pulse phase refers to actively incorporating the rear leg coming down out of leg lift. The ‚Äúpulse‚Äù cue implies that it‚Äôs a temporary drive, not a sustained push that continues all the way into landing, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do #3. This phase is your linear energy towards the target, and doing #1 properly allows you to maximally direct it towards the target.
#3: Relax/rotate into hip rotation refers to the transfer of that linear energy into rotational energy by allowing the rear hip/pelvis to relax open into landing while holding the torso/front shoulder closed.
For the sake of this article, we‚Äôre going to focus on #3: relaxing into hip rotation/landing. I‚Äôve included here the video and my post below it as well, highlighting the relevant section.
‚ÄúDrop and drive‚Äù and ‚Äútall and fall‚Äù are both bad descriptors of 100 mph lower half mechanics. A more accurate description: ‚Äúdrift > drive/pulse > then relax into hip rotation/landing.‚Äù Drop and drive implies a downward first move, which is not the case. Tall and fall implies little rear knee flexion and minimal back leg involvement which is also rarely the case. Drift, pulse, relax most closely mimics the lower half feeling I‚Äôve felt when throwing upper 90s. As a former all arm thrower, let me tell you ‚Äì the turbo boost effect you see from efficient lower halves is real. Holding your available hip abduction until center of mass has been shifted is incredibly important. The timing of the drive/pulse is more important than how hard you push into the ground. Differentiating between the drive phase and the relaxation phase is extremely important. Forget to relax back hip into landing and you can‚Äôt fully separate and capture that linear energy into rotational energy. What‚Äôs interesting is javelin throwers actively cue hanging the back knee into landing because it so clearly improves landing positions, front leg bracing and the ability to transfer that linear momentum through landing.
Here‚Äôs a look at the greatest javelin thrower, Jan Zelezny, relaxing the back leg into rotation.
What‚Äôs notable about Javelin is the fact that they are ‚Äúgifted‚Äù linear momentum from the run up phase of the throw, whereas pitchers create this linear momentum in the drift and drive/pulse phases of the delivery. Still, rotational transfer must occur to convert that linear energy into rotational energy, and so this is where many of the similarities lie.
So what does this look like in practice? Here are two examples of athletes I‚Äôve worked with remotely.
Notice that during this pulldown, he tries to keep driving off his back leg when it lands, even though the linear momentum has already been created. Rather than capturing that energy as in the Zelezny example, he‚Äôs just broken the chain and awkwardly tried to restart the energy transfer by not relaxing the rear hip down and in to landing. His numbers jumped from 86-87 mph to 92-93 the following week once we addressed this issue.
Here‚Äôs another case:
This athlete has been cueing maximal intensity for years, but intent can be a double edged sword if it isn‚Äôt properly sequenced. A hard back leg drive that continues through landing isn‚Äôt a transferrable drive ‚Äì that muscling up of the back leg stops him from creating any dissociation between the upper and lower half.
‚ÄúIntent can be a double edged sword if it isn‚Äôt properly sequenced.‚Äù
He ultimately flies open and pushes the ball, all as a result of not relaxing¬†the¬†back¬†leg¬†into¬†landing¬†after¬†the¬†drive¬†phase.
First off, you can just try explaining the concept and cueing to relax the back hip into landing. Another way of thinking of this is the javelin cue of hanging the back knee down and in to landing to get it ‚Äúout of the way.‚Äù
I‚Äôm sure you still want some drills, though. Anything where you eliminate the drift and drive/pulse phases to focus on the relaxation/rotational transfer phase will help isolate that movement. Pulldowns are one example that drastically improve this ability to transfer a massive amount of linear energy. When guys struggle to transfer pulldowns to the mound it‚Äôs typically not this phase that they struggle with because pulldowns train it well. Of the various pulldown footworks, turn and burns might emphasize this rotation the most, although pick the one that is most comfortable for you.
Beyond pulldowns, here are two more drills to consider. The first is a javelin drill, but it‚Äôs basically a modified rocker starting with the arm up at landing. Do this drill throwing the ball on a line or a slight downhill, not uphill as the javelin thrower here is demonstrating. I‚Äôd also suggest keeping the elbow at a 90 degree bend, not straightened as this thrower is showing. I‚Äôd recommend working up to a 2lb ball at low¬†efforts to feel the drill, then doing the bulk of your reps in the 7oz to 1 lb range, trying to feel the back hip relax and the wave or ‚Äútornado‚Äù of energy wind up the chain into the arm.
The next is a medicine ball throw where the focus is simply on relaxing the back hip down and in to pop the upper half and medicine ball through.
Use a 2 lb ball ‚Äì any heavier may tug on the shoulder from this drill. Again, the focus is still on holding the upper half closed and feeling the wave of energy flow through your body. Notice the smoothness, and also notice what reflexively happens to the front leg ‚Äì it extends and braces very effectively because you‚Äôre allowing the hips to get all the way through, which pulls the front knee into extension.
This is very similar to #1, except that the energy transfer isn‚Äôt being killed by the back hip, but by the low back.
What happens is this very forced rotation where the low back and abdominals take over and tense early, not allowing the energy to continue up the chain. This is often linked to #1 ‚Äì when guys try to spin or rotate their hips open as fast as possible it creates this reflexive tension in the low back (likely a protective mechanism, as I‚Äôll get into in a moment). It has also been shown that hip rotation velocity is not a distinguishing difference between low and high velocity throwers.
Seeing the low back tensing is very difficult ‚Äì it just doesn‚Äôt look like as smooth of a transfer of energy from the hips to the shoulders. It‚Äôs a more ‚Äúblocky‚Äù type of rotation ‚Äì like a boxer trying to power a punch by forcing torso, rather than ‚Äúfloating and stinging,‚Äù as made famous by Muhammad Ali.
Perhaps the best way to describe it is to tell my own story. I injured my back sophomore year of college ‚Äì this was a rotational injury from throwing, stemming from trying to force my hips to rotate as fast as possible, and taking the concept of intent a bit too seriously (I was the slowest thrower on the team but threw my first warm-ups almost as hard as I could). I was mostly an 85-87 guy before the injury.
Coming back from the injury, I was a bit tentative to re-aggravate my low back, so during my rehab throwing I relaxed it and tried to avoid tensing up there as much as possible. After a couple sessions I noticed that the ball was just flying out of my hand (relative to before the injury). I realized that this relaxation was allowing me to transfer energy more smoothly, and ended up coming out the other end of that injury at 88-91 mph almost immediately once I was back to full strength.
I saved this one for last, but it‚Äôs probably the most well known form of muscling up: overly tensing the arm at some point from hand break to ball release, often leading to limited horizontal abduction/scapular retraction, layback and velocity relative to their less aggressive throws.
This tensing issue tends to manifest itself to a greater extent when the athlete tries to throw harder or thinks maximum effort. These guys might warm up at 85% effort, but when you pull out the radar gun and tell them to let it eat, they either throw slower or only marginally faster than their warm-up throws.
‚ÄúWhen you pull out the radar gun, they either throw slower or only marginally faster than their warm-up throws.‚Äù
Sometimes it‚Äôs obvious ‚Äì the patterns visibly change, the throwing arm no longer flips up at landing, the flow of energy loses its smoothness and the glove arm yanks the front side open. Other times, you‚Äôll only know based on seeing the numbers at lower efforts and realizing that there is a break in the chain happening at some point.
In either case, once you have identified the issue, my first step is to reframe what max effort means in a guy‚Äôs head.
Are you trying to throw hard or throw loose and quick?
For some, throwing hard brings up this image of tensing and brute forcing their arm through release, a problem they don‚Äôt have until the radar gun pops out. Switching that frame of reference to trying to throw as loose and quick as possible now makes the focus about arm speed, and can often help guys.
The other cue I will sometimes use is to imagine the ball is on a string, and that string is your arm. Your pec controls the acceleration of that string, not your hand, tricep, etc. This can work as well ‚Äì although if you‚Äôre having trouble cueing them out of a tense arm action, they could be working through some tissue tension issues and need to open up their upper body if they‚Äôre really having trouble relaxing (which we covered in some detail last week).
Worth noting about the second cue is that it entails a focus on proximal over distal ‚Äì thinking about accelerating the arm or pulling down with the pec or ‚Äúarmpit‚Äù allows guys to relax the end of the whip (the hand and forearm).
Here‚Äôs an interesting case study.
Garrett was one of our remote athletes, and his velocity would fluctuate significantly over the course of his starts. In the first inning, his velocity was always at its best ‚Äì touching 90 or 91 miles per hour. The more he threw, the tenser he would get with his arm action, throwing mostly in the 85-87 range after the first inning.
It‚Äôs not that his arm was getting tired ‚Äì but that his body was beginning to revert to its default movement patterns as the upper trap in his case would tense up and prevent his arm from flowing through his arm spiral.
What‚Äôs interesting is that even during the intake process (at 6‚Äô3‚Ä≥ 178lbs), he showed very large and overdeveloped traps. Whether this hypertrophy caused the trap dominance or the trap dominant pattern caused the hypertrophy (more likely), is hard to say, but it was clear that in order to fix his arm action we would need to address the problem in two ways:
#1: Address the tissue quality of the problem area (upper traps), utilizing self myofascial release techniques (video below) and by prescribing he receive manual therapy, ART and/or dry needling on the area.
#2: Cueing him away from upper trap dominant patterns in not just his throwing but all of his rowing, pressing and other weight-room exercises as well.
So what happened?
Garrett not only went from 178 to 194 lbs, bringing up lagging areas in the rest of his body, but went on to be a 91-94 starter who held his velocity deep into games that season.
Here‚Äôs a 93 mph fastball on the last pitch of a no-hitter he threw as a DII Sophomore. Not only was his velocity up, but his velocity maintained deep into games for the first time in his career after addressing the upper trap dominance.
Update: Garrett got up to 96 mph and was drafted in 2019 in the 15th round by the Pirates.
Remember, I am not saying that relaxation is always the key ‚Äì some guys are too loose (my former teammate Mike Shawaryn was one such guy who I would never want to be any looser. Update: he‚Äôs now a big leaguer), but many guys do in fact need to learn how to relax a part of their kinetic chain to elicit more efficient energy transfer.
I don‚Äôt have the magic formula, but hopefully this post gave you some ideas and cues that you can begin to implement with yourself or your athletes. As with everything, don‚Äôt take my word for it: test and retest to determine what works best for each individual.

How to Fix a Pushing Arm Action - 7 Causes and Solutions,2019-01-17T14:24:41+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/7-causes-of-pushing/,"For 2019, our plan is to break down 25-30 of the most common mechanical flaws that we see, and give some insights into how we address them with our athletes. This is by no means an exhaustive list, or to say that these cues or tips will work for every guy, but we‚Äôve had success in implementing these recommendations with our guys.
So today let‚Äôs discuss what is a ‚Äúpushing‚Äù arm action. Pushing, in this case, refers to either one or (often) both of the following:
#1: The elbow getting in front of the line of the shoulders at the point of maximum external rotation, and continuing into release.
#2: A forward flexing of the trunk into ball release, rather than continuing to rotate around the spine through release, leading to a similar tricep driven ‚Äúpush‚Äù into ball release.
Take a look at the pic below of Garrett Richards at maximum external rotation. Notice that he is keeping the elbow in line with the shoulders both top-to-bottom and front-to-back, with the ball laying back perfectly in the plane of shoulder rotation (the plane of rotation is the yellow line connecting his shoulders). If he were pushing, you would see the elbow creeping forward to where the top red ‚ÄòX‚Äô is, which would indicate he was not relaxing the arm into layback and would therefore be forced to utilize his tricep to a much greater extent to extend (push) the elbow into ball release, rather than pulling into horizontal adduction and internal rotation like the vast majority of high level throwers do.
Now let‚Äôs examine forward flexing of the trunk into release. I dug these gifs up from back when I had this issue in high school and was desperately trying to understand it. Notice how in these three MLB‚Äôers continue to rotate around the plane of shoulder rotation (the black line) through release, which is a plane perpendicular to their spinal angle.
Alternatively, this gif from Paul Nyman from over 12 years ago is still one of the best depictions of throwing in the plane of shoulder rotation that I‚Äôve seen.
‚Ä¶.and here was me.
This was back when I threw 73 miles per hour. Notice how my rotation does not occur perpendicular to the spine, and I am finishing the throw via this forward trunk flex. Also notice how this led me (someone with plenty of shoulder external rotation), to not even be able to elicit a full 180 degrees of layback due to the fact that I was not lining that layback up in the right plane of rotation.
So not only does pushing rob you of velocity by limiting your ability to fully utilize your powerful horizontal adductors and internal rotators (triceps instead of pecs/lats), but the most¬†common complaint we see from nearly every athlete who falls into pushing patterns is distal tricep, and sometimes medial elbow pain.
‚ÄúThe most common complaint we see from nearly every athlete who falls into pushing patterns is distal tricep pain.‚Äù
I‚Äôm not saying that fixing this flaw will prevent any and all arm injuries (we all know throwing a baseball hard is playing with a loaded gun, even if you control for all the risk factors as best as possible), just that pushing seems to continually create aches and pains in many athletes who otherwise didn‚Äôt have any before falling into this bad habit.
But what causes a pushing arm action, and is there any way to fix it? Let‚Äôs discuss this very question, with some of the most common causes (and solutions) that we have seen with our athletes.
I first noticed this myself back in 2014 when attempting to go through a standard plyocare routine. In utilizing the 2 and 4 pound plyocare balls, I noticed that my arm was protectively tensing up into layback, not allowing me to relax the anterior shoulder and fire as reflexively from my pecs and lats. Rather, my body‚Äôs default pattern with this load was to shoot the elbow forward and extend the elbow via the tricep to throw the ball.
I‚Äôve seen this phenomenon occur more times than I can count, to where I no longer use a 4 lb ball for throwing for any of my athletes, or a 2 lb ball for youth athletes. Even with older athletes, I still keep an eye on any 2 lb ball throwing they do, and cut it out if I notice they are not able to relax into layback and keep the elbow behind the line of the shoulders at max external rotation.
Heavy balls have their place, as I‚Äôve written about in the past, but you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre going too heavy once a cleaner arm path starts to turn to a pushing arm action.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know you‚Äôre going too heavy once a cleaner arm path starts to turn to a pushing arm action‚Äù
The Solution: be very selective about using ball weights over 1 lb for high school and college aged pitchers (I‚Äôve found that 2 lb is okay for most of these guys at sub-maximal efforts on arm action drills), and avoid 2 lbs or above completely for youth pitchers.
Another common cause for developing this habit on plyocare drills is standing too close to the wall and trying to hit the wall directly in front of your face. This either leads to a cutting action on the ball, a pushing finish to throw throw, or both.
I talk about this in more depth here:
One solution: think about rotating your back shoulder through the target, and let your arm go where it would naturally go to accomplish that (the ball should hit the wall slightly arm side of the target). Consider this screenshot of Jake Arrieta demonstrating this concept below. You can try marking the plyocare wall with a vertical strip of tape and an ‚ÄòX‚Äô. Make sure not to just change your pushing to being in the direction of the ‚ÄòX‚Äô, and actually rotate the shoulders through the target. Additionally, backing up from the wall a few additional feet can help.
This happens at every level, but especially at the youth level. ‚ÄúJust throw strikes‚Äù isn‚Äôt a good cue if athletes‚Äô brains interpret it as I better get as linear as possible and throw darts to make sure coach doesn‚Äôt yell at me again for walking a batter. Keeping a delivery on line is a balance of violent, well-timed rotation that maintains direction towards the target without resorting to forward flexing the trunk and pushing the ball (a low level movement solution to this problem).
One Solution: while there are many possible solutions, and not every athlete will be negatively affected by the strike throwing cue, we‚Äôve seen that long toss is an excellent way to train this. By using the distance constraint, it encourages a rotational, high intent finish (as pushing will lead to noticeably less distance on the throws), while still encouraging these throws to stay on line (as the immediate feedback will be obvious if the ball runs or cuts 20 feet to either side of the target). This immediate feedback and blend of distance and directional constraints all in one is a big reason why long toss is so incredibly effective for many (but not all) athletes.
Another cause of a pushing arm action or linear finish is the inability to keep the torso closed at landing. This leads to a linear finish, which, as we discussed earlier, tends to go hand in hand with a pushing arm action. When the shoulders land completely open, there is nowhere to go with the throw but to finish linearly, as you can see from this following clip of one of our remote athlete‚Äôs original mechanics:
One solution: keeping the shoulders closed at landing and improving hip/shoulder separation is a topic for another post, but suffice it to say that if you can improve that relationship, the arm has a better chance of staying in the proper position during trunk rotation and through ball release. One drill that we use with many of our athletes is the roll in, although we don‚Äôt prescribe it for every athlete primarily due to individual hip anatomical differences.
A particularly tricky cause of a pushing arm action is a mechanical compensation due to a current or prior injury. A number of structures are stressed during trunk rotation, layback and internal rotation into release. For the arm to ‚Äúallow‚Äù this motion to occur and fire through these positions, the brain needs to believe that the tissues will be able to handle these given loads at those specific joint angles. It‚Äôs extremely common that athletes might suffer a bicep tendon, labrum, rotator cuff or medial elbow injury and come back ‚Äúcleared‚Äù to throw but with an altered arm action.
This is more common with athletes who spend a long period of time trying to throw through these injuries or who are rushed back from the injury, as it will be more likely that they are building patterns that compensate around the injury to minimize pain and/or stress to that area. As such, it can be a tough cycle to break once you have built up bad patterns.
One solution: make sure to not progress too fast through rehab protocols or arm rehab drills. Focus on doing them properly, and through full ranges of motion. When you do get back to throwing, focus on the quality of the throws rather than just building up intensity quickly, and if there is a noticeable tissue block, get that addressed before brute forcing your way through the rehab and creating even more bad habits.
Similar to #5, although not necessarily as a result of an injury, tissue restrictions can often create very real limits to the positions a thrower is able to work through. Quite often, pushing arm actions go hand in hand with one of the following areas being overly tight / toned up / dense / fibrotic, listed in our observed order of prevalence:
The pec minor is probably the biggest offender here. Getting in there with targeted manual therapy or partner release work, or working on it solo with a barbell (video further below) can be game changers. Don‚Äôt overlook the subclavius either ‚Äì a sticky one can lock the clavicle down and prevent it from rotating or elevating cleanly to allow scapular posterior tilt (an important part of layback) to take place.
Let‚Äôs take a look at some dynamic movements of the scap (I couldn‚Äôt isolate the throwing motion in this app, regrettably). First, let‚Äôs look at scapular upward rotation, a necessary piece of the arm action (and to get overhead in general).
Notice how the clavicle must elevate in concert with the scapula. The pec minor and subclavius both oppose this motion. If we could see external rotation at 90 degrees of abduction (similar to layback), you‚Äôd see the clavicle must also rotate to allow the scapula to tilt posteriorly during layback.  Next, let‚Äôs look at scapular abduction/adduction (i.e. protraction/retraction). Again, notice how the pec minor (shown) directly opposes retraction.
Keeping these tissues from getting dense, shortened and fibrotic is incredibly important for maintaining a clean, loose arm action (see Yordano Ventura, below).
This is somewhat counterintuitive but we have seen issues where balled-up, tight upper traps were not only leading to the elbow climbing a bit higher than shoulder height during the arm path, but also preventing clean and relaxed layback. This can be addressed with a number of approaches including manual therapy, Self Myofascial Release or SMR (video below) and dry needling. If you are one of these upper trap dominant athletes, this¬†video explains the basics of how to adjust your lifting form to stop reinforcing this pattern.
These two muscles can also create some issues as far as instigating a pushing arm action. Both are placed on stretch at max external rotation, so being overly tight in either area can prevent the elbow from staying back in the line of the shoulders.
More importantly, the lats should be addressed from a tissue quality standpoint as it can lead to poor scapular movement as well. We use a number of specific partner and self myofascial release drills with our remote athletes to address these two areas in particular.
You can see a few of the self-myofascial release options we use with our remote athletes below:
Sometimes, athletes want so bad to force layback that they actually end up pushing the ball. From the side, a pushing arm action gets the forearm horizontal and would falsely appear to be reaching 180 (or more) degrees of layback.
Unfortunately, this layback is actually elbow flexion masquerading as layback/external rotation, which is why this tends to not lead to measurable improvements in performance when an athlete ‚Äúgains‚Äù layback in this way.
One solution: rather than forcing external rotation and layback to occur by shooting the elbow forwards, try targeting the surrounding soft tissues that can contribute to poor layback (as outlined in #6). The degree of layback does have some genetic components as well as being related to having a throwing history in childhood (which creates humeral retroversion) and lends itself to more external rotation as well.
This is by no means an exhaustive list on what can lead to a pushing arm action, but it‚Äôs a decent start. Take some time to evaluate yourself (or your pitching staff) for this mechanical flaw, and work to clean up the underlying cause once you identify what it is. While some athletes can reach relatively high levels of the game with an extreme pushing arm action, it becomes exceedingly rare at the higher levels. Give these tips a try and, as always, email us if you have any questions.

3 New Ways to Use J-Bands for Arm Health and Velocity,2019-01-09T16:08:57+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/j-band-exercises/,"Jaeger bands have become a staple in baseball warm-ups around the country over the last 10 years ‚Äì from youth travel teams to Division I college programs, their ease of use and versatility have made them massively popular.
Jaeger bands have become a staple in baseball warm-ups around the country over the last 10 years ‚Äì from youth travel teams to Division I college programs, their ease of use and versatility have made them massively popular.
Still, 99% of how they are used is in the exact manner they are marketed ‚Äì dynamic repetitions of a variety of upper body movements (like rows, presses, diagonal raises and external rotations), in order to prep the arm for throwing. The logic is sound ‚Äì and just as dynamic warm-ups for the lower extremity are a no-brainer prior to sprinting, it makes similar sense to pump blood into the muscles, stimulate those motor units, begin to activate the nervous system, and help lubricate the synovial joints by taking them through full ranges of motion.
From a warm-up standpoint, few would argue that light resistance bands aren‚Äôt a convenient way to achieve these goals, even with other options available that similarly fit the bill (light dumbbells, shoulder tube, wrist weights, etc).
Over the past 10+ years of incorporating J-bands into my own warm-ups, I‚Äôve recently begun to incorporate several new approaches to J-bands, beyond the light, rapid-fire dynamic warm-up methodology.
Without further ado, here are three novel ways to incorporate J-bands into your training and arm care routine.
J-bands (and bands in general) are just a form of resistance. As such, it intrigues me that people place a huge distinction between the ‚Äúwarm-up‚Äù benefits of J-bands and the ‚Äúscapular strengthening‚Äù benefits of Crossover Symmetry band. Indeed, the main difference lies in the application of this resistance, as either of these bands could be used for warm up or strengthening purposes.
Warm-Up: Light resistance, not taken to the point of muscular fatigue/failure, achieve full ROM
Strengthening: Moderate / heavy resistance, fatigue inducing, achieve full ROM
However, let‚Äôs take what we know about strengthening muscles a step further. A given muscle is approximately 25-50% stronger on the eccentric (negative) phase of the movement than on the positive (concentric) phase. Nevertheless, most shoulder strengthening movements are done using the same load on both the concentric and eccentric phases, effectively missing out on muscle fiber recruitment during the negative phase of the lift.
Not only has it been consistently shown that eccentric strength training leads to improved strength and hypertrophy across a wide range of movements (and muscles), but the very muscles that J-bands tend to focus on are decelerators in the throwing motion meaning they will be asked to fire eccentrically during the throwing motion. Because muscles like the posterior cuff and low trapezius must work hard during deceleration to slow down shoulder internal rotation and scapular anterior tilt, it makes eccentric training especially relevant for throwers.
Furthermore, eccentric training has been shown to reduce the risk of muscle strains, at least as it relates to sprinting and hamstring strains. How? The answer, as laid out in this research review, lies in improving the ratio of eccentric to concentric strength. In other words, just doing normal reps grants a disproportionate gain in concentric strength throughout your body without proportionally strengthening the eccentric portion of the movement. It makes logical sense, then, that if your accelerators out-develop your brakes as an athlete, you are at a higher risk of injury, and vice versa. What eccentric training does, over time, is to increase the ratio of your brakes relative to your accelerators, ensuring that you‚Äôre going to be producing forces that your body is sufficiently equipped to decelerate.
While there are many techniques to overload the eccentric phase of a movement, we‚Äôre going to focus on two ways of doing this with bands:
For the first way of overloading the eccentric, you‚Äôll be backing up to a resistance that you can‚Äôt quite finish the positive phase of the rep on your own, and you‚Äôll use your off arm to take some tension out of the band at the end range of the movement ‚Äì just¬†enough to allow you to hit the limits of your available range of motion. Now: still activating the target muscles properly, remove the assisting arm and let that extra band tension pull your back to the starting position, resisting the¬†entire¬†way. By using more resistance than you would otherwise be able to use, you‚Äôll be overloading the eccentric, and by assisting yourself on the concentric you‚Äôll still reach full range on the concentric, creating a near-perfect strength curve (for perfect strength curves, meaning that there is maximal muscle fiber recruitment throughout the entire range of motion of the exercise, requires manual resistance, which is less practical and I‚Äôll have to touch on in another article).
For the eccentric-only method, you‚Äôll take the band without any resistance and position your arm and shoulder at the end range of the movement. From here, brace in an isometric contraction and step back until the band begins to force the eccentric to begin. By focusing on a perfect, unloaded starting position, you can reinforce strength in your weakest and most vulnerable nooks and crannies.
Take a look here at these movements in action:
Suggested¬†use:¬†post-throwing, 2-3x¬†per¬†week
Rather than incorporating overloaded eccentrics pre-throwing, when you least want to fatigue out the rotator cuff and dynamic stabilizers of the shoulder, sprinkle in a couple sets throughout the week post-throwing.
Day 1 ‚Äì Assisted concentric
-Band Ys & T‚Äôs: 2-3 x 10 reps
-Band External Rotations: 2-3 x 10 reps
-Reverse throwing pattern: 2-3 x 10 reps
Day 3 ‚Äì Eccentric only
-Band Ys & T‚Äôs: 2-3 x 10 reps
-Band Face Pull with External Rotation: 2-3 x 10 reps
-Reverse throwing pattern: 2-3 x 10 reps
Day 5 ‚Äì Assisted concentricBand Ys & T‚Äôs: 2-3 x 10 reps
-Band External Rotations: 2-3 x 10 reps
-Reverse throwing pattern: 2-3 x 10 reps
Caution: if you‚Äôre already doing targeted eccentric shoulder and scap training in the weight room, adding in more eccentrics may be overkill. Take this recommendation within the context of an athlete‚Äôs overall program and how he is recovering.
One of the biggest challenges for baseball coaches is the complexity of motor learning and skill acquisition. How do you fundamentally change how an athlete moves? Is there a tissue or joint block preventing proper mechanics? Should you use internally or externally focused cues? How do you re-write tens of thousands of improperly done repetitions without making the athlete hyper-aware of their movements and become robotic through their new patterns?
As such, I‚Äôm always keeping a lookout for new or existing tools to address some of the more common and stubborn movement flaws we see in our athletes. Medicine balls, Indian clubs and even dumbbells have fallen victim to some of these low load patterning ideas ‚Äì and J-bands are no exception.
There are two main ways so far that I‚Äôve begun to incorporate bands for patterning purposes (and I‚Äôm sure there will be more in the future). These are:
For this drill, the purpose is to re-program from square one how front leg bracing occurs. Rather than slamming into landing on the front foot and extending via the quad forcibly contracting to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the leg into extension, this drill teaches how to feel the front leg being ‚Äúpulled‚Äù into extension as hip rotation is completed. By encouraging athletes to feel full hip rotation occur, front leg bracing is an inevitable byproduct.
I separate this drill, which I call an ipsilateral (same side) row, into four progressions:
Check out these progressions in the video below:
Suggested use: 5 minutes daily as part of your J-band warm-up series
This progression for the front leg feeds very well into this next medicine ball drill, a dynamic version of the same pattern. We‚Äôll dive deeper into this in a different article but I‚Äôll leave this video here for you to chew on.
I‚Äôll prescribe this drill, which I call band throws, to an athlete‚Äôs J-band warm-up if I determine they are pushing the elbow forward into release and aren‚Äôt responding to a number of throwing related cues that we‚Äôve used to try to fix the issue. This drill forces the arm to ‚Äúlag‚Äù behind the shoulders, initiating a stretch of the pectorals and preventing any pattern besides ‚Äúpulling‚Äù the humerus forward from behind the midline of the body into horizontal adduction and internal rotation. As such, this is part of the groundwork for reprogramming a tricep-driven ‚Äúpushing‚Äù arm action.
It‚Äôs worth noting that sometimes pushing occurs because the front side opens so early that there is no way for the arm to take this efficient path into release ‚Äì as such, improving the ability to segment the lower half and keep the front shoulder closed at front foot strike can also improve symptoms of pushing.
*I believe this is very similar (albeit with a different intent) to a drill from Ron Wolforth‚Äôs Combat Pitcher DVD. Credit to Ron if you‚Äôre the one who came up with the original version of this drill.
Full Video Explanation:
Suggested use: 2 sets of 10 reps daily as part of your regular J-band warm-up
This drill also pairs really well with medball wall dribbles (video below). Try to take the tricep out of it and ‚Äúpull‚Äù into release via internal rotation.
The purpose of low-load isometrics (gently pressing statically against resistance), as prescribed in many rehabilitation programs, is to reinforce the neurological communication or ‚Äúactivation‚Äù of the muscles that control a given joint position, without significantly loading the movement. These are typically done at extreme joint angles, which are often neglected in training programs. Reinforcing control of ‚Äúdelicate‚Äù or ‚Äúend-range‚Äù positions (such as max external rotation or maximum horizontal abduction) where clean arthokinematics and muscle recruitment are extremely important, can be a useful addition for non-injured athletes as well.
Taking the joint into its nooks and crannies and holding those positions (versus just bouncing through them quickly), forces an improved proprioceptive connection between the brain and that specific joint angle.
This can be considered the pre-cursor to actually loading these end range positions more intensely, as seen in the PAILs/RAILs methodology and Functional Range Conditioning (FRC). Still, making sure to reinforce that neurological connection at several important joint angles makes logical sense to me, and so I‚Äôve incorporated several of these rehabilitation movements into my regular J-band routine as a form of pre-hab.
The 3 joint angles I chose to reinforce in my warm-up are as follows:
Check it out in this video below:
Because these are non-fatiguing contractions, there‚Äôs no apparent downside to adding them in to your warm-up, and, anecdotally, they do seem to make you much more comfortable in these extreme or ‚Äúdelicate‚Äù positions that you are asking your arm to ballistically fire through on a regular basis. Gaining proprioceptive control over these positions, even if you don‚Äôt take it to the maximum effort extent of FRC, is a sensible step to take.
Standard J-Band routines do work if the goal is to do a general dynamic warm-up for the upper extremity ‚Äì but these three applications both fill in the gaps from a warm-up standpoint and provide additional inspiration for applying this tool from a patterning and strengthening standpoint as well.

Rethinking Periodization: Principles of Energy in Training Organization,2018-12-28T18:47:59+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/rethinking-periodization/,"This article was originally published here, and has been re-published with Kevin‚Äôs permission.
Periodization is the water that all training is dissolved in. Without it, training is just exercise. Yet, it seems that we‚Äôve come to a bit of a roadblock in terms of taking the next step forward in organizing training for athletic performance.
The big-picture problem with periodization is this: There are so many great concepts that have overlapped and intertwined into a mess of technicalities and contingencies that make the field of sports performance look like an ugly cousin of rocket science.
Even more specifically, it seems that the rationale for any given periodization scheme revolves around the same few concepts: stress response curves, CNS management, and muscular/tendon adaptations.
This is fine, BUT,¬†there is so much more to sports performance.
So what is it that we‚Äôre leaving out? And more importantly,¬†why?
We all learned the difference between these two concepts at some point in our middle school science classes. We learned that¬†quantitative measurements are number-based, and in most cases, the most objective form of result that can be obtained.
The qualitative measurement then is description based, requires a level of interpretation, and is considered less concrete. In many cases, we‚Äôre told that it is less useful than numbers-based results.
In the field of sports performance, we are hammered with the concept of progressive overload (which is inherently quantitative), ideas like ‚Äúwhat gets measured gets improved,‚Äù as well as the visual and personal satisfaction that comes with seeing more plates stacked on the barbell.
But what becomes a bit mind-blowing to think about is that there is math, numbers, equations, and quantity associated with¬†everything,¬†including ‚Äúqualitative‚Äù descriptions:
Just because we don‚Äôt know how to measure something¬†doesn‚Äôt mean that there isn‚Äôt a quantity of¬†something¬†associated with it, and it definitely does not make it any less important.
Quantitative measurement is the gold standard in this field. But by becoming so quantitatively driven, we are actually dumbing down the intrinsic complexity of Mother Nature to only what we can see and understand.
Meaning: If something is ‚Äúqualitative‚Äù it just means we do not yet understand how to make it ‚Äúquantitative‚Äù yet. By focusing so heavily on what we¬†can¬†measure (1 rep maxes, sets, reps, bar velocities, muscle activation, etc.), we are ignoring a huge chunk of human movement that is yet to be fully understood (energy, rotation, waveform principles, fascia, functional anatomy).
Building off the last point, it seems that we blame genetics any time we do not fully understand where performance (or lack thereof) is coming from.
How many times have we heard about the ‚Äúgenetic freak‚Äù that can‚Äôt squat his bodyweight but can out jump every athlete in the gym? ¬†Or the guy who ‚Äúlost the genetic lottery‚Äù and just can‚Äôt tolerate carbs? I‚Äôve blamed my body type for my inability to run correctly more times than I care to admit.
Genetics are a blueprint, not a destiny.¬†We know so much about the power of epigenetics and the power of exercise, nutrition, lifestyle factors, brain plasticity, and the massive web of interactions between the infinite variables within that give our minds, bodies, and spirit¬†a massive capacity for change.
We have the knowledge and resources to overcome everything from lack of mobility, poor body composition, psychological roadblocks, poor sleep, and any other barrier to success. With so many potential factors in performance, let‚Äôs look beyond genetics.
New perspectives, outside the box thinking, and questioning assumptions are the only way to break out of the box.
Perhaps the most underappreciated concept in sports performance, energy is the universal language of motion.¬†Energy links together EVERYTHING in sport and movement:
We assimilate chemical energy from the food we eat. We then transform this chemical energy into mechanical energy through muscular contractions. Our system of fascia and tendons has a huge amount of elastic potential energy that can be transformed into kinetic energy by utilizing gravitational potential energy.
Our bodies are incredible vessels for energy transformation, all the way down to the molecular level. ¬†On top of all that, energy is hiding within every bigger picture biomechanics and physics concept you could think of:
Kinetic Energy = ¬Ω * mass * velocity2
Momentum = mass * velocity
(Momentum and KE are both based on mass and velocity, and are intimately linked in how we move)
Force = Mass * Acceleration = Mass * Change in velocity/ change in time
(Force measures change in momentum and energy¬†in a collision)
There are so many other places that energy is hiding, but these examples show that¬†energy, mass, velocity, time and collisions are all linked.
As I wrote about previously, we often look at movement as how the body must¬†overcome¬†the forces of Mother Nature. We talk about movement in terms of muscles and force.
But at its very core, the foundation of movement is not force, mobility, or raw horsepower of the nervous system.¬†The foundation of movement is an intuitive understanding of how the human body can work in synergy with the laws of physics.¬†How can an athlete manipulate the world around them and the levers within to work¬†with them¬†rather than¬†against them?
Looking at human movement from the perspective of energy, we‚Äôll find ourselves coming back to a new set of fundamentals of movement. By looking at the basic aspects of functional anatomy (instead of training ‚Äúrules‚Äù) in relation to the principal laws of physics¬†(instead of training-based measurements), we can organize training in a light that will set athletes up for more consistent adaptation, better transfer to sport, and that will allow us to find adaptations that are currently viewed as ‚Äúgood genetics.‚Äù
Why is it that some athletes respond better to certain training schemes than others?
The obvious answer is that every athlete will have a unique starting point of posture, muscle strengths and weaknesses, and genetics. But what¬†exactly¬†are these differences that allow for better adaptation?
Every exercise has two sides to it: the physical demands being imposed, and the athlete‚Äôs unique anthropometry that is receiving the stress. To break this down even further, we can say that every exercise is a collision (barbell on athlete‚Äôs back, athlete‚Äôs feet hitting the ground, etc.) that¬†sets off a chain reaction of internal collisions at each respective joint within the body.¬†These collisions are the pathway that energy travels.
From this frame of reference, a squat is not just a squat, a jump not just a jump, and a sprint not just a sprint: the resulting pathway of¬†internal collisions¬†will depend on many factors including weight distribution on feet, shape of feet, mobility restrictions, muscle/tendon integrity, limb angles, etc.
But while it is true that every athlete will have a unique starting point for his or her training,¬†we all have the same basic template of joint-to-joint energy transfer.
That is, we all have feet, ankles, knees, hips, a spine, and shoulders that move and function in the¬†same exact manner. Every hip is a ball and socket joint. Every knee is a hinge. Every ankle can pronate, supinate, plantarflex, and dorsiflex.
While we have no way to quantify it, the human body will generally have an optimal way to sequence any given movement based on the intrinsic system of levers it provides.
As described in the previous section, the series of internal collisions that occur through movement can be considered the pathway of energy transfer.
Energy transfer will depend on two major components:¬†posture and stiffness.
Posture can be thought of as the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the body at any given point in movement. Stiffness can be thought of as how well the body is ‚Äúglued together‚Äù in these positions. The key though is that any given movement will need mobility through specific joints, and stability through certain joints.
We want to utilize the relative mobility and stiffness at each joint¬†to load and unload our body‚Äôs fascial lines to transfer energy.¬†Fascia allows for passive, elastic transfer of energy.
It‚Äôs this utilization of the passive nature of fascial pathways that allow elite athletes to make performance look so easy. Watch the level of relaxation in the World Record performances of javelin, triple jump, and 100-meter dash.
What is it that allows these athletes to tap into the fascial pathways so naturally? ¬†The answer lies in the interaction between the feet, hips, and spine.
To start,¬†our feet are our connection to the ground, and the starting point of the internal chain reaction of collisions¬†that occur in natural (i.e. without barbells on our backs) movement.
Foot posture or the shape of the foot will play a huge role in where the energy travels through the rest of the body.
The foot has three arches:¬†Medial¬†(heel to first metatarsal),¬†Lateral¬†(heel to fifth metatarsal), and¬†Transverse¬†(first to fifth metatarsal). These arches are created from tension through the muscles in the lower leg/ankle. Depending on how strong these lower leg muscles are,¬†a person can have zero, one, or three arches that are utilized in movement, which all contribute to tension through the posterior chain fascial pathway.
Depending on how strong these lower leg muscles are, a person can have zero, one, or three arches that are utilized in movement.
One of the major factors in efficient energy transfer through the foot is to be able to put force into the ground through the 4th/5th¬†metatarsals (the outside ball of foot).
In movement, the foot should contact the ground at the 4th/5th¬†metatarsal and roll from supination to pronation. This ‚Äúrolling‚Äù action creates a smooth and efficient transfer of energy¬†through all three arches¬†into the Achilles and allows for the hip to internally rotate.
The foot-hip relationship is where the magic happens in elite performance. Consider the pathway of internal collisions that is initiated at ground contact:
This creates massive tension through posterior chain: The shin is being pushed forward at the knee from the momentum of the body‚Äôs COM while the femur is being drawn back by the glute, creating massive eccentric tension through the hamstring. On top of that the Achilles is working against the forward shin movement, while the glutes drive movement and the lower abs activate to hold the pelvis level.
This whole sequence of events happens naturally and reflexively as a function of the tensegrity and motion of the body‚Äôs system of joints and levers. This pathway creates massive vertical forces that are mostly passive (elastic in nature; without neural drive) and allows the body to maintain its horizontal momentum.
When the feet lack stiffness, or the hips aren‚Äôt mobile, the energy will take a pathway that is less intrinsic to the function of the body (e.g. Heel striking in running sends energy through bones and joints instead of fascia; lack of hip IR limits hip flexion, leads to QL compensation and locks up the spine).
The spine also plays a huge role in energy transfer. I wrote previously about¬†how the stretching and contracting of our soft tissue structures can be considered waves of energy. Human movement occurs as a direct result of the relationship between our body stretching away from its resting state and the system of joints and levers that transfer these waves of energy from the ground to our center of mass.
While the location of center of mass will vary depending on individual anthropometry,¬†the lumbopelvic complex could be considered the ‚Äúcenter of movement.‚Äù¬†This is where all movement and waves of energy will ultimately oscillate around and away from.
In addition, the spine as a whole plays an important role in energy transfer through waveform principles. Consider what happens at the spine during the arm swing of a jump.
Two big takeaways:¬†First is this creates a wave of movement from the feet through the spine. It‚Äôs very subtle in fast movement, but if you slow it down and exaggerate the motion, you will see and feel the wave.
Second is that timing this properly creates stiffness through motion: The T-spine flexion drives the chest and arms into the loading phase of the jump, but as soon as the stretch shortening cycle begins unloading the chest and arms now moving¬†with¬†the jump into T-spine extension and shoulder flexion. This allows for full body elasticity rather than just relying on the legs to jump.
With the background and perspective of energy in athletic movement, there are several key principles that lead to a logical sequence of training organization.
First we have to look at programming individual exercises not based on what is ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù happen, but¬†rather on the¬†exact¬†mechanism by which it will improve energy transfer through movement.¬†¬†Specific joint mobility, relative muscle stiffness, neurofascial remodeling, timing, and sequencing are all great reasons for programming an exercise.
Strength, power, hypertrophy, flexibility, stability, etc. are all¬†too general¬†of terms to be utilized with any consistent effectiveness.
We also have to understand¬†just how important movement capacity is in athletic movement and energy transfer. The fact is that in any sport, technique can only be as good as what the body is physically capable of doing. You can‚Äôt cue your way out of mobility restrictions.
In any sport, technique can only be as good as what the body is physically capable of doing. You can‚Äôt cue your way out of mobility restrictions.
And if we continue training through mobility restrictions,¬†what qualities are you reinforcing?¬†Bad posture? Inefficient sequencing?
To take this idea a step further, maximizing movement capacity is the adaptation that drives adaptation. As an example: Jan Zelezny (World Record javelin thrower) had a very high volume of running in his program. Does this mean that running is the key to throwing far?
Well,¬†how are your feet? How is your foot contact?¬†Does your running technique access the frontal and transverse planes? Do you have adequate hip internal rotation?
Jan Zelezny had all of these.¬†This meant that every step he took in running reinforced great movement habits.¬†If you have flat feet, heel strike every ground contact, and are locked in the sagittal plane, running will destroy you. Each step would reinforce awful movement habits, and slowly bring you closer to injury.
The key though, is that¬†you can attain these exact attributes that allowed Zelezny to feed off this running volume.
This should be the first step in every athlete‚Äôs training. Train to become athletic. Strengthen the arches in your feet. Train to put force through the 4th/5th¬†metatarsal (the most overlooked aspect of athleticism; ankle sprains become a vicious feedback loop because they both cause and are caused by weakness through plantarflexed supination). Improve capsular rotation at hip (internal rotation is a mobility restriction of epidemic proportion). Improve spinal segmentation (trees have trunks, you have vertebrae).
I mentioned the ideas of¬†timing and sequencing. Looking at movement as a chain reaction of collisions helps us understand the importance of this concept.
As a simple example, think about the swinging of your arms while walking. What happens if you consciously change which arm goes forward with each leg?
You‚Äôve changed the timing in such a way that you‚Äôve removed the collisions that create the stretching/un-stretching oscillations through the frontal and transverse planes in the lats, hips, spine, and shoulders.
The body moves as series of interconnected arcs, circles, rotations, and ‚Äúfigure 8‚Äôs.‚Äù There is a very specific synergy that allows this to happen, and¬†any interruption of the synergy means energy gets lost as waves of energy cancel each other out¬†(see: destructive vs. constructive waves)
These interruptions can come in the form of mobility restrictions, muscular imbalances, or poor timing of joints within movement (which could be a symptom of either of the previous points).
An important point to remember here is that our unconscious brains know energy best.¬†Our cerebellum will always find the most practical way to move, but it often requires us to let go of how we ‚Äúthink‚Äù we‚Äôre supposed to move (i.e. excessive/wrong coaching cues). Timing and sequencing then need to be very¬†carefully and intentionally¬†programmed into training.
This is where the next step of training for energy should come into play.¬†It‚Äôs the integration of the newly acquired movement capacity into faster, more efficient, more powerful movement sequencing.
The big keys here are the rolling action of the foot from supination to pronation, utilization of adduction in movement (frontal plane energy transfer), integration of spine in movement (think arms in jumping; utilization of lower lats David Weck style), and angles of collisions. If you are not familiar with the work of Adarian Barr, I highly recommend you learn his concepts of ‚Äúinside edge,‚Äù ‚Äúflap,‚Äù foot-path in running, and ‚Äúconscious to unconscious.‚Äù¬†Very few people are talking about energy in athletic preparation, and he is one of them.
I find many of Ido Portal‚Äôs drills to be very effective here: duck walks, spinal waves in various positions, ‚Äúdead arm‚Äù circles (where hips and spine move completely relaxed arms through big shoulder circles), and his crawling exercises.
I also find that with the right cues, a completely inward focus (i.e. quality vs quantity focused), and no physical restrictions, running in all of its forms is an amazing drill to learn proper movement.
The last step of training for energy transfer would be the¬†integration of all of these ideas into sport specific movement.¬†This will be completely individual depending on the sport, position, etc., but the concepts behind energy transfer are universal.
The beauty behind the idea of energy transfer in periodization is that it does not complicate training to any degree. In fact, I would argue it simplifies the process:
Taking these ideas into consideration, it gives us a logical progression of training through the year not based on sets, reps, numbers, seasons, and cycles, but rather on¬†how¬†movement is occurring.
What‚Äôs also important is that this is merely a new foundation that many of the ideas we currently utilize can stand on. Concepts such as cueing, layering movement patterns, muscle and tendon adaptations, CNS fatigue, and stress responses¬†are still massively important.
These are extremely wide scope principles that have a ton of room for individualization, adaptation, and further expansion.

Problem Solving Your Lower Half Pitching Mechanics to Throw Harder,2018-05-10T02:15:53+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/back-leg-mechanics/,"I wanted to give my take on a very common question we get from our athletes: how the hell do you learn to use your back leg?¬†This is something I struggled with FOREVER, and held me back quite a bit in my career because I had no idea how to initiate motion towards the target and be able to transfer that into the upper half. Here are some of the biggest tips, cues and drills that have worked for me. I hope you find this useful.
Enjoy!
‚Äî
Q: I have a hard time using my lower half when I throw. I really don‚Äôt know how to drive with my back leg. I think the main reason is that whenever I try to drive my back leg, the momentum of my back leg tends to go up instead of going to the direction I throw, so I lose a lot of power. How do I fix this?
This is something I struggled with for a long time as well. After finally learning to use my back leg (which really means learning to shift my weight properly) I jumped from 87-90 (t92) to 90-94 (t95). From that slide-step delivery, I then learned how to transition this even further to a full leg lift, and this got me to 96-97 (t98) in bullpens. I have had a strength base and good mobility for a long time, but it was¬†learning how to transfer energy from the lower half and shift my weight properly that saw these massive spikes in velocity.
So here are the 3 things that helped me the most in regards to learning to properly use the lower half and, specifically, the back leg:
‚Äî
The quadriceps muscle action is to forcefully extend the knee which will drive your center of mass upwards if that happens too early. Focusing on moving forward from the rear glute is a good first step ‚Äì the quad will still activate, but that should not be the focus. It‚Äôs much more of a secondary isometric contraction that occurs during the drive phase, not the primary concentric contraction.
Even the poster boy for the ‚Äúdrop and drive,‚Äù crowd, Carson Fulmer (below), isometrically sits into his quad while gaining this forward motion from the glutes and hamstrings to¬†extend¬†and¬†abduct¬†the hip. Much like efficient sprinters don‚Äôt push the ground away from them, but rather,¬†pull¬†the ground backwards via the glutes/hamstrings, the most efficient pitchers incorporate this action into the frontal plane.¬†Think ‚Äúclawing‚Äù or ‚Äúpulling‚Äù the rubber back towards second base, not ‚Äúpushing‚Äù or ‚Äúlunging‚Äù off of it.¬†You can also look at it as pulling yourself towards the target, if that creates a better picture in your mind.
Even Carson Fulmer doesn‚Äôt rely on the quads as his main source of power.
‚Äî
What I mean by this is that if you want the lower half to drive horizontally and open into landing and the upper half to stay back and closed at landing, one strategy that worked for me is to set your position at peak leg lift to be the reverse of this movement. This means coiling the hips back against the upper half, which results in the unloading in the opposite direction as you come out of peak leg lift.
Roger Clemens is a good example of this. The upper and lower halves work against each other during the leg lift which sets up this smooth lateral and rotational unloading of energy.
Clemens turns and laterally tilts his torso against the hips, effectively coiling the spring.
So the back leg isn‚Äôt actively pushing down the mound, it‚Äôs better to think about it as ‚Äúcatching and accelerating‚Äù the center of mass via this ‚Äúclawing/pulling‚Äù action. By the time you do get into the back leg, your center of mass should already be shifted such that you feel a sensation of hitting the ‚Äúturbo boost‚Äù or ‚Äúroller coaster.‚Äù
Muscling your center of mass towards the plate from over the rubber is not an efficient way to transfer energy, and starting pitchers wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that while maintaining their stuff for 100+ pitches if they were doing max effort lateral jumps.
Bartolo Colon wouldn‚Äôt still be pitching if he didn‚Äôt shift his mass effectively, because the amount of energy it would take to overcome that inertia would, quite frankly, be unsustainable. This is another reason many pitchers can get away with having a little excess ‚Äúvelo pouch‚Äù and a 15 inch vertical jump but can still throw very hard if they utilize their body efficiently on the mound. Once you‚Äôve gotten the train moving, THEN it‚Äôs time to apply force from the rear glute/hamstring.
To feel this, I recommend drills that start with your center of mass out front where you have to shift your weight back into your rear leg. Again, we‚Äôre using the idea of pre-loading the opposite of the pattern we want to create. Stepping back into the drill loads up the muscles in the exact opposite direction¬†of how we want to use them, so from there it‚Äôs just a matter of reversing the movement from the back leg.
Examples of drills that accomplish this are:
Again, these are just some suggestions that worked for me.
And remember ‚Äì the spine (and body) is built to transfer energy smoothly and segmentally.¬†Try to feel smooth and fluid going through these drills¬†‚Äì don‚Äôt stomp down on the back leg and immediately jerk forward ‚Äì you should ramp up through these drills feeling like ‚Äúthe ball is throwing itself‚Äù or ‚Äúthe arm is along for the ride,‚Äù until you get up over 50% intensity.¬†If you can get up in the 70s before actively applying any effort from your arm, you know you‚Äôre sequencing well. When I can throw low 80s during warm-ups (50%) feeling like my lower half is throwing the ball with absolutely zero effort from my arm, that‚Äôs when I know my sequencing is down and that I have 15+ mph left in the tank that day.
I wanted to include a couple more examples for you guys to see. There are countless MLB examples as well, but check out Matt Mercer (top, up to 100 mph) and me (bottom) to see how the leg lift sets up the lower half actions.¬†Tim Lincecum¬†when he threw 100 in college is another classic example, although he lost this dynamic lower half over the years.
At the end of the day, there are a lot of ways to teach and cue lower half actions. This is what worked for me, although keep in mind I‚Äôd had 7 years of coaches trying to teach the lower half with Towel drills, poorly cued Rocker drills and Hershiser drills, so take that for what it‚Äôs worth.
Good luck implementing these tips and here‚Äôs to reaching your potential!

The Top 12 Reasons For Velocity Fluctuations (part 2),2018-03-07T23:41:25+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/velocity-fluctuation-pt2/,"This article is¬†part two of a two part series on reasons an athlete‚Äôs velocity might fluctuate in-season.¬† (Note:¬† These factors contribute to off-season fluctuations as well.)¬† Check out part one¬†here.
‚Äî
There is evidence that trying to peak within the first 4 hours after waking, specifically early in the morning and when athletes haven‚Äôt been accustomed to such early competition, may significantly reduce performance.
Scientists have suggested this may be linked to core body temperature, which takes time to build up to optimal levels after waking. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs linked to the following factor as well ‚Äì physiological arousal. Don‚Äôt be surprised if your velocity is down a couple ticks if you throw an early morning game or bullpen into the mix ‚Äì this is relatively normal.
‚Äî
Higher arousal kicks us towards the sympathetic nervous system (the fight-or-flight response), which involves a hormonal cascade that increases adrenaline and cortisol, raising heart rate and potentially motor unit recruitment. Think yelling and smashing a beer can against your forehead or getting a slap on the back before a big lift.
Lower arousal shifts us the opposite direction, towards the parasympathetic nervous system (the ‚Äúrest-and-digest response‚Äù), which slows the heart rate and allows for more control over fine motor tasks. Think taking a deep breath with a slow exhale.
A key takeaway here is that different tasks require different levels of arousal for peak performance, but there is a bell curve relationship where both too little and too much arousal will reduce performance.
The Arousal vs. Performance bell curve
Rolling out of bed and yawning before you throw isn‚Äôt optimal, and neither is pounding 7 red bulls so that you can‚Äôt think or relax enough to repeat your delivery.
If your arousal is shifting all the time ‚Äì afternoon vs night games, scouts vs. no scouts in the stands, home vs. away ‚Äì this can often explain fluctuations in velocity.
Each guy is different too in what level of arousal works for them ‚Äì the intensity of ‚ÄòMad Max‚Äô Scherzer (shown below) vs. the focus of Dallas Keuchel, for example. The point here is to know yourself ‚Äì which takes time, and once you‚Äôve determined what the optimal level of arousal is for you, work to replicate that psychological, and in turn, physiological response each time.
Many guys gear up for scout day, hit a new high velocity, and then fail to ever get themselves into that mental state for scrimmages or bullpens, scratching their head why they can never peak like that again. In these types of cases, lower arousal may be a culprit.
A note on stimulants ‚Äì they can be helpful in moderation, but be careful.
For me, I had to actively avoid stimulants in high-energy game environments ‚Äì 5,000 fans provided plenty of natural arousal ‚Äì and artificially adding it put me over the edge. If your hands are shaking uncontrollably, there‚Äôs a sign you‚Äôre a bit too amped up to repeat your delivery with any precision.
To go along with this, relying on stimulants everyday builds a tolerance and can lead to issues and reliance over time. If you are going to use caffeine and energy drinks (which can definitely serve a purpose), save it for a couple days a week when you need it to avoid this adverse effect, and make sure not to use it to mask poor recovery habits.
You guys are going to ignore this warning until you learn the hard way, but I figured I‚Äôd put it in here nonetheless so I can say I told you so.
‚Äî
Often related to crazy travel schedules in-season, sleep is a precious commodity. I can recall multiple times my first year of pro ball where we would finish a late game, and an hour later begin a 12 hour trip through the night to our next destination only to catch a couple hour nap before needing to be at the field again the next day.
The deleterious effects of poor sleep on performance are many, and can occur even without crazy travel schedules if you begin to slack off and let bad nights of sleep stack up. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you‚Äôre a tick or two down on the radar gun after a night of tossing and turning, especially if you took sleep aids or alcohol which can reduce the amount of high quality REM sleep actually obtained during these precious hours.
‚Äî
Less common, but still worth noting, are mobility fluctuations. After the acute stress of throwing, highly stressed muscles temporarily shorten as they recover. For example, this increased tone can occur in terms of temporary lost shoulder internal rotation (as the posterior cuff recovers), forearm supination (as the pronator flexor recovers), shoulder flexion (as the lat recovers) and horizontal abduction (as the pec recovers). This is one reason, along with the cumulative fatigue from throwing, that velocity tends to decrease on day two or three of consecutive live outings.
This isn‚Äôt surprising ‚Äì for example, nobody was shocked when Brandon Morrow (pictured below) was throwing 94 instead of 100 mph by his 7th outing in 7 World Series games this past year.
Despite an apparently bulletproof UCL, even Morrow‚Äôs cyborg arm drops in velocity after insufficient recovery.
Fatigue is obviously a big factor, but understand that temporary losses in mobility play a role as well, and that these losses can become semi-permanent if left unaddressed for months or in some cases years (which is why you see some gnarly adaptations in most pitchers related to the mobility issues mentioned above). Below is one of our lefty pitchers doing an elbow supination comparison, showing just how much range can be lost over the years if left unaddressed. Not all adaptations are negative, but being aware of what‚Äôs happening in response to the workload being placed on the body can help with preventing such asymmetries from become symptomatic over time ‚Äì or beginning to bleed into performance.
A lefty pitcher showing a more than 45 degree difference in elbow supination.
‚Äî
This is an often-overlooked factor in velocity fluctuations. Going into my first outing of pro ball, I had just come off a Super Regional game where I sat 93-94 mph. On this particular day, and despite sufficient rest, I found out after my first pro outing that I was 88-92. My arm had felt great, but looking back I realized that I had gotten away from trying to attack and throw the crap out of the ball as I had the week prior. I could have freaked out, begun overanalyzing my mechanics, etc‚Ä¶, but I simply shifted the focus back to what it had been all college season ‚Äì trying to challenge and dominate hitters with my best stuff, not tentatively placing the ball into the strike zone. Lo and behold, the velocity was right back where it should have been 2 days later, and I was promoted from Rookie ball the next day.
It‚Äôs very hard to consistently produce your best fastball if you only allow yourself to focus on your best fastball when you think it matters ‚Äì scout day, off-season velocity testing, etc. Being able to lock down the focus and mentality that elicit your best days is a key aspect to having more of these types of days.
‚Äî
I hate to say it, because talking about mechanics, especially in-season, tends to be a performance nightmare. Overthinking where your body or limbs are in space, changing mechanical cues on a daily basis, or getting your ear talked off in between bullpen pitches by a well-intentioned coach are guaranteed ways to leave performance on the table.
That being said, if your landing spot, release point or hip/shoulder separation are varying wildly from pitch to pitch our outing to outing, it‚Äôs going to have an inevitable impact on your velocity.
Now, if you‚Äôre in season, that last thing you need to do to fix this is work on mechanics (if you‚Äôre in off-season velocity training, that‚Äôs potentially another story).
If you‚Äôre in-season, improve your mechanical repeatability by focusing on routines.
No, I haven‚Äôt gone off the deep end. Routines are the single reason that, despite the most god-awful mechanics (which were seemingly changing every week my first few years of college), I was still able to compete and repeat with any shred of consistency.
Routines could and probably will be an entire article to themselves, but I‚Äôm speaking specifically about three routines: your Pre-game routine, your Pre-outing/bullpen routine, and most importantly, your Pre-pitch routine.
This connects to many of the earlier points in this article, but it‚Äôs important here as well. What time do you get to the field? What do you do when you get there? How long does that take? At which moment do you turn off your phone? How long does your mobility work take? When do you begin warming up?
These are all details that big leaguers have down to a science. If you‚Äôre just taking the days as they come, you‚Äôre not doing it right, and you reduce your chances of repeating a consistent delivery.
Kershaw in his ‚ÄúBro Tank‚Äù doing shadow work before a playoff start.
If you‚Äôre a starter, when does your pre-game bullpen begin? How many pitches? In what sequence? In between innings, where in the dugout do you sit? What‚Äôs one word or breathing technique you use in between innings to stay focused?
If you‚Äôre a reliever, what inning do you head down the bullpen? What inning do you begin warming up? What inning do you begin tossing in case you‚Äôre called? What‚Äôs your bullpen sequence under ideal and ‚Äúrushed‚Äù scenarios?
These details matter, so you‚Äôre prepared for whatever comes during the game.
Repeating your mechanics becomes leaps and bounds easier when you have a pre-pitch routine. The reason for this is that your psychology has a huge impact on your physiology. Putting yourself in the same mental state before each pitch gives you the best chance to put your body into the same physiological state, and repeat your delivery from pitch to pitch.
Don‚Äôt believe me how important routines are?
Watch any college basketball or NBA player shoot a free throw.
You don‚Äôt see randomness. You see the shooter set up at the exact same spot. Pick up the target at the exact same time. Dribble the ball the same number of times, and take a deep breath, perfectly on cue. It‚Äôs a relatively simple motor pattern compared to throwing a baseball, but basketball figured out long ago the importance of routines on performance. Check out Steve Nash (below) talking about how his routine made him a great free throw shooter.
Imagine how important this principle is for repeating such a complex movement as throwing.
In college, we devoted real practice time to pre-pitch routines. There was no ball, and we weren‚Äôt even working on full dry reps ‚Äì just rehearsing the routine of getting the sign, coming set, taking a deep breath, repeating our personal keyword or mantra (‚Äúattack,‚Äù ‚Äúloose,‚Äù ‚Äúquick,‚Äù ‚Äúf#%k you,‚Äù), and delivering the pitch. We did this for 5 to 10 minutes most practices ‚Äì far more useful than running daily poles to fill time as most pitching coaches turn to.
On the road in college, we would do this Thursday nights on the opposing team‚Äôs game mound, lining up to get our mental reps in.
Still not buying it?¬† Here is a quick take from former Indians‚Äô Pitching Coach and current Mets‚Äô Manager, Mickey Callaway, on Corey Kluber‚Äôs routine between pitches.
Corey Kluber is a great example of a player with an elite pre-pitch routine.
Most of you will gloss over this final point, but it‚Äôs perhaps the most important recommendation in this entire article, so ignore it to your own detriment.
‚Äî
There are many reasons your velocity will fluctuate in-season or from bullpen to bullpen. Some fluctuation is perfectly normal. In no scenario is freaking out and jumping ship on your program the right move. This will be your gut reaction, so just recognize that‚Äôs an urge you‚Äôll have to suppress.
Take these recommendations into consideration the next time you drop 2 miles per hour and think the world is going to end ‚Äì more times than not, the answer will be staring you right in the face.
Make the logical adjustment and get refocused for the next game.
Every day is a new chance to prove yourself.

The Top 12 Reasons For Velocity Fluctuations (part 1),2018-02-28T00:57:07+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/velocity-fluctuation-pt1/,"This article is part one of a two part series on reasons an athlete‚Äôs velocity might fluctuate in-season.¬† (Note:¬† These factors contribute to off-season fluctuations as well.)
‚Äî
A growing percentage of the baseball world, which has traditionally held that velocity is ‚ÄúGod-given,‚Äù is now investing in velocity development. Strength training, weight gain shakes, long toss, radar guns and weighted balls. These are the tools being increasingly used to prepare the new crop of arms to take the mound. Still, many athletes don‚Äôt understand the complexity of what goes into setting a throwing velocity record ‚Äì and why it‚Äôs simply not feasible for a pitcher to have his A+ stuff every single time he toes the rubber.
Most pitchers can separate their outings into three categories:
A game¬†‚Äì¬†This occurs about 10% of the time. You feel like a million bucks and your stuff is electric. If only it were always like this.
B game ‚Äì¬†This occurs about 80% of the time. You feel decent. You don‚Äôt have your lights out stuff, but if you focus and compete, you‚Äôll be just fine.
C game ‚Äì¬†This occurs in about 10% of outings. You feel zombie-like, your arm moves like a slug and you need to dig deep and compete with what you‚Äôve got.
‚ÄãThe big question is why can‚Äôt we perform at our peak more regularly? And, when a sudden dip in velocity occurs, is it reason for alarm?
Let‚Äôs dive into my top reasons why your velocity is going to have its ups and downs.
‚Äî
This is one of the most common reasons for massive velocity fluctuations ‚Äì an improperly managed total throwing workload (taking into account both number and intensity of throws). Insufficient throwing workload can lead to an under-training effect, such as the pitcher who only throws on the day of his weekly start, whereas excessive throwing workloads lead to an overtraining effect and leaves the arm and body in a perpetually fatigued state.
Keep in mind, total throwing workload isn‚Äôt just live game pitches, it‚Äôs warm-ups and practice throws as well. An example is the relief pitcher who may only throw 3 one-inning outings per week (~50 pitches), but is also throwing 30-45 max effort warm-ups in the bullpen before each outing (another 90-135 pitches), in addition to his pre-game/practice throwing 6 days per week where he gets overly aggressive on many of these days as well.
The stress/adaptation response requires a stressor (throwing), followed by sufficient time to recover from that stressor and allow the body to adapt. Much like we can‚Äôt max out a muscle in the weight room every single day, we can only recover from so much throwing-specific stress.
If your arm is hanging and your velocity is fluctuating, take a close look at your total throwing workload.
‚Äî
If you aren‚Äôt continuing to strength train in-season, you should be. While you‚Äôll get away with not training for a few weeks before noticing a decline, this isn‚Äôt a good long-term strategy for maintaining your velocity late into the season. On the flip side, you‚Äôre unlikely to maintain your performance if you continue training at off-season workloads, which are geared towards building strength + size, not maintaining strength while maximizing performance.
Here‚Äôs our take on how to adjust in-season training volumes ‚Äì hint: cut your number of sets¬†in half¬†and maintain 90% of the regular weight used.
Timing of strength training is also important in-season ‚Äì schedule your 2-4 in-season lifts around your outings so that you aren‚Äôt crushing lower body the day before a planned outing, for example. This varies quite a bit based on starter vs. reliever, 5, 6 or 7-day rotation, etc. An example of how we plan this out is shown below:
‚ÄãIf you are interested in checking this out further, you can download a free copy of our in-season training blueprint here.
‚Äî
Maintaining weight + strength is a two-part equation. As we just covered above, keeping a sufficient training stimulus is part one. Part two is keeping a sufficient caloric intake. Without sufficient calories, your body won‚Äôt have the raw building material to hold on to the muscle mass gained in the off-season.
Couple a sharp rise in energy expenditure in-season, with a 4 to 6 hour daily window when athletes are at the field and typically not eating at all, and this is a recipe for muscle, strength and velocity loss.
Consuming around 1,000 calories during this time (a pre-batting practice peanut butter sandwich, a pre-game granola bar and a mid-game protein bar, for example) is the best way to offset this. Just be sure you‚Äôre still hitting sufficient calories + meals the rest of the day, and regularly collecting bodyweight measurements to monitor any sharp weekly drops.
The other factor to consider is that after a day or two of being in a calorie deficit, even if noticeable weight hasn‚Äôt been lost, energy levels and mood begin to worsen (as muscle glycogen stores are depleted), which in my experience can certainly have an impact on in-game performance. Don‚Äôt skip meals, especially the days leading up to a game!
‚Äî
To add on to the above, not only will insufficient calories lead to weight/strength loss, lethargy and possible velocity dips, but the breakdown of these calories can play a role as well.
Protein intake is crucial, as it plays a key role in muscle recovery and strength maintenance ‚Äì too little protein in the diet, and the body will begin to dip into its own protein stores (muscle mass!). Shoot for 1 gram of protein per day, per pound of bodyweight. For me, I shoot for anywhere between 200 and 230 grams per day.
In-season, and with travel, getting sufficient protein from fast food type restaurants can be a struggle. Supplementing with a few scoops of Whey protein per day, or remembering to ask for double meat on your Subway sub or Chipotle bowl are useful tweaks when traveling.
Carbohydrates are your body‚Äôs preferred energy source during moderate to intense exercise, and they come in two forms: simple and complex. Simple carbs are your quick-acting sugars ‚Äì keep these as low as possible in all but the pre-game/pre-workout window. Complex carbs, or starches, which provide a sustained release of energy, should make up the bulk of your carbs. Potatoes, rice, bread ‚Äì eating enough carbs usually isn‚Äôt an issue, but if you reduce your intake¬†too low, it can lead to low energy, decreased endurance and decreased performance.
Completely avoiding fats isn‚Äôt a good idea either, as fat intake plays a role in maintaining testosterone levels and general hormonal balance. Most athletes have no trouble getting saturated fats ‚Äì from greasy burgers or dairy, but struggle to remember to get unsaturated ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù fats from nut butters, avocadoes, and coconut/olive oil.
Snacking on trail mix/nuts on the road, or adding healthy oils to your meals at home are two easy way to cover your bases.
‚Äî
The first thing most pitchers do after an uncharacteristically low velocity day is to freak out. Oftentimes, the elements play a role. Extreme cold or hot, wind, and especially rain, will have an effect on day-to-day velocity fluctuations.
‚Äî
Many pitchers notoriously throw harder outdoors than indoors. This tends to be due to improved traction with cleats on a quality clay mound vs. a turf indoor mound. Anything that improves traction will tend to improve the ability to transfer force through the ground off the back leg, and effectively stick the landing to transfer force through the front leg up the kinetic chain.
While throwing outside tends to elicit higher velocities, loose dirt mounds, or worse, muddy conditions, are a pitcher‚Äôs worst nightmares from a velocity standpoint.
The height of the mound plays a role as well ‚Äì don‚Äôt expect to see perfectly uniform, manicured clay mounds until you reach the upper college or professional levels.¬†Taller mounds tend to elicit higher velocities than shorter mounds, but the magnitude of this effect does seem to be dependent on the individual.¬†Pitchers with more north-south mechanics (see Sandy Koufax below) seem to benefit more from a large slope than lower arm slot, east-west pitchers (i.e. Randy Johnson). This is purely anecdotal, but it makes sense in terms of matching the plane of rotation to the slope of the mound.

"The Case for Lifting Weights, A Declaration for The Youth Pitcher",2018-02-08T18:58:07+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/case-for-lifting-weights/,"Today‚Äôs guest post comes from Warren McAlpine, an up and coming trainer, amateur powerlifter and former baseball player who is currently pursuing his degree in Physical Therapy.
‚Äî
As a kid who grew up in the 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs access to baseball training information was limited. The process of getting information was to ask the local legend how he got his 90 mph fastball and played in the big leagues. This was usually met with a variety of replies, from ‚ÄúI had a God-given arm‚Äù to ‚Äúone spring I returned from a growth spurt¬†and was throwing much harder‚Äù‚Ä¶ or, ‚ÄúI just long tossed one summer and gained 10 mph.‚Äù¬†¬†As a child, ignorant of most physics concepts, the questions usually stopped there. Most people do not drill down to the next level ‚Äì like what makes a God-given arm? It is true, certain athletes shoulder girdles and layback are predisposed to throwing objects;¬†hence, the ‚ÄòGod- given arm.‚Äô But,¬†what if you were not born with a God-given arm? How do you increase your velocity? The most logical step is to become ‚Äúmore forceful‚Äù through any means possible.
Now for the science!
‚Äî
Newton‚Äôs second law states that when a constant force (your physique)¬†acts on a¬†body (baseball), it causes it to accelerate, i.e., to change its velocity, at a constant rate. In the simplest case, a force applied to an object at rest causes it to accelerate in the direction that the force is applied.
Where;¬†Force = Mass * Acceleration(Velocity^2)
Force is therefore¬†a product of velocity and the direction.
What we can deduce from this equation is that there is a linear relationship between mass and force and an exponential relationship between velocity and force. The exponential component is in part why guys like Chris Sale can have high velocity outputs, despite a lower body mass. They have the arm and shoulder structures necessary to accelerate a 5-ounce object near 100 mph at less than 180 lbs. But for vast majority of the 95mph + guys, they rely more on mass. How much mass? Try around 175-180+ lbs. of lean body mass.¬† And the shorter you are, the more important lean body mass is to throwing gas (you have less room to get creative with your leverages). For most, there isn‚Äôt any way around gaining lean tissue to throw harder.
‚Äî
1990: ~191 lbs.2017: ~213 lbs.
Subsequently, the average 4 seam fastball has risen from¬†89.2 mph in 1990 to 93.3¬†mph in 2017. Ask any pitcher how hard it is to raise your average velocity 4.1¬†mph at that level of specificity?¬†In 1990, a left-handed pitcher¬†throwing 90 mph¬†would get you¬†drafted in the top 3 rounds of the MLB draft. Now, it only gets you college attention and possibly a late round draft pick.
Source: Mlb.com¬†¬†Source: fangraphs.com
One hitting¬†note, if you were paying attention to baseball in 1998 during the Sosa vs. McGwire Home Run Chase, their increased bat speed that was sending balls 550 ft. into the stands had little to do with any changes to swinging mechanics and had almost everything to do with the fact that they were each carrying about 25-30¬†lbs. more muscle mass than they did when each¬†were rookies.¬† If you recall what is now baseball history, these two were later indicted on anabolic steroid chargers that darkened the game for about a decade. But many still missed the lesson this¬†drug-use provided.
Despite all the¬†evidence that increasing muscle mass increases your ability to apply force to an object, you will still run into many pitching coaches,¬†throwing gurus and hitting instructors¬†who still¬†claim that you don‚Äôt have to gain muscle mass to throw or swing a bat harder. They often will comment, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about mechanics,‚Äù or ‚Äúweightlifting will make you inflexible‚Äù while failing to articulate exactly what mechanical competencies you are gaining while under their instruction.
It is true,¬†lifting weights is not a prerequisite for every pitcher to throw 90, 95 or even 100 mph. Some of the athletes at the highest level¬†are so physically endowed with an athletic predisposition to throw gas that it seems unfair. They can thank their parents. They are the 1% of the 1%. But, for you the reader, it is much more likely that your primary¬†avenue to throwing harder, starting for your high school varsity team,¬†receiving a college scholarship, or getting drafted is to get stronger and gain muscle mass.
For the novice, you will immediately run faster, throw harder, jump higher and even become more coordinated¬†after you have started a weight training regime. This effect dampens as you become more intermediate and advanced in your training history. Said another way, your velocity return will not be linear, but the trend will still be positive over time. This does not even include the psychological¬†benefits you gain from appearing bigger on the mound or filling out your uniform at the plate.
[Editor‚Äôs note: Ben documented his lean body mass progression through high school and college ‚Äì note this point of diminishing returns as he became more advanced.
‚Äî
Graph 1: Normal distribution for high school fastball velocity
Your¬†propensity to throw hard is likely at the mean. In other words, your genetic endowment to throw hard is likely square in the middle. I know this by just implementing a¬†basic understanding of statistics. This near average velocity¬†is likely in large part because the amount of lean body mass you are carrying is also likely near the middle. So, for most of the high school students¬†reading this article, your mound velocity is most likely between 76-84¬†mph. The further along you are on this scale, the better, especially if you haven‚Äôt spent any time lifting weights.
Graph 2: Distribution of high school lean body mass
Fortunately,¬†this is the area that you can influence the most despite your genetics. Taller guys will have an advantage (about 8-10 lbs. of lean mass per inch of height), but everyone can improve their lean body mass by adhering to a¬†consistent calorie surplus diet and strong work ethic in the weight room that includes some form of progressive overload.¬† Remember, lean body mass (LBM) is your mass minus how much fat you are carrying.
Lean Body Mass (LBM):¬†Total Mass (what you weigh on the scale)¬†‚Äì¬†Fat weight
Example:¬†¬†A 200-pound athlete at 20% bodyfat has a LBM of 160 lbs. Or 200 lbs. ‚Äì 40 lbs. of fat.
For athletes out of puberty, just eating will not likely add muscle. You need to train and train hard.
‚Äî
A post pubescent novice athlete, who has never trained, can gain up to about¬†20 lbs. of lean tissue within one year of dedication on a properly structured nutrition and training program.¬† Let that sink in: one year of weight training and dieting in a scaled calorie surplus and you will be able to move 1.5¬†standard deviations from your starting point¬†in lean body mass. So, if you are a 16-year-old starting at around 130 lbs., you can expect to move to 150¬†lbs. in 12-18 months¬†of work.¬† Match this with an above average throwing program and you are likely to see 1.5 deviations of improvement¬†in your pitch velocity. With this understanding in mind, it would behoove you to set aside a significant part of your sports calendar lifting weights. For parents, the next time you are considering spending $5,000¬†for your son to play travel baseball, a better investment is to spend that on either weightlifting equipment, strength coaching or better nutrition for your child.¬†Contrary to what many coaches will tell you, the entrance exam for college coaches and pro scouts is not does the athlete throw strikes? ‚Äîit is¬†simply‚Äî how hard does he throw?¬†Or, for the professionals‚Äîhow hard will he throw at 21-24 years old? Many learn this harsh reality too late, or were unequipped with the right information to improve the velocity gaining process. I‚Äôm not saying to ignore strike-throwing, just to align the training priorities where the college coaches and pro scouts do.
What the 13-18-year-old lean mass gain should theoretically look like for a high school pitcher:
***Orange line indicates what an athlete can expect to gain in mass by just growing and matriculating in the process of becoming a young adult. Citing an earlier claim, 136 lbs. is the average LBM for high school baseball players.¬†If you have made it this far through the article, I can assume you aren‚Äôt interested in being average or throwing¬†80 mph at 18 years old.
Notice that the mass gain is nonlinear over the duration of a year and nonlinear over the 5-year span. Most simply said, your muscle mass gain will not be in a straight line.¬†Peaks should be met before the season begins, with slight decreases (after the inflection point)¬†in LBM as the season goes on. A good strength coach will have you on ‚Äúmaintenance program‚Äù that will hopefully keep that hard-earned mass on you as the season endures. The sooner you start tacking on good mass to your frame, the more likely your body is going to figure out how to put that force (F=ma)¬†behind the baseball.¬†One more note, under this model, the gaining durations¬†are shorter for your seasons and grow as you age. For an athlete whose clock is ticking (i.e., 17+ years old) it may be worth considering an abbreviated season¬†and focusing more on mass/strength gain (see: Should I Play Summer Ball).
‚Äî
If you look at the graph, I took 120 lbs. as the average lean body mass for a 13-year-old. Some will be above this due to height, some will be below. Even if you are at the average you can still land at around 165-170 lbs. of LBM by the time college and pro scouts are interested (17-18 years old). If you are a 13 or 14-year-old reading this, the journey is full of hard work and some uncomfortable eating and lifting at times. However, if you begin at the right time, the average athlete can be carrying about the same lean body mass as your local major division 1 college player. Don‚Äôt ever let someone beat you on the things you can control.
[Editor‚Äôs note: TreadAthletics is working on a comprehensive youth training guide, estimated for a December 2018 release. The goal of youth training, as Warren alludes to, isn‚Äôt to treat young athletes as elite ones, but to begin introducing them to fundamental motor patterns, neurological adaptations, and prepare them to take advantage of the potential muscle growth that comes with the onset of testosterone and puberty]
You need to lift weights if you want to throw harder.
‚Äî
Scouts, both college and pro,¬†have long sought out taller pitchers in pre-draft and draft scenarios looking for pitchers who will develop because they are ‚ÄúProjectable.‚Äù What these scouts have noticed is that taller pitchers typically develop later in their careers. The devil is in the details here, what this¬†trend is mostly hiding is that these players are just¬†able to gain more mass, it just takes longer for that process to mature.
‚Äî
All else¬†equal, bigger guys¬†throw harder! And guys with ‚Äúwhip arms‚Äù ‚Äì great external rotation and layback¬†also throw hard.¬†Can either of these qualities be trained? The answer is yes, but by far away the easiest and quickest return¬†is going to be gaining lean mass through strength training. Gaining external rotation from throwing, soft tissue work and mobility exercises are important as well.¬† Adjusting someone‚Äôs anthropometry (limb structure and measurement) is¬†out of the picture without some very creative surgery.
There is a scene in the movie Moneyball, where Peter Brand is discussing the ‚Äúepic failure to understand where runs come from‚Äù to General Manager, Billy Beane. This conversation was the cornerstone to the birth of Sabermetrics (a statistical understanding of baseball). Now, almost every team in Major League Baseball has some sort of Sabermetrics team working on decodifying run production and other player metrics. Understanding where velocity comes from is the next wave in the evolution of the game and will shape its future. Guys are throwing harder than ever and the entrance exams for the collegiate pitching and the professional pitcher are only getting steeper.

Bulking on a Budget,2017-12-23T17:34:53+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/budget-bulking/,"One of the biggest misconceptions about weight gain is that it has to drain your wallet. It‚Äôs more food, right? In what world would this not cost more? Several athletes, over the years, have complained they‚Äôre spending $25 or even $30 a day on food ‚Äì twice as much as before they began working with us and we gave them much more robust calorie and macronutrient recommendations. In light of this myth that won‚Äôt seem to die, I thought I‚Äôd put together a list of rules and guidelines for bulking on a budget. For me, bulking has always been very comparable to maintenance or fat loss in terms of cost, so let‚Äôs dive into why your cost complaints are just an excuse!
‚Äî
The goal of a weight gain diet is to keep you in a caloric surplus and maximize the proportion of muscle to fat gained. While this ratio is dependent on more than just diet, the level of calorie surplus and the macronutrient breakdown are two of the most important nutritional components to be aware of.
Rather than just trying to double the number of meals eaten or follow a vague ‚Äúsee food‚Äù diet, take a calculated approach. This will allow you to better choose foods that fit your protocol and make informed adjustments as you go. It‚Äôs amazing how easy it becomes to manipulate your weight when you become aware of the calorie and macronutrient content of the food you‚Äôre putting into your body.
‚Äî
Adding on to the last point, the goal is adding muscle mass, not mass. While a proportion of fat mass is inevitable (and among advanced athletes, will actually make up a large percentage of weight gained during mini bulks), there is a tendency to get overzealous and think that if 4,000 calories is good, 6,000 calories will be better.
Two problems with this philosophy ‚Äì first, it becomes unsustainable and actually reduces the chances the athlete will actually follow through on the plan by force-feeding and jumping into massive intakes all at once. (Not great for sustained progress!) Second, your body has a maximal rate of protein synthesis under normal training conditions, so even a novice isn‚Äôt going to build 10 pounds of muscle in a month. Shooting for extreme intakes will help an athlete build muscle by ensuring a consistent calorie surplus, but it just leads to an unnecessarily large amount of fat at the tail end that must then be shed (and this ratio of muscle-to-fat gain actually worsens the fatter you get, which is why I recommend getting relatively lean before bulking).
Getting in the right degree of calorie surplus will save money unnecessarily spent on excessive intakes. Typically, this means shooting for an intake that leads to about 1 lb of weight gain per week.
‚Äî
This is the most important recommendation for bulking on a budget and what our athletes in the intro were doing ‚Äì even if you choose relatively cheap restaurants like Chipotle, this adds up to a massive grocery bill each month. Learning the basics of cooking is essential to be able to implement this step ‚Äì you don‚Äôt need to be Martha Stewart to know how to whip up some rice, pasta, meat or frozen veggies, but there are a shocking number of guys in high school and even college who have never cooked a damn thing in their life, because the first thing that cooked looked like this:
If this is your idea of grilled cheese, we‚Äôve got some work to do.
‚Äî
I‚Äôm not saying to never go out to eat, but to establish a budget if money is tight, and when you do go out, try to pick options that maximize the number of quality calories per dollar. Also, consider meal prepping if time is an issue, as it will save you a ton over the course of the month. For value, you can‚Äôt beat Chipotle (or its inferior cousins, Q‚Äôdoba and Moe‚Äôs). Here‚Äôs how to get the most out of it for fat loss or bulking:
‚Äî
Protein is notoriously the most expensive macronutrient per calorie and is going to make up the bulk of your grocery bill year round. It‚Äôs a crucial macronutrient for building muscle, but consuming 400 grams of protein a day is doing nothing for you besides doubling your grocery bill and giving you egg farts.
Stick to around 1 gram of protein per day per lb of bodyweight (200g for a 200 lb male). Definitely don‚Äôt fall too short of this range, but there isn‚Äôt much use in going above either when it comes to bulking.
Here‚Äôs the other kicker ‚Äì you‚Äôll be consuming much more protein as a byproduct of the increased quantities of pasta, nuts, legumes, etc. which drops the meat/dairy requirements even further, often saving money when bulking compared to cutting.
I‚Äôd recommend staying under $4/lb for meat (and shooting for under $2.50/lb for chicken).
‚Äî
Carbs are where you‚Äôll be consuming the bulk of your calories from ‚Äì which is good news because they‚Äôre dirt-cheap. Rice, pasta and potatoes have stood the test of time ‚Äì and doubling your carb intake represents only a fractional increase in your grocery bill.
‚Äî
The great thing about fats, for bulking, is that they‚Äôre the most calorie dense micronutrient by far. Compared to 4 calories per gram of carb or protein, fat contains 9 delicious calories per gram. Those 3 spoonfuls of peanut butter that makes a dangerous snack on a fat loss diet, just became a 600 calorie weight gain bomb that‚Äôll cost you under $1.00. It‚Äôs also inexpensive to buy healthy oils, like avocado or olive oil in bulk, and cook your potatoes, meat, etc. in them. You can even add light tasting olive oil to your smoothies (2 tbsp only costs about 30-40 cents, but packs 240 calories).
‚Äî
While veggies are awesome for fat loss because, in general, they are highly filling, this is the opposite of what we want when trying to cram 4,000+ calories down our throats. This doesn‚Äôt mean to totally ignore the value of veggies, but it does mean to not over consume them when bulking and to pick less filling options when you do. My favorite option? A couple handfuls of spinach, cooked in olive, or avocado oil, which cooks down to 1-2 bites worth and takes up a fraction of the space in your stomach compared to many other veggies. Spinach also goes great in smoothies or omelets for you rebels out there who refuse to eat it like this:
‚Äî
This is an obvious one, but you can find the best deals at Sam‚Äôs Club or Costco. Stock up and save ‚Äì and make sure to hit each of the free samples a few times over.
‚Äî
It‚Äôs quite simple to substitute out your regular food items for the higher fat (and higher calorie) options for periods of weight gain. Switch out 2% milk for whole milk. Drop from 96% lean ground beef to 85-90%. Take those 50 calorie fat-loss friendly tortillas and get the 200+ calorie ones instead.
These simple substitutions have the double benefit of saving your wallet and making it so you minimize the amount of force-feeding, if any, you‚Äôll be doing.
You can create 1,000+ calorie jumps in your daily intake without adding additional meals or changing the quantity of food that you‚Äôre eating.
Read that again‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs the reason our athletes are able to sustain higher intakes ‚Äì it typically barely feels like they‚Äôre ‚Äúbulking,‚Äù except for the fact that the scale is going up every week!
‚Äî
The point of this example is not to show you have to eat 5,000 calories to gain weight (which often is excessive), it‚Äôs to show that even with an extreme intake, eating for <$10 is still quite possible.
Target Macros: Fat ‚Äì 180g, Carbs ‚Äì 625g, Protein ‚Äì 220g, Calories ‚Äì 5,000
Here‚Äôs a sample day of eating that gets pretty damn close to these macros with calories and price included.
Breakfast (1,530 calories): Cheese Omelette and peanut butter toast
> 4 egg omelette with 2/3 cup shredded cheese and 2 cups spinach
> 3 slices of multigrain toast covered in 4 tbsp natural peanut butter
> 2 cups whole milk
Lunch (1,750 calories): Chicken and rice burritos
> 1 cup rice (dry measure) with 2 tbsp coconut oil mixed in
> 8 oz. grilled chicken breast, chopped
> 3 large flour tortillas
Dinner (1,330 calories): Pasta with meat sauce
> 8 oz. whole grain pasta
> 15 oz. tomato sauce
> 6oz ground beef, 85% lean
Anytime Snack (380 calories): 2 granola bars
Final macros: Fat ‚Äì 178g, Carbs ‚Äì 613g, Protein ‚Äì 228g, Calories ‚Äì 4,990
$0.67 for 4 eggs
$0.70 for 4 tbsp natural peanut butter
$0.30 for 3 slice of multigrain bread
$0.28 for 2/3 cup of shredded cheese
$0.25 for 2 cups whole milk
$0.22 for 2 cups spinach (raw measure) 
¬†
$0.56 for 1 cup of rice
$0.42 for 2 tbsp coconut oil
$1.00 for 8oz chicken breast
$0.84 for 3 tortillas
¬†
$0.69 for 8oz pasta
$0.50 for half can of tomato sauce
$1.45 for 6 oz. ground beef
$0.84 for 2 granola bar servings
The best part about this is that there‚Äôs still wiggle some room left over for basic supplementation, additional veggies, etc., or eating out for 8 bucks 5 times per month, all while still staying around the $10/day mark.
> Rice ‚Äì a 20 lb bag is about 45 cups of rice (dry measure) and ranges from $17-$30. We picked $25 for this estimate.
> Coconut oil ‚Äì I found 54 oz. (107 tbsp) for about 22 bucks here.
> Eggs ‚Äì $2/dozen is realistic price if you buy in bulk.
> Peanut Butter ‚Äì bought in bulk, you can get 75 2 tbsp servings for about 25 bucks.
> Multigrain Bread ‚Äì Under $1.50 per 15‚Äìslice Pick higher calorie bread (>100 calories per slice).
> Shredded Cheese ‚Äì under 5 bucks for a 2-pound bag of shredded cheese.
> Whole milk ‚Äì $2/gallon isn‚Äôt too hard to find.
> Whole Grain Pasta ‚Äì $1.38 per pound is cheap. Regular pasta can dip well below $1 to save even more.
> Tomato Sauce ‚Äì 29 ounces for under $1. Can‚Äôt beat that.
> Large Flour Tortillas ‚Äì 16 large tortillas for $4.38
> Ground Beef ‚Äì under $4/lb isn‚Äôt too hard to find.
> Chicken Breast ‚Äì $2/lb in bulk makes this one of the cheapest protein options.
> Granola Bar ‚Äì $5 per 12 pack (2 pars per pack).
> Spinach ‚Äì under $2 for a 10oz bag, which gives you about 7 2-cup servings.
‚Äî
Gaining weight, even for the hardest of hard-gainers, doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank or require the type of force feeding often associated with successful bulks. Follow the guidelines laid out in this article, apply a smidgen of consistency, and train like a savage in the weight room on a smart program that addresses your individual limitations.
Now it‚Äôs time to get back to work.

Why Dominicans Are Dominating Baseball,2017-04-06T23:05:58+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/dominican-domination/,"This article is based on my experiences and observations playing in college and professional baseball along with dozens of Dominican and Latin players. This is in no way a criticism, but rather my comparison, of both Dominican and American baseball culture and development. The discussion started with a simple tweet. Allow me to expand further on this tweet, and the implications for player development.
‚Äî
Even on the surface, the differences between the US and the Dominican Republic are stark. The Dominican is home to roughly 10.5 million people, compared to the 319 million in the United States.
In 2015, 83 out of 750 players on opening day were Dominican (compared to 520 US-born), accounting for roughly 11 percent of the major leagues.¬†To put this in perspective, there is one Dominican big leaguer for every 63,000 people, compared to one American big leaguer for every 307,000. This means that the Dominican Republic produces major league talent at about 5 times the rate of the US.
In the minor leagues, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see even higher numbers. By my count, 44% of players in the first two levels of the White Sox minor league organization are Dominican-born, and that number climbs to well over 60% at these early levels if you take into account other foreign born players as well (Venezuela, Mexico, Puerto Rico, etc‚Ä¶).
However you slice it, these numbers are staggering, especially when you consider the sheer amount¬†of resources and coaching available to the majority of American-born athletes.
Many American parents drop thousands of dollars per year on lessons, travel ball teams and equipment in the hopes of advancing their sons‚Äô careers, while Dominican players largely get by without fancy equipment or coaching.
‚Äî
If we further analyze the discrepancy based on big league players produced per dollar spent, the numbers are mind-numbing. The average annual¬†adult salary in the DR is just under $5,000, compared to just under $40,000 in the US. Living at or below the poverty line leaves far less, if any, disposable income for equipment, lessons, etc.
Compare this to a dirt-cheap American high school travel team fee ($1,200/year), one $50 lesson per month ($600/year), just one glove or bat per year (~$199) and without even taking into account travel expenses, you‚Äôre looking at over $2000 per year per American kid that has even a passing interest at playing high school or college baseball.*
So how does the DR produce MLB talent at 5 times the rate of the US (and pro talent at closer to 10 times the rate), all while spending easily 10 times (and probably more like 20 or 30x) less per year on the athletes‚Äô development?
Either much of the US is doing something very wrong from a developmental perspective, or the Dominican is doing something very right. As you may have guessed by now, it‚Äôs actually a bit of both.
Here are my top 4 reasons why I believe the Dominican Republic (and other Latin countries) pump out prospects far better than the US:
*I didn‚Äôt have access to quite those types of resources growing up, so I‚Äôm not saying you have to spend that much money to develop, but this is overwhelmingly ‚Äúthe norm‚Äù for many American kids nowadays.
‚Äî
This is just basic human psychology. If your family is struggling at or below the poverty line and you are offered a way to take care of your family for life, wouldn‚Äôt you work harder than if you grew up with a relatively comfortable life? Maybe your American parents had financial struggles, but you never had to worry if food would be on the table. Maybe your parents got sick, but you probably didn‚Äôt have to worry if they would get proper medical care or risk dying from curable illnesses. Of course, these are generalizations. I grew up far from privileged so I understand that this doesn‚Äôt describe every American or Dominican.
A strange thing happens when you flip the switch from want to need. When you want to succeed, you may align your intentions with the long-term goal, but your actions are easily derailed. I want to gain 20 pounds quickly becomes ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather go out with my friends, sleep in and skip breakfast.‚Äù
When you need something, you‚Äôll stop at nothing to make that goal a reality. There is no other choice. You can‚Äôt slow down, even for a second. In this way, desperation is one of the most powerful motivators.
This is why entrepreneurs talk about the need to live off ramen noodles and struggle for a time, just to understand that feeling. This is why coaches always talk about getting ‚Äúcomfortable being uncomfortable.‚Äù Being comfortable is a surefire path towards mediocrity.
I‚Äôm not saying every Dominican has an exceptional work ethic, or that every American is content and lazy. But just recognize the average living situations for what they are and the impact it might have on normal human psychology.
But hey, maybe you‚Äôre a super motivated American kid. What else sets the Dominican system apart?
‚Äî
Want to get off the island? Throw with everything you‚Äôve got like your idol: Pedro. Swing out of your shoes to hit dingers like Cano. Everyone is competitive ‚Äì that‚Äôs human nature ‚Äì but the Dominican baseball culture¬†is tool-centric too. You can‚Äôt throw 92 or hit a ball 400 feet by age 18? You‚Äôre probably not getting signed.
Pedro the Goat
‚Äî
This is why in American pro ball there is almost an expectation of young Dominicans being ‚Äúunpolished‚Äù when they arrive in rookie ball. You see hard-throwing, free-swinging athletes who are a product of this culture. While this is seen by many as a critique, let‚Äôs not forget that it got them there, and that it‚Äôs rare to see a Dominican in pro ball who didn‚Äôt sign for at least $50-100,000, which is potentially life-changing money. They‚Äôve already won, in many ways, just by being there.**
Are these generalizations? Sure. But, bear with me just a while longer all you offended 82 mph strike-throwers.
**While many do, not every Dominican is lucky enough to sign for money. I can recall one instance where a good friend / Dominican teammate didn‚Äôt have money to fly home when his mother died during the season. We passed a hat around the locker room until there was enough to send him home for a few days to be with the rest of his family. Still other players would send meal money home to family rather than spend it on themselves, prompting some organizations to just issue meal vouchers to their players instead.
‚Äî
An interesting phenomenon that exists in the baseball world is the existence of talent ‚Äúhotbeds.‚Äù In the US, we‚Äôre talking about areas like Georgia, Florida, Texas and Southern California that crank out a disproportionately high crop of premium talent year after year, just like the Dominican. While factors like population density and year-round warm weather no-doubt contribute to these numbers on some level, let‚Äôs examine it from two additional angles: competition and motor learning.
‚Äî
Both on a micro (team) and macro (league) scale, competition breeds a higher caliber of athlete. As the caliber of players reaches a certain threshold, this creates a positive feedback loop ‚Äì better players push everyone else to train and compete harder just to keep up (i.e. just to make a Varsity team in high school), which creates even more high caliber players. Furthermore, players who might otherwise be dominating lesser geographical areas can‚Äôt take their foot off the gas pedal, or they know that success will be short-lived. An 84 mph high school pitcher may go undefeated in Iowa and, satisfied, stop pushing. That same pitcher in Southern California might struggle just to make his high school‚Äôs JV team, forcing him to keep pressing and improving himself.
Side note: as a high school player who didn‚Äôt come from this type of hotbed, and where 85 mph meant you were the league ace, it became very important for me to use objective metrics to judge myself against. If I knew the numbers that players at the next level were achieving, I could train for and compare myself against those. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt make it if I just compared myself to my current level of competition.
‚Äî
One of the primary ways in which motor learning occurs is through imitation (1). In other words, we can trace back higher level throwing, hitting and other baseball-specific movement patterns to an athlete‚Äôs individual expression of the patterns he was exposed to over the course of his development (and in particular, during the very early stages of development, as once the general patterns are learned, these patterns are then further reinforced, and to some extent refined, through repetition).
Put simply, athletes who are surrounded by higher level athletes (and patterns) tend to have a better opportunity and chance of developing higher level patterns themselves. Athletes who are surrounded by non-competitive, low level patterns from a young age are at a massive disadvantage if their goal is to acquire high-level patterns.
Imagine child A growing up in small town America, learning to play catch with the dad below, and only seeing the patterns expressed by other athletes in his intramural little league.
Child B grows up in a minor league locker room, learns to hit and throw with elite players and observes and watches these patterns for a decade. It‚Äôs no mystery who will end up with the better patterns 999 times out of 1,000.
This point applies to any baseball hotbed, including the Dominican, but also American hotbeds like those mentioned above. ‚ÄúExcellence breeds excellence‚Äù is therefore not only a true statement ‚Äì it‚Äôs science.
‚Äî
To pretend that these and only these factors account for the differences in US and Dominican baseball achievement would be false. I‚Äôll touch briefly on a couple of these.
‚Äî
While both cultures do have PED-related issues, a larger differentiator is age fabrication, which is extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate for the MLB. However, this practice is well known by pro organizations and most simply don‚Äôt care if the prospect is actually 16 or 19 years old if the on-field product is adequate.
I know Latin players¬†who openly share their real names and ages with teammates, but are or were forced to portray a false identity (often by their agents) in order to attempt to be a more desirable prospect to their respective organizations or earn a larger bonus at signing.
‚Äî
Longer limbs/ shorter torsos (or ‚Äúhigh butt‚Äù as Buck Showalter calls it) may lend itself to better leverages and energy transfer for throwing or hitting. Not only do longer relative legs and arms directly improve leverages, but because the primary function of the torso in hitting/throwing is to stiffen to effectively transfer kinetic energy between the lower and upper half, it‚Äôs possible that shorter torsos may also aid velocity via minimizing¬†lost energy during this transfer.
In other words, two 6‚Äô4‚Äù pitchers are not two 6‚Äô4‚Äù pitchers. Pitcher A may have a 6‚Äô2‚Äù wingspan, a long torso, and short legs relative to his height, while Pitcher B may have a 6‚Äô6‚Äù wingspan, a short torso and long legs relative to his height (potentially more advantageous for throwing/hitting).¬†Scouts have known this for decades, often describing the ideal pitcher‚Äôs body as ‚Äúall arms and legs.‚Äù Below is one example of a 6‚Äô2‚Ä≥ pitcher with a 6‚Äô8‚Ä≥ inch wingspan, followed by a 6‚Äô6‚Ä≥ pitcher with a 6‚Äô2‚Ä≥ wingspan. Height is therefore just a crude approximation for levers and proportions.
Is this even relevant? Hard to say without data. While there is data showing anthropometric differences, on average, between African, Mexican and Caucasian Americans*, I uncovered no such data¬†for Dominicans, making this possibility purely speculative.
Jeurys Familia (Dominican Republic) and his long levers.
‚Äî
*In this particular study on ethnicity and skeletal structure, the authors concluded ‚Äúblacks have longer legs and shorter trunks than whites, Asians have longer trunks and shorter legs than whites, [Mexican americans] have similar body proportions as whites, but they are shorter.‚Äù (2)
‚Äî
Let‚Äôs summarize what we‚Äôve discussed, and how you can apply it to either your own or your athletes‚Äô development in order to improve your results.
> Learn the difference between want vs. need (easier said than done ‚Äì if you grew up comfortable and without a fire under your ass, the first step is to figure out your why).
> You don‚Äôt need fancy tools (if resources are limited, pour the majority of them into development, not gear, gimmicks and showcases).
> Your pitching/hitting coach is probably unnecessary (again, unless tool development is their priority, stop working on balance points, high cocked positions and towel drills. Train to move athletically and throw the crap out of the ball).
> Focus on tool development over stats/winning games (understanding what scouts and college coaches actually do and don‚Äôt look for helps direct training efforts towards those goals)
> Surround yourself with high caliber athletes (if you live in a non-baseball state, consider playing higher level summer ball out of state, visiting elite training facilities, and making sure you‚Äôre the softest throwing/weakest person in the room as often as possible).
> Fabricate your age, learn Spanish and get a spray tan (okay, I‚Äôm just kidding about this one).
> Understand your body / levers (again, you can‚Äôt do much to change this, but understanding genetic advantages/disadvantages is good information to have in building your training plan)
As baseball continues to grow internationally, it raises the collective competitiveness of baseball greatly. Latin American players bring a toolsy swagger to the higher levels of the game that didn‚Äôt just appear out of thin air ‚Äì it‚Äôs largely learned behavior, and a good number of American players could learn a thing or two from it.

Should I Play Summer Ball? Weighing the Pros and Cons,2017-01-19T17:00:08+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/summer-ball/,"One question I get repeatedly takes some form of the following:
My coach wants me to play summer ball, but my velocity and stuff isn‚Äôt anywhere near where it needs to be for me to play at the next level. Should I pitch or take the summer off to train? Or, should I try to train hard while also pitching?
‚Äî
At the heart of this problem is the conflict of interest between college coaches and many of their players ‚Äì coaches need to win games to keep their jobs (and advance their careers), while players, at least at the higher levels of college baseball, often have the primary goal of playing professional baseball in some capacity.
For coaches, this means getting their players polished and ready to compete to the best of their ability with their current stuff. Throw more strikes, stay composed in pressure game situations and refine off-speed pitches. Occasionally, mechanical tweaks or pitch grips alone will lead to minor improvements in stuff (great!) but most of the time, pitching coaches scoff at players who express the primary desire to improve their raw stuff over other refinements because it‚Äôs not as direct of a path to wins.
For players, if playing professionally is the goal, most know that their raw stuff needs to improve, and that constant competition makes it harder to pursue velocity building programs and aggressive strength training or weight gain regimens. Don‚Äôt believe me? Try going to 5 games a week over the summer. This entails 3 to 6-hour bus rides each way (depending on the league), 5 to 6 hours at the field, while still trying to get good lifts in and hitting your nutrition numbers. Good luck! That being said, there still are times when playing summer ball makes sense, even if stuff development is a priority.
‚Äî
You‚Äôre a freshman in college and your stuff isn‚Äôt quite up to par yet. Maybe you redshirted or only got a few innings here and there. While you‚Äôre tempted to take the summer off to keep working on your strength and velocity gains, there is value in getting some innings under your belt one or two summers during college if you didn‚Äôt pop the college cherry during your spring season. For me, learning composure on the mound, gaining confidence that I could get hitters out at the college level, and getting live reps on my pitches was an important step, even if I was still far from where I needed to be stuff-wise. This isn‚Äôt to say that you must play summer ball, but taking 2-3 months when you weren‚Äôt able to get live reps in the spring helps from getting too far away from the game. Not to mention, summer ball is¬†fun. The bus trips may be hell on your recovery, your host family might have an obnoxious set of house rules, and you may wish your training schedule was more regular ‚Äì but those couple summers are¬†some of the best memories I have.
Recommendation: could go either way.
Summer ball will develop other tools as well‚Ä¶like two-ball ability.
‚Äî
If you threw 40+ innings in the spring, but your stuff is still 3-5+ mph from where you know you need to be to get next level interest, it makes little sense to play summer ball. Spend your effort developing your raw tools, and once you get there, work to refine them. Refined 88 mph pitchers don‚Äôt draw scouting interest, and the only 88 mph pitchers who you‚Äôve seen in the big leagues (like Hendricks or Maddux) can or did throw 93 when they burst into the league, and earned the right to stay with below average velo by pure domination alone. Even Bartolo Colon (who now only throws in the 88-91 range), used to throw upper 90s when he was first in the league, so keep in mind that your stuff does have to be at least average for what guys at the next level have, otherwise you better have something else extraordinary (like throwing 88 from submarine, a ball that moves 2 feet, or 1 in 10,000 command like Maddux).
Recommendation: take the summer off to develop your stuff
‚Äî
Your fastball is within a couple of where it needs to be, but you‚Äôre working on refining your command, consistency or an off-speed pitch. You‚Äôve been invited to pitch in the Cape Cod league or another highly competitive summer league. In this case, more live innings (assuming you weren‚Äôt abused in spring ball), is exactly what you need to keep working on refining the stuff that you already have. It‚Äôs still important to keep training and eating properly in-season, but the car has been built. Now, it‚Äôs time to learn how to drive it.
Recommendation: play ball.
‚Äî
A common criticism of the velocity training crowd is that we are just selling false dreams at achieving pro status, when a majority of those pursuing it, oftentimes against coaches wishes, won‚Äôt ever actualize this dream.
‚ÄúJust take pride in being a good pitcher and getting hitters out at your current level and abilities. There is pride in being a good college pitcher and hanging up the spikes after 4 years.‚Äù
To that, I say three things.
1) There is absolutely pride in being a good pitcher. Nobody is forcing anyone to train his stuff, especially if that player has no desire to play at the next level (or doesn‚Äôt feel he has the capability of doing so). This is totally cool. I‚Äôve played with some guys who accepted from the start of their four years that their careers would end, and they had fantastic college careers (more successful than mine ever was, despite getting drafted). This is admirable.
Here‚Äôs the flip side ‚Äì coaches, I‚Äôm talking to you:
2) If a player has it in his heart that his goal is to get to the next level, no matter how far-fetched you think that goal, and you pressure him into settling, try to talk him out of working to improve his raw stuff, or tell him that he isn‚Äôt capable of making it any further in the game‚Ä¶
Fuck you.
Cut him or bench him if he‚Äôs not yet good enough to pitch for your team. Have a heart to heart with him if you truly believe he‚Äôs misguided..but don‚Äôt forcibly stand in the way of a kid‚Äôs goals because of what you think they¬†should be.
3)¬†Here‚Äôs the third reality: chasing rabidly after a dream that you actually care about, pushing through failure and clawing your way towards the limits of your abilities teaches an athlete far more about how to win¬†at life than obediently stifling that dream and following orders. Dream big. Make mistakes. Learn from them. In the process you will learn far more about yourself than the athlete who was just ‚Äúgifted‚Äù his abilities.
Call it corny (I guess it is), but it‚Äôs true.
‚Äî
Playing summer ball can definitely be a good decision, but so can smart and hard training on an intelligently designed program. Most guys aren‚Äôt where they need to be as far as lean body mass or strength/power metrics. Many guys could stand to go through a structured weighted ball/long toss regimen rather than ride buses and eat Wendy‚Äôs all summer just to snag 22 innings pitched. Hell, my biggest jump in velo came between age 21 and 22, following the only summer of college that I took off from competing. Can summer ball be a good call? Sure, but you have to understand the context. It‚Äôs up to you to weigh the pros and cons of each in making your decision.

Customized Mechanics: Lateral Power,2016-11-10T21:05:48+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/customized-mechanics-lateral-power/,"Today we are going to start talking about assessing what kind of engine each pitcher has under the hood and how it plays a role in customizing mechanics.¬† Going back to my race car analogy that I‚Äôve used in previous articles in this series we can think of the first two traits, limb length and mobility, as the car frame and model.¬† These give us an idea of what kind of car we have to work with while the rest of the profile lets us know what kind of engine we are dealing with how much horse power it can produce.
The rest of the traits on the physical profile not only tells us how much force they can produce but more importantly how they produce it!!
We saw evidence of this when we looked at two very different pitchers, Stroman and Sanchez, in part 1¬†who produce 95 mph worth of horsepower but they go about it very differently relying on their strengths as an athlete.¬† The goal here is to tailor mechanics to suit the athlete and the kind of force they can produce rather than forcing the athlete to adapt to cookie cutter mechanics.
What‚Äôs more exciting is that the engine an athlete currently has can be improved through proper training to enhance their areas of strength‚Äôs while also addressing areas of weakness. ¬†This means that the engine building process is adaptable.¬† The secret is getting each athlete to adapt to the right kind of training.
The number of physical traits on the profile makes it easy to see how there are thousands of different options when it comes to designing a training program for each player with their own unique profile.¬† For example, some guys need to stretch their muscles to create a larger range of motion while playing long toss and performing a well-designed plyometric training program to develop speed.
While others would benefit more from doing specific drills to learn how to control their entire range of motion and placing more emphasis on traditional weight room exercises to gain both size and strength. The secret is finding the most effective and efficient way through the 1000‚Äôs of options which is the exact reason we need to test and assess each athlete in a variety of tests that give us a broader sense of their muscular system.
So lets get started and explore the physical trait of ‚ÄúLateral Power.‚Äù
‚Äî
The ability to produce power in a lateral direction is a key performance indicator (KPI).¬† Sure I am might be a little biased since this was the topic of my thesis but I just merely backed up what smart people in the baseball performance industry already knew to be true anecdotally.¬† If you want to learn more about this read my interview with Eric Cressey¬†who was one of those smart people I was talking about.
In business KPI‚Äôs are described as quantifiable measurements that help track success.¬† If you are in the business of throwing hard then its in your best interest to track and measure your ability to jump laterally off of your right leg towards your left (switch if you‚Äôre a south paw).¬†¬†¬† The reason that you want to do this is because it is the best test that you can use without any equipment other than a tape measure to help determine your ability to throw hard.
The lateral jump out performed all of these common and not so common tests that I ran 40+ college baseball players through for my study.
> 60 yard dash
> 10 yard dash
> Medicine ball squat & throw
> Medicine ball scoop & throw
> Vertical jump
> Single leg vertical jump R&L
> Hop & Stop
> Broad jump
> Triple broad jump
> Ten yard hop test
The goal of the study was to simply see if any of them correlated to higher throwing velocities and the lateral jump was the hands down winner.¬† It‚Äôs not to say that all of these other tests aren‚Äôt useful because most of them are valuable. ¬†A lot of them will be discussed in the next couple of articles because of the information that they provide in developing a better picture of other of muscular traits and the type of engine an athlete has to work with.
‚Äî
Stand on your right leg and mark the inside of that foot as the starting point.¬† Load up on the right leg and jump as far as you can to your left while landing on both of your feet.¬† Both feet have to land at the same time and can be no further than a couple of inches apart.¬† Mark the outside of your right foot and measure the distance to the starting point.
‚Äî
Here are the results from the my study. ¬†I have some more number from other athletes I‚Äôve tested in the past but this one was obviously the most accurate in regards to the testing conditions and repeat-ability.¬† I encourage you to play around with this test yourself but let‚Äôs use these numbers to start.
‚Äî
The simple way of looking at it is if someone can jump out beyond 74 inches but can‚Äôt throw harder than 80 mph then that guy needs to work other parts of his mechanics because his throwing velocity isn‚Äôt reaching its potential based on the amount of force he can produce from the back leg.¬† There‚Äôs lots of power coming in but not much coming out which means that there is a leak somewhere up the chain!!!
In a study back in 1998 by MacWilliams et al. they found that while there was a high correlation in the amount of force that the back leg produced and throwing velocity that there were cases where more force resulted in slower velocity. ¬† Not everyone is going to be able to handle the forces like Carter Capps‚Äô does with his mechanics that produce high 90‚Äôs stuff.
We also know that the front leg produces the highest forces making it the limiting factor.¬† If your front leg (aka the brakes) aren‚Äôt strong enough to handle the amount of force that the back leg ¬†(aka the gas pedal) can produce then bad things are going to happen.¬† You should only drive as fast as your brakes can handle for pure safety reasons.¬† We will talk in depth about the brakes when I discussed deceleration and eccentric strength.
The ability to laterally jump far only means that you have a lot of ‚Äúmotor potential‚Äù for throwing hard.¬† Motor Potential is term that in his book ‚ÄúSpecial Strength Training Manual for Coaches‚Äù ¬†Dr. Verkoshansky, one of the best sport scientist in history, describes as :
The muscular capacity to produce the greatest quantity of mechanical energy per unit of time
Throwing a baseball hard requires producing a lot of energy in a very short amount of time but Dr. Verkoshansky goes onto to talk about the importance of what he calls ‚Äútechnical mastery‚Äù which he describes as
The athlete‚Äôs skill to effectively express his motor-potential in competition
This brings us to the situation where an athlete can throw harder than 80 mph while not being able to jump further than 72 inches.¬† This athlete can be considered to have a high level of ‚Äútechnical mastery‚Äù This athlete is transferring a high amount of force from the back leg all the up to the ball but when there isn‚Äôt enough force to start with there isn‚Äôt much you can do.¬† Spending more time developing lateral power and increasing motor potential with this athlete would be a better use of time and resources, namely time and energy. ¬†Increasing ones lateral jump is a subject that I will touch on when we explore the other traits of the physical profile.
‚Äî
While the lateral jump test is great I have been trying to find ways to make it better.¬† Here are a couple of ways that I have adapted how I test and record the Lateral Jump as I‚Äôve continued to learn myself.
‚Äî
If all we did was look at the distance each player could jump we would be missing out on half of the equation that makes up the kind of power than we are interested in measuring.¬† Looking at the distance gives us an idea of how fast an athlete is because of the fact that jumping requires muscles to produce as much force in the shortest amount of time possible, think back to the motor potential description above.
‚ÄúBody weight is always a contributing factor to throwing velocity and in fact it was right up there with lateral jump distance as being the best predictor of throwing velocity.‚Äù
The other half of the equation for power is force which is the mass/body weight of the pitcher.¬† I‚Äôve spoken at length about how important it is to look at vertical jump POWER by taking body weight into consideration by using formulas that sport scientists have produced since not many of us have access to expensive force plates.
Body weight is always a contributing factor to throwing velocity and in fact it was right up there with lateral jump distance as being the best predictor of throwing velocity.¬† So it would be obvious to combine these two tests into one super test!
The problem is there isn‚Äôt one to my knowledge and I haven‚Äôt had much success when I try to use the formula for vertical jump since the two types of jumping are very different.¬† I have however came across a formula designed for the broad jump in a conversation I had with Dr. Bryan Mann who is another name you will hear me talk about in the near future because he is the world‚Äôs top expert on velocity based training.¬† If you haven‚Äôt heard of him it‚Äôs because the velocity we are talking about is barbell speed rather than ball speed.
Since this new formula is designed for a horizontal jump it does a lot better job of giving us an idea of how much POWER a player can produce going laterally and horizontally. ¬†It‚Äôs not perfect but better and if anyone does know of another formula or has access to a really expensive force plate that can measure force in every vector let me know.¬† I‚Äôll talk more about this formula and my spread sheet that I have been building to help build these profiles when I sum up this series.
‚Äî
To take this test a step further and make it even better I am going to steal a concept I learnt from Kevin Neeld. ¬†Kevin is one of the world‚Äôs top authority in training hockey players and since I live in Canada I deal with a lot of hockey players and I have really found Kevin‚Äôs blog to be a top resource, check it out here.¬† Hockey is another sport that is seeing the value of the lateral jump since it shares many more traits to the skating motion than either the vertical or broad jump making it the most specific to the sport.
Kevin is a very smart guy and he took this test to a whole new level by taking into consideration other factors that could affect the test result of a lateral jump.¬† He highlights these three areas:
> Limb length
> Flexibility
> Hip structure
I will quickly go over these but check out his blog post about the subject to get a better understanding.
It‚Äôs easy to see how having longer legs would make it easier just to step rather than jump side ways which doesn‚Äôt do a good job of seeing how athletic that player is. So by taking this distance into consideration we can get a better idea of how far each player can jump relatively to their leg length.
It also makes sense to see if maybe someone has really tight groin muscles and can‚Äôt even spread their legs apart making this test difficult for them because of a mobility issue.
What was really interesting is how Kevin goes even deeper to think about hip structure because they aren‚Äôt all built the same and some are designed to move laterally than others. Check out the different pelvic types as well as femurs to see how the hip joint can be very different from one person to the next.
‚Äî
While it isn‚Äôt really feasible to see exactly what kind of hip structure each player has it is an interesting topic.¬† Check out this quick preview of a lecture from Dr. Stuart McGill where he highlights how different people from different areas of the world have different types of hip structure and how some hips are made for squatting while others are better designed for sprinting. ¬†Take the 4 minutes to watch video to see the importance of this kind of information.
‚Äî
The test is simple ‚Äì how far can you can each athlete spread their feet apart while not having their hands on the ground? ¬†Check out Kevin‚Äôs blog for how he puts this number into an equation to get an adapted score.¬† The beauty is that your score here will be the result of which out of these three factors limits you most.
Seeing how wide a player can stand with their feet apart I think is a great idea for pitching coaches to do with all of their players.¬† This number can be considered their max distance for their stride length unless you employ the jumping style that Carter Capps showed us before.¬† If someone can‚Äôt spread their legs out because of a limitation of limb length, flexibility or hip structure you might not want to tell them to stride 90% of their height.¬† Maybe their hips are more suited for rotation and by striding out further you are restricting this ability to twist and rotate.
‚Äî
The fact that comparing left and right lateral jump score has the potential to help screen athletes for preventable injuries should actually be considered the main reason why we perform this test in the first place rather than a bonus.
Large discrepancies between left and right could mean that you are more at risk for injuries.¬† Think about a car that can produces more force on one side versus the other.¬† Over time the car frame will begin to break down because of torque from the uneven power production.¬† Sure we will see that most pitchers can jump further from their pitching back leg since they have practiced this movement so much more but if we start to see anything greater than 20% it might set off some red flags.
‚Äî
This test is so easy to perform and gives us a lot of information that makes it a no brainer.¬† While it is a good test on its own we are starting to see how things can be improved when we look deeper and take into consideration other parts of the profile and how they interact with one another. ¬†We will touch on it again as we make our way through the rest of the profile. ¬†Next up ‚Äì deceleration and eccentric strength which should be another good one. ¬†I will try to keep it shorter than this one but thank you for making it to the end!!!

The Definitive Guide to Belt Squatting (without a machine),2016-09-20T19:21:42+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/belt-squat-to-throw-harder/,"Coaches and athletes alike know that following an injury, detraining (and soon after, atrophy) is imminent. This is unacceptable if you want to throw harder, however most of us accept this as inevitable, using the injury as an excuse to back off of all heavy lifting and spending precious weeks (or months) training to regain lost strength and size.
But what if you‚Äôre a competitive athlete and don‚Äôt have the luxury of time on your side? Or worse yet, what if you have a chronic injury that won‚Äôt just disappear with several weeks ‚Äì or months of rest and rehab.
What if you could build lower body strength and power every bit as impressive as you want and train to throw harder, without high shear or compressive spinal loading?
I‚Äôm not here to bash squatting and deadlifting, as they should stay the cornerstone of any healthy athlete‚Äôs regimen provided they can be performed with proper form. Still, most of us can think of some time in our athletic careers when our low backs didn‚Äôt feel quite right, and we could have used a pain free substitute.
I‚Äôm not just talking about shifting from squats to lunges. I‚Äôve been at the point where 40 pound lunges or even bodyweight Romanian deadlifts presented with lower back pain, but I was still able to use the belt squat¬†to obliterate my lower body and go through the same fundamental movement patterns, 100% pain free.
‚Äî
The premise is simple.
By hanging the weight from the pelvis (rather than placing it on the shoulders), the compressive loading bypasses the spine.
Even for fully functional, healthy athletes, belt squats still represent a good option for occasional deloading from heavy spinal loading periodically throughout the year or during particularly high-stress mesocycles (such as in-season for athletes).
‚Äî
I‚Äôm going to assume, like 99% of the population, you don‚Äôt have access to a $3,000 belt squat machine.
If you do, great.
If not, here is the ONLY set-up I‚Äôve found that is comfortable and safe enough to load up to any appreciable degree.
‚Äî
15‚Ä≥ IronMind Loading Pin
‚Äî
Alternatively, you can create your own bizarre homemade contraption that will likely get you kicked out of your local Planet Fitness
45 pound plates may require too wide of a stance to be comfortable for shorter athletes, in which case you may need to use 35lb plates.
You‚Äôll want a Spud Inc Belt Squat Belt or a Super Squats Hip Belt. Both of these are extremely comfortable even with heavy weights. While the Super Squats hip belt is quite a bit over-priced, it can also be used for the belt lunges (shown below), unlike the spud belt.
Set-up in front of a squat rack. You can either hold onto the squat rack directly for balance, or set up a barbell in the squat rack to use as a handle bar for a counter balance during the squat. This allows you to sit back into the squat quite a bit more, which allows for a more vertical shin angle and takes pressure off of the knees. Alternatively, you can try doing the exercise without a squat rack (below) and severely limit the loading¬†and stability that makes our version such a money squat substitute.
No spinal loading, but also no lower body loading either.
‚Äî
Use stable boxes to stand on and place a couple heavy dumbbells against the boxes to prevent any outward slipping during the set.
For safety purposes, you‚Äôll want to try to adjust the depth so that the bottom of the squat leaves the weight just at or above ground level. This way, if you were to fail a rep, you can just lower the weight the extra half-inch to the ground.
If you don‚Äôt have a spotter, you‚Äôll need to begin the exercise by lifting the weight out of the bottom on your own. Don‚Äôt panic. Just adjust the belt low on your hips, step up onto the boxes one foot at a time and make sure to push your hips back to get the weight up for the first rep. The only limitation to this setup is that you‚Äôll have trouble getting that first rep up on your own going any heavier than a 5 or 6-rep max. When using that type of weight, you‚Äôll need a spotter.
‚Äî
Start with¬†a 4-8‚Äù box under the loaded weight pin, and at the start of each set, lift the weights up and have a spotter pull the box out from under the stack to clear room for the rep. This makes it drastically easier to get the weight up on the first rep. At the end of the set, wait until the spotter slides the box back and carefully lower the weight down.
Execution Tips:
> Sit back deep into the squat, driving your hips back and aiming to keep a more vertical shin-angle (this is more reminiscent of box squat form ‚Äì you can certainly do more upright versions to mimic front squats if you wish).
> Drive explosively through the heels, aiming to accelerate the weight as fast as possible like you‚Äôre trying to jump out of the bottom of the lift (this is extremely important from a power output standpoint).
> Use as little assistance from your arms as possible ‚Äì the squat rack is to be used to add stability and as a counterbalance, but you should not be actively trying to pull yourself up out of the bottom with your arms.
‚Äî
Just as with squatting, belt squats can be used in a variety of rep ranges based on the performance goal.
Strength: Warm up to 3-4 sets of 4-6 reps using >75% of 1-rep max (favorites: 4√ó5, 3√ó6, 6√ó4, etc)
Hypertrophy: Warm up to 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps using 60-75% of 1-rep max (favorites: 3√ó12, 4√ó10, 5√ó8)
Power: Warm up to 4-8 sets of 2 to 3 reps, using 50-70% of 1-rep max (favorites: 8√ó2, 6√ó3, 4√ó3). If you can add band tension here, that‚Äôs preferable as it will encourage acceleration through lockout and also help prevent any swinging of the loading pin after lockout.
Quick tip: One easy way to add more power work into your program is to treat all of your warm-up sets, even on heavy days, as power sets. For example, if you‚Äôre working up to 300 lbs for 3√ó8, you might spend 3-5 sets working up to that weight, and treat these submaximal sets as power sets, aiming to accelerate the weight as quickly as possible, rather than just coasting through these sets.
‚Äî
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, low back injuries are nothing to play around with. But once a medical professional has cleared an athlete for basic movements like bodyweight lunges and squats, he should be able to begin progressively loading the belt squat as well.
Many coaches don‚Äôt understand how to effectively load up the lower body without a barbell, and are overly conservative. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been told to just do bodyweight squats or to goblet squat with a light dumbbell as though that were a legitimate substitute for strength work. These exercises will not help you throw harder.
This dude has some epic short shorts, but those 5lb dumbbells aren‚Äôt doing much for his leg strength or helping him throw harder.
While these may be useful as part of a comprehensive low back rehabilitation plan, belt squats in addition to a gradual reintroduction to spinal loading will allow for a quicker recovery of pre-injury lower body strength levels.
Master this set-up and you‚Äôll reap all the benefits of regular squatting as you simultaneously work towards getting your body back to 100%.

Throw Harder Fastballs By Improving Your External Rotation,2016-08-05T02:44:09+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/external-rotation-throw-harder/,"Loose. Whippy. Free-and-easy. Making it look effortless to throw harder.
These terms have existed in the scouting lexicon for decades as the ‚Äúuncoachables‚Äù for anyone looking to throw harder. You either have it or you don‚Äôt ‚Äìreferring in large part to the arm‚Äôs ability to lay back up to¬†180 degrees or more into external rotation before being catapulted forwards into internal rotation at upwards of 7,500 degrees per second.
But why is external rotation so important? And second, can it actually be trained, despite conventional baseball wisdom? Let‚Äôs find out.
Billy Wagner‚Äôs external rotation, notice the forward trunk flexion and almost 190 degrees of external rotation.
‚Äî
Quite simply, increased external rotation provides a greater arc of motion over which force can be applied to the baseball, which allows you to throw harder.. In professional pitchers, degrees of external rotation range from 160 degrees on the low end all the way up to 185 degrees or more. According to a paper by Seroyer et al. (2010),
Extreme degrees of external rotation of the shoulder, coupled with forward linear trunk motion, allow a greater distance for the accelerating force to be applied to the ball, generating top velocity.
Worth noting, not all of this motion is true gleno-humeral ‚Äúball-in-socket‚Äù rotation ‚Äì to get Billy Wagner type layback, you‚Äôre not just looking at excellent external rotation, you also need:
> Exceptional t-spine extension (to help delay internal rotation even longer)
> Excellent t-spine rotation (to keep the shoulders fully closed, storing energy as the hips fully open into landing ‚Äì watch Chapman below)
> Excellent scapular posterior tilt (clears room for true ER to occur, and effectively increases external rotation by delaying internal rotation)
> A long history of throwing (humeral retroversion ‚Äì the actual warping of the humeral head itself, was shown to account for about 10.6 degrees of increased external rotation motion in pro pitchers who have been throwing since childhood)
‚Äî
The short answer is NO.
Pro pitchers tend to fall between 160 and 185 degrees of external rotation, so external rotation alone is not the only factor that determines big-league velocity (and velocity is only one piece of actual pitching performance).
Noah Syndergaard doesn‚Äôt have the most whippy arm on the field,¬†but he can throw hard.
‚Äî
Still, external rotation is one critical component, and most of the very hardest throwers in the big leagues are closer to the upper end of that range.
It‚Äôs worth noting that more than this upper range isn‚Äôt necessarily better ‚Äì hyper-mobility beyond these ranges may actually be detrimental to velocity (not to mention potentially dangerous), so be extremely careful seeking extra motion if you already fall in the upper end of this range.‚Äú
To the point above, my buddy Mike Shawaryn probably doesn‚Äôt need to be working to improve his external rotation:
Remember, external rotation increases the distance over which force can be applied to the baseball, but other factors such as arm length, hip/shoulder separation and shoulder horizontal abduction (sometimes interchangeably called ‚Äúscap loading‚Äù) play a role as well.
It stands to reason that if external rotation is towards the lower end, one can ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for it, at least in part, by being excellent at the other qualities that go into mechanical efficiency and velocity (including factors such as raw strength/power).
While there is a lot that goes into it, here are 4 quick ways you can begin to improve your external rotation, IF you are a candidate for it.
‚Äî
Basic assessment: You should be able to lay with a medium sized foam roller under your mid-back with your hands clasped behind your head and get close to touching your elbows and back of the head to the floor without extending through your lumbar spine or your butt coming off the floor. This is a crude test but it is generally enough to¬†give a good first impression of how¬†well (or not) your T-spine extends. For rotation,¬†you should be able to get around 45 degrees (or perhaps slightly more to your arm side) in a seated t-spine rotation test.
If this is not possible, or is highly forced, you‚Äôve got some work to do‚Ä¶
Remember, improving external rotation isn‚Äôt really just about external rotation. A big portion of this is having the mobility within the thoracic spine to extend/rotate to gain additional range of motion over which to apply force.
So let‚Äôs mobilize those vertebrae.
Once you gain new range, you‚Äôll want to strengthen within that new range. Some examples of this are: properly performed front squats and anteriorly loaded lifts like front rack reverse lunges, and anti-rotation core movements at various angles (such as Paloff Press variations).
‚Äî
Tightness in the muscles that internally rotate / horizontally adduct the humerus and anteriorly tilt the scapula will inhibit your ability to externally rotate and achieve clean layback.
Case in point: if your pec major, pec minor, lats and subscapularis get tight, good luck having free and easy external rotation.
> Establishing new range: targeting these muscles can be done in part with self-myofascial release exercises like the¬†Pec Barbell Smash, but we have also seen guys have¬†success with partner manual release techniques for the pecs, subscap and lats. These are brutally effective, but¬†outside the scope of this article to discuss.
> Strengthening new range:¬†Again, once full range is achieved (or if you already have full range), you‚Äôre going to want to solidify and strengthen that new range in your training. This means full range of motion dumbbell bench presses, full range upper body pulling movements, and a progressively increased throwing program.
‚Äî
Though less common than tight muscles on the front side (pec minor, subscap), we have seen examples of external rotation limited by prior injuries or poor tissue quality on the back of the shoulder and scapula as well.
While we recommend seeking out a qualified manual therapist to identify if these exist, here are some areas to be extra aware of (especially if you have a previous injury history of that area or extremely tender trigger points):
> Teres minor
> Infraspinatus
> Rhomboids
> Levator scap
These spots can be pinpointed fairly well using a partner‚Äôs thumbs/elbows, lacrosse ball, tennis ball, or Thera-Cane.
‚Äî
Sometimes, tissue restrictions aren‚Äôt always the issue from the start, or, even once they have been addressed, external rotation still hasn‚Äôt changed substantially.
This is where constraint drills using overweight implements like Plyocare balls and wrist weights really shine. ¬†From my 2014 article,
With a heavier object (to a point), there‚Äôs more resistance for your arm and body to use as a guide through space and time. You¬†must¬†conserve the momentum of the ball on the arm‚Äôs downswing, and efficiently transition and transfer force throughout the arm path to execute the throw with any sort of intent or fluidity.
If you have an egregious timing issue or hitch in your arm path, the heavier the weighted ball, the harder it will be to get away with flaws. The more efficient your arm will have to become in order to propel the object with any meaningful amount of force.
For example, try throwing a football with a long arm swing behind your body or with an inverted-L position at landing ‚Äì it just won‚Äôt happen. Your arm is guided by the constraints of the task (the shape, weight of the object, the target, etc.). In this case, the heavier weight is a very loud and constant feedback loop that makes it incredibly difficult and awkward to have massive arm action inefficiencies.
Additionally, overweight implements help encourage external rotation by driving the arm into layback.
‚ÄúNote: if the weight of the ball is so heavy that relaxing into the throw is not possible (especially for youth or smaller athletes) back off slightly on the ball weight.‚Äú
I don‚Äôt use a 2kg on myself for this reason, because I feel my arm tensing up rather than loosely relaxing into layback.
While overload implements are king for remapping external rotation and efficient arm paths, underload implements are king for transferring these newfound paths to throw harder by increasing arm speed and velocity.
Once you have successfully changed your arm path, it may not make sense to¬†spend 90% of your time continuing to throw hard heavy balls at max effort, and may instead make more sense just using them to groove good patterns at lower intensities and volumes. Try devoting more of your time (and higher intensity throws) to the lighter end of the spectrum.
‚Äî
You have a tight arm, but it‚Äôs not a death sentence to your career or throwing harder. Implementing these four factors may just be the tip of the iceberg, but it‚Äôs a damn good place to start. Furthermore, recognize that you will see gains in external just from throwing over the course of the season, so don‚Äôt freak out if you are only 5 or 10 degrees off of where you want¬†to be. Also, remember that external rotation is just one of many factors that contribute to velocity, and that not everybody is a solid candidate for seeking more external.
My recommendation‚Ä¶ start learning, start testing, and start thinking.
Your career is entirely in your hands.

Strength Training for Baseball and Isolation Exercises,2016-02-12T01:34:39+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/strength-training-baseball-isolation-exercises/,"Both the large pectoral and lat muscles play a huge role in the arm acceleration phase of the pitching motion (1). A study on high-level pitchers showed that EMG activity of the throwing arm pec during ball acceleration reached 54% of MVC (maximum voluntary contraction), while activity of the lat reached 88% of MVC.
The latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major are highly active during the arm acceleration phase. As such, training these muscles for force production is wise.
Besides these primary movers, the subscapularis also demonstrated high activity during this acceleration phase, playing a¬†role in dynamic stabilization of the shoulder by acting to maintain the ball-in-socket positioning of the humerus in the glenoid. For the sake of this article, we won‚Äôt worry about this rotator cuff muscle.
Gabe trains lats. Gabe throws 98. Be like Gabe.
‚Äî
What all this boring science¬†super awesome data tells us is that both the pecs and lats play a central role in throwing force production and ball acceleration.
Whoop-dee-doo.
Most of you already knew that, which is why you train rows, presses and other upper body movements that involve these muscles.
While the¬†pecs and lats¬†receive stimulation in traditional compound exercises like push-ups, bench press, dumbbell rows and pull-ups, these exercises generally fail to fully stimulate these muscle fibers.
The first muscle group to fail in the majority of pressing movements is the triceps brachii, NOT the pecs (do a set of push-ups to failure if you‚Äôre not convinced ‚Äì this is why bodybuilders do partial range of motion bench presses to emphasize the pecs).
Furthermore, the first muscle group to fail in the majority of rowing movements is the biceps brachii, leaving under-stimulated and under-fatigued lat muscle fibers.
The latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major are not fully stimulated during most compound upper body movements. This leaves the door open for targeted isolation training.
‚Äî
Instead of going over to the dumbbell rack to add in extra bicep and tricep work (after you have just crushed these muscles with rowing and pressing variations), a better option would be to perform post-exhaustion training techniques for the pecs and lats.
Post-exhaustion refers to a training technique that involves further stimulating a muscle group using a single-joint exercise, following partial¬†stimulation of that same muscle group using a multi-joint, compound exercise.
A1) Single Arm Dumbbell Rows¬†3√ó6-8
A2) Kneeling Straight Arm Pulldown¬†3√ó10-12
As you can see, post-exhaustion training¬†takes a compound exercise and pairs it with a complementary isolation exercise.
Rowing movements are paired with lat isolation exercises, and pressing movements are paired with pec isolation exercises.
It‚Äôs worth noting that post-exhaustion training is not the only effective way to incorporate these isolation exercises into your programs ‚Äì some athletes and coaches prefer to add them in at the end of the workout as opposed to supersetting them so as not to take away from the weight that can be used on the main compound movement of the day.
Whatever floats your boat.
‚Äî
Years of improper training (e.g. partial range of motion) while neglecting soft tissue quality can lead to problematic tissue restrictions. This is why tissue work (foam rolling, lax ball work, manual therapy techniques, etc.) is so crucial for maintaining adequate range of motion and function.
Even if you have already built up significant restrictions, there is still hope.
I‚Äôve seen pitchers who were unable to straighten their elbow past 110 degrees regain full range of motion following 1 month of daily manual therapy. For more minor restrictions, significant progress can be made within a couple weeks.
The bottom line is this ‚Äì training your muscles to be strong isn‚Äôt synonymous with losing range of motion. In fact, by both training through full ranges of motion and addressing individual tissue restrictions, our athletes are able to improve upon both metrics simultaneously.
‚Äî
Here‚Äôs a sample day of offseason training that incorporates post-exhaustion training for the pecs and lats.
Begin with movement prep (soft tissue work, individual-specific corrective exercises, dynamic warm up and activation/plyometric drills)
A1) Neutral Grip Dumbbell Floor Press 3√ó5-8
A2) 3-way Band Chest Flies 3√ó6 each position
B1) Neutral Grip Lat Pulldown w/ slow eccentric 3√ó6-10
B2) Supine Band Pullover 3√ó10-12
C1) Push-up to 1 Arm Support 2√ó6/side
C2) Half-kneeling cable row 2√ó10-12
Finish with shoulder pre-hab/accessory¬†work + static¬†stretching if needed.
‚Äî
Incorporating lat and pec isolation work is¬†a subtle change, but one that will kickstart growth in these under-stimulated and critical muscles. By adding mass and strength, while staying on top of your soft tissue quality, you will set yourself up to maximize their contribution to your throwing velocity.

Grunting to Improve Throwing Velociy,2016-01-17T22:25:10+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/grunting-increases-velocity-by-5/,"Today‚Äôs article comes to you from Graeme Lehman (MSc, CSCS). Graeme¬†has extensive practical and academic experience in the field of baseball strength and conditioning. He can be reached by email¬†or through his website. This article was originally published¬†on his blog¬†and can be viewed there as well.
Just a couple of days ago I was flipping back and forth between channels watching a couple of great match ups of high level athletes going¬†head to head.¬† On one channel David Price and Jeff Samardzija where trading punches with 95+ mph fastball‚Äôs while on the other channel Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer were on centre court in Monte Carlo going toe to toe.
What I found interesting was that all four of these elite level athletes grunted every time they either threw or hit the ball.
Grunting isn‚Äôt something that you see/hear in baseball all the time but the fact that both of these flame throwers grunted on every pitch made me think that there must be something to it.¬† In tennis grunting is part of the game and is the sport most people associated with grunting.
Tennis, just like baseball, relies heavily on velocity created through rotational power which made me think that there is something that we in the baseball world can learn and apply to our sport.
Being the baseball and exercise science nerd that I am, it made me curious to see if grunting could in fact increase throwing velocity.¬† So I fired up the computer and starting to look on Pub Med for some academic research papers on this subject.¬† While I couldn‚Äôt find anything related to baseball and grunting, I did find one on tennis:
‚Äî
When I quickly read through the abstract the final sentence had me hooked with this quote:
‚ÄúThe velocity, force, and peak muscle activity during the tennis serve and forehand strokes are significantly enhanced when athletes are allowed to grunt.‚Äù
This study had players hit forehands and serves with or without a ‚Äúgrunt‚Äù.¬† The results below clearly showed that grunting increased velocity by about 5%.
What‚Äôs interesting is that some of the subjects, who were all NCAA tennis players, didn‚Äôt actually grunt when they played tennis but still displayed a velocity increase when they were asked to grunt during the study.
‚Äî
In this study they described a grunt as a force full expiration of air.¬† In some martial arts it is known as a ‚Äúkiap‚Äù or ‚Äúkiai‚Äù which has been shown to increase handgrip force by 7% (Welch and Tschampl).
Be sure to grunt if you have to test your grip strength for an increase of 7%!!!
This forceful expiration is thought to provide some core stability with this bracing method.¬† There is another method of bracing the core through forceful inhalation known as the Valsalva maneuver. ¬†This however but has been shown to increase blood pressure and mean arterial pressure and could lead to what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúweight-lifter‚Äôs‚Äù blackout, probably something you want to stay away from.¬† The fact that grunting allows air to escape makes it much safer.
‚Äî
The exact mechanisms that explains how grunting allows us to create more force is actually a little complicated and I am working on trying to understand it a little better myself.¬† Because of this I will directly quote the authors here for the reason why the pectoralis major and the external oblique muscles were able to create more force when grunting:
‚ÄúThe parallel pathways from the central command feedforward effects of the motor cortex passing through the medullary respiratory neurons, which help recruit thoracic trunk musculature.‚Äù
Sounds complicated I know.¬† It is basically saying that a by-product of forceful expiration (the medullary respiratory neurons part) causes more muscles in the core (thoracic trunk) to be stimulated.¬† There were a couple of other theories that were equally as complicated but we will just stick to this one for now.
‚Äî
This line from the research paper helps sum up the reason why velocity can be increased with grunting:
‚ÄúIncreased dynamic and static force production occurs when the trunk is in a more stable position‚Äù
When your trunk/core is more stable it allows other muscles to produce more force both dynamically (moving) or statically (stationary).¬† This is vital for throwing hard because we need some muscles to produce movement while others provide stationary stability to allow those moving parts to move faster.
Sometimes we need muscles to play both roles at different times of the throwing action and this quote from Kovacs et al. (2008) backs this up, in the tennis world anyways:
‚ÄúAbdominal muscles accelerate and stabilize the trunk during serves.‚Äù
The muscles of the trunk, for example, need to fire to produce rotational power through movement (dynamic) but they also need to fire in order to produce stability (static) to allow optimal transfer of energy.¬† It‚Äôs this ‚Äústiffening up‚Äù of the trunk that passes the energy we have already produced from the legs, hips and trunk onto the shoulders and arms.
‚Äî
In this study the stable trunk allowed the pectoralis major to produce more force.¬† The pectoralis major is as the authors put it ‚Äúthe primary accelerator‚Äù during the serve and forehand.¬† When we throw a baseball the pectoralis major is the primary muscle responsible for internal rotation of the shoulder so it‚Äôs pretty important for baseball too.¬† Please don‚Äôt read this and just go bench press to build better ‚Äúpecs,‚Äù as it‚Äôs more complicated than that.
‚Äî
Just like anything else in pitching it really comes down to timing.¬† There are times when you want your muscles to be stiff and strong but there are times when you want your muscles to be fast and relaxed.¬† If you try grunting the whole time and try to ‚Äúmuscle‚Äù the ball to the plate the radar gun will show a decrease in velocity.¬† Below is a quick little chart about the characteristics of muscles when they are contracted (aka turned on) and relaxed (aka turned off).
One of the real secrets to enhanced athletic performance is the ability to quickly switch between contracting and relaxing your muscles.¬† In fact elite level athletes can relax muscles up to 8x faster (Matveyev ‚Äì 1981).¬† Going back and forth from contracted to relaxed muscles has been coined the double impulse theory.
This double impulse theory has been shown to take place in sports like MMA and golf (McGill 2014 & 2010). ¬†These are two sports that are completely different from one another, yet they share the importance of having the ability to both contract and relax muscles quickly, especially the muscles of the core.
In both cases, when they look at the pattern of muscle contraction and relaxation researchers could clearly see muscles being activated at the start of the swing or punch followed by a relaxation of the muscles followed by another activation of the muscles upon impact.
McGill et al. (2014) ‚Äì Muscles of the core when throwing a Jab.
The first peak is when they initiate the punch and the second peak happens upon impact.¬† It‚Äôs that valley between the two peaks that allows for hand to move quickly.
The relaxation between muscles contractions as you can see from the chart above is what allows the muscles (and the bones they are attached too) to move quickly.¬† Try tensing and flexing your arm through the entire punching motion and you will see how slow your arm moves.
Another important part of the relaxation is that it is going to reduce fatigue.¬† Contracting your muscles takes energy and as a result causes a lot of fatigue quickly which means that you get tired in a hurry.
‚Äî
Once the back leg has initiated the momentum towards home plate it‚Äôs time for hips and trunk to produce some rotational power.¬† This is when we would see the initial contraction from some of the muscles in the trunk and core.¬† In order to get a lot of rotational speed in the trunk we need relaxation like we discussed above but we also need some range of motion.
The importance of having some range of motion is that speed takes time to develop and if you are limited in your range of motion then you will limit your ability to produce trunk rotation speed.¬† We see this when you look at shoulder mobility.¬† We need lots of external rotation in order to build up lots of internal rotation velocity.
If the range is small you have less time to build up speed
This range of motion in the trunk is basically describing hip and shoulder separation. ¬†And in this case a lack of hip mobility (abduction and internal rotation) would be your limiting factor in not giving our trunk enough time to build up world-class speed. ¬†Thoracic spine (t-spine) mobility would also be a limiting factor.
Two ways of measuring hip internal rotation ‚Äì seated and prone
*side note: too much mobility can be a bad thing too since it makes it harder to harness this power ‚Äì for more info check out this¬†great research paper¬†from Dr. Andrew Robb*
Once your trunk has built up that speed and is now facing home plate it is time to transfer this speed and energy to the shoulder and throwing arm.¬† This is again where we need these muscles to contract and stiffen up so that as much energy as possible is available to help whip the relaxed throwing arm as fast as possible.
By the way this is when you grunt.
Hopefully you have found this information to be useful.¬† I know that is has made me think about more questions but my conclusion would be that grunting would definitely provide some benefit. Better yet, a quieter form of exhalation so that baseball doesn‚Äôt go down this same road as tennis where I have to watch the game on mute.
The main part is making sure that the athlete knows and understands the importance of the roles that both muscle strength and muscle relaxation play in throwing.
And if you are going to implement grunting make sure you do it on every pitch so that you don‚Äôt tip off when you are throwing something off-speed.

Practical Application (comments by Ben Brewster). Many historically hard throwers, like Nolan Ryan, were famous for grunting. Having previously tested this idea in the past along with several teammates, there appears to be a consistent 1-2 mph bump in velocity from grunting among already hard throwers. In all cases, (there were about 6 of us who tried it), the 2-3 grunting fastballs we mixed in were the hardest pitches of the outings. This isn‚Äôt to say one should grunt every pitch, or that it will lend itself to throwing strikes, but it is interesting information to take into consideration, nonetheless.

Baseball Home Gym to Pitch Harder,2016-01-11T04:38:00+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/home-gym/,"Today‚Äôs article comes to you from Coan McAlpine, left-handed pitcher with TreadAthletics. From age 12 until age 18 he trained almost exclusively in a small room at his house, under the supervision of his older brother, going from a low 70s lefty at age 15 to a 6‚Äô4‚Äù 230+ pounder touching 92 in high school.
‚Äî
I entered high school with high hopes.
I was 14 years old, 6‚Äô0‚Äù tall and left-handed. I had potential. At the time, I viewed high school as a stepping-stone to the next level and beyond; however, things didn‚Äôt continue to come so easily‚Ä¶
Natural ability, my ‚Äúgenetics,‚Äù began to ensure me less and less. I soon realized that being a low-70s left handed pitcher characterized me as ‚Äúanother soft lefty.‚Äù
I refused to be defined by this category.
Without access to fancy equipment, and a 13‚Äôx9‚Äô empty room, I devised a plan that would get me to my goals.
What I learned along the way: a good program, guidance, consistency, and a mastery of the basics will go much further than flashy facilities or the latest training fads.
The secret behind most transformations is that there is no secret. It took years and years of progression before I began to approach the player I wanted to be.
Too often, players jump to the sexy stuff before they have earned the right to do so.
They start a fancy plyometric program before they can squat their bodyweight for reps.
They spend $400 on a new baseball bat or glove every year when that money would be better spent on their own personal development.
Here are the top 3 reasons why this 13‚Äôx9‚Äô room was a blessing for my development.
Some recent training footage.
‚Äî
Most kids from my area had access to fancy gyms with all of the accessories‚Ä¶ the Lat Pulldown Machine, the Pull-up Assist Machine, the Curl Machine, and so on.
Oh, BOY! All of the possibilities.
I had to focus on the essentials as accessibility filtered out the unnecessary.
Looking back, dialing down on the fluff and progressing the meat and potatoes was the best thing I could have done.
I didn‚Äôt waste time testing all 50 machines in a commercial gym, or getting overwhelmed by misinformation.
Instead, I was properly taught about 10 key movements at age 12, and I spent the next 6 years working to progress and perfect them.
Fancy gyms are a minefield of distractions and white noise.
Very little of it matters.
The machines, fancy clothes, sweatbands, shaker bottles and pre-workout shakes.
The elaborate exercises and the 18 different bicep curl variations.
The ego.
Who do you become when you unrack the bar? How much better are you today than yesterday?
That‚Äôs what matters.
They say a four-hundred dollar¬†bat can‚Äôt fix a four-dollar swing.
I would add that a multi-million dollar training facility can‚Äôt fix broken programming, a lack of desire and improper coaching.
My suggestion: take pride in mastering the basics. Get piss strong. Have a qualified coach and mentor there to expedite your process. We spend too much time obsessing over what all of the other kids have, when the answer is laying right in front of us.
As my brother and mentor always reminded me,
‚ÄúControl what you can control. Believe in the process. Control your inputs; monitor your outputs.‚Äù
These words still ring in my ears to this day.
‚Äî
‚ÄúSome of you, you spend so much time with other people, you spend so much time trying to get people to like you, trying to fit in that you don‚Äôt even know who you are. You study them, you know about them, you wanna hang out like them, you wanna be just like them. You‚Äôve invested so much time in them that you don‚Äôt know who you are. I challenge you to spend time by yourself. I challenge you to take yourself out.‚Äù¬† ¬† ¬†-Eric Thomas
Spend enough time training in a little room and you will get to know yourself.
You either figure out a way to develop confidence and work ethic, or you quit.
These things I can promise.
Training alone teaches you to embrace the suck.
Nobody is there to hold your hand ‚Äì it becomes a battle against yourself.
My brother was my trainer, but he went off to college when I was 13. We kept in touch daily. But, for all intents and purposes, I trained alone in my home gym for most of my early career.
Fun? No.
Lonely? At times.
But I had a vision for myself and trusted that the process would get me there.
Training partners can be invaluable ‚Äì but I firmly believe that athletes need to also be comfortable training when nobody is watching.
When nobody is pushing you.
When it‚Äôs just you against you.
This is how you discover what you‚Äôre really made of.
‚Äî
Without distractions, and with only a handful of lifts to focus on, there is no option but to progress.
If progress stalls, there are less variables to worry about.
Over-recovered? You probably need more training volume to continue adapting.
Under-recovered? You probably need to address recovery and take a deload week.
Fairly simple.
Focusing on what matters, (and tracking/progressing it relative to your own personal bests) is the best way to continue making gains.
Working in a group environment begins to add in other factors like ego and peer pressure, and take away from an internally focused mindset.
Remember: it‚Äôs you vs. you.
It does not matter if the other kids are able to out-lift you in a particular exercise or even all exercises. You are where you are. Now, it‚Äôs up to you to change it. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. Identify the latter and train them.
‚Äî
Although I no longer train full time in that 13‚Äôx9‚Äô room, it is what set the foundation for my training career.
That room helped define me.
It bled over into my habits, my training, and my work ethic.
It influenced me at the plate, on the mound, in the classroom, and in every other facet of my life.
Before you spend massive effort debating the little things, or wondering if the latest training gimmick is the magic bullet to your success, take a step back and first ask if you have a mastery of the basics.
Oftentimes, the answer is staring you right in the face.

How Pitchers Can Gain Weight,2015-12-22T22:48:17+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/top-6-reasons/,"It‚Äôs that time of year again ‚Äì the heart of the offseason. These are the precious short months where true progress can be made both in the weight room and the kitchen to a competitive pitcher‚Äôs body. Unfortunately, most skinny pitchers continue to make the same basic mistakes year after year, declaring that they can‚Äôt gain weight and blaming their genetics for their struggles.
While genetics do play a role in your ability to gain muscle mass, most people are nowhere close to their genetic limit. Can you guess who this handsome devil 6‚Äô3‚Ä≥ 155 pounder on the left was?
To the right is also me, 65 pounds heavier.
I have never worked with an athlete who has been unable to put on weight, size and strength (in fact, many of our skinny pitchers who swore they could never gain weight put on 15-25 lbs in their first 3 months). Here is a countdown of the 6 most common way pitchers unknowingly cripple their ability to put on size, strength and velocity.
‚Äî
Breaking news: showing up to the weight room 3-4 times per week doesn‚Äôt guarantee progress. Most pitchers assume that by consistently showing up and following any old program, they will be optimizing their strength, size and athleticism. This isn‚Äôt how physiology works.
Getting stronger and stimulating muscle growth (hypertrophy) requires an overload stimulus (increased volume, intensity or both). This is all well and good, except for the fact that many coaches don‚Äôt track progress. No, I‚Äôm not talking about the personal trainer named Paulo who works at your local Planet Fitness. There are college ‚Äì and even some professional teams who don‚Äôt use tracking charts or monitor if progress is being made. But I digress‚Ä¶
This is training blind.
An athlete needs to be able to follow a planned progression for each movement and/or muscle group, AND his coach must have a way of evaluating how well that progression is actually working.
This goes for accessory movements too.
How are you progressing your external rotation work? Just doing 3 sets of 10 with a light band will stop providing benefit after a certain point. What about abdominal work? Many coaches progress their main lifts and fail to plan out progressions for accessory lifts ‚Äì if an exercise is worth including in a training program, it‚Äôs worth progressing.
Week 1: 4x:30 w/ 45 lbs
Week 2: 2x:30 w/ 60 lbs, 2x:45 w/ 45 lbs
Week 3: 2x:30 w/ 75 lbs, 2x:60 w/ 45 lbs
Week 4: 2√ó30 w/ 90 lbs, 2√ó30 w/ 60 lbs
Etc.
This leads into number five‚Ä¶
‚Äî
The need for exercise variety is vastly overblown in the sports performance industry.
When I worked with Christian Meister, helping get him from 205 to 215 lbs in roughly 6 weeks (and from 96 to 100 mph on pull downs in that time), we used FOUR primary exercises in a very basic, 3-day-per week program.
> His box squat went from 185 lbs for 5 to 275 lbs for 5.
> His dumbbell bench went from 60lbs for 8 to 80lbs for 8
> His dumbbell row went from 70 lbs for 8 to 100 lbs for 8
> His barbell lunges went from 125 lbs for 6 to 185 lbs for 6.
Again, all of this was in under 6 weeks.
We continued progressing all of his arm care and scapular integrity work as well, but for him the goal was keeping it simple and effective.
Does this mean that exercise variety has no value? Of course not! But rotating exercises too frequently can make progress difficult to measure.
Once you find your bread-and-butter movements, stick to them and give them time to progress. Varying volume, intensity, tempo, etc. in these movements within a planned progression will benefit an athlete more than mixing up his exercises every time progress stalls.
‚Äî
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know where you are going, any road will get you there.‚Äù -Lewis Carroll
Athletes and coaches need to be on the same page. What is the end goal of this training phase? Of the entire offseason?
Pitchers always seem to want big biceps need goal numbers to work towards on each of their lifts. Understanding how to set realistic goal metrics for each individual is a critical coaching tool for getting the most out of each player.
Suddenly, Johnny Wholestaff isn‚Äôt just squatting to squat. He is squatting to get his max from 275lbs to 315lbs in 12 weeks, knowing that larger and more powerful hip and knee extensors will help propel him more explosively down the mound and potentially aid his throwing velocity.
‚Äî
This one is a bit misleading. It‚Äôs not that pitchers who struggle to gain weight are not trying their best to eat a lot of food, it‚Äôs that they are going about it the wrong way.
They may be eating ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of food relative to what they usually eat, or relative to what their buddies eat. Their body may be giving signals of fullness too, which leads pitchers to assume they are eating ‚Äúenough.‚Äù
The issue with this approach is, of course, subjectivity.
For hardgainers, especially those with small appetites, relying on the body‚Äôs own regulatory mechanisms is ineffective. The body will try to resist change via overfeeding through feelings of fullness, increases in metabolism, and others.
[thrive_text_block color=‚Äùblue‚Äù headline=‚Äù‚Äù] The best way to ensure a consistent caloric surplus is for pitchers to actually track what they are eating and how their bodyweight and strength metrics are responding.[/thrive_text_block]
Again, this comes back to tracking everything so that when something doesn‚Äôt progress as planned, you can make an informed adjustment to the plan.
‚Äî
The volume of the food you‚Äôre eating doesn‚Äôt matter as much as the caloric density of that food. There‚Äôs a reason veggies, chicken breast, oatmeal and rice are classic fat-loss foods: they are extremely filling relative to the calories they provide. Good luck eating 1,500 calories of chicken breast and rice for dinner, months on end. It‚Äôs not going to happen.
Instead, place a larger emphasis on calorie dense foods. Chicken thighs over chicken breasts, full fat dairy over low fat dairy, you get the idea. At the end of the day, calories in vs. calories out decide if a pitcher is gaining weight or not.
Not necessarily the foods to be basing a 4,000+ calorie diet around.
‚Äî
*Gasp* did you just say not to eat clean foods?
Not at all! We still encourage our athletes to eat these types of foods, but many find it difficult to hit high calorie goals if this is all that they are eating. What I‚Äôm getting at is¬†that the concept of ‚Äúclean‚Äù vs. ‚Äúdirty‚Äù is flawed. Remember, very few foods are actively bad for us ‚Äì in moderation. What we are really talking about is nutrient density and caloric density. ‚ÄúDirty‚Äù foods tend to be highly processed foods that have low nutrient density and high caloric density ‚Äì while small amounts of these types of foods in the midst of a well balance diet won‚Äôt hurt performance, basing an entire daily intake around these can lead to deficiencies. ‚ÄúClean‚Äù foods tend to be unprocessed foods that have high nutrient density and low caloric density. This isn‚Äôt ideal for gaining weight either, if it‚Äôs all an athlete consumes.
While neither ‚Äúclean‚Äù nor ‚Äúdirty‚Äù foods need¬†be¬†100% avoided, we recommend basing the bulk of the diet around¬†minimally processed foods that have high caloric density ‚Äì full fat meats, nuts, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, milk and avocados.
That‚Äôs more like it
‚Äî
Processed foods are not inherently harmful. The issue with eating a largely processed-food diet is that it can lead to macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies. However, for an individual on an extremely high calorie diet that is based around whole foods, this is rarely an issue. As such, it can be helpful to allow some flexibility within which foods are allowed if it means the difference between a pitcher hitting their calorie goals or not by the end of the day.
We recommend that 80% of the diet come from whole foods, and up to 20% come from foods that would otherwise not be ‚Äúallowed‚Äù ‚Äì pizza, ice cream, whatever it takes to hit a calorie and macronutrient goal at the end of the day, within reason. We aren‚Äôt talking about excessive binge eating to 8,000 calories or 75% of ones diet sliding towards these types of foods.
Picture the athlete who struggles to gain weight and is deciding whether to go to sleep at 3,600 calories on the day or push to his goal of 4,200. In this case, crushing a milkshake¬†is a far better option than missing out on those calories altogether.
‚Äî
Have you ever tried eating 4 or 5,000 calories a day while spending 4 hours in class and 5 hours at the baseball field? It‚Äôs not easy.
Given that most athletes settle into the norm of eating just three meals per day, this would mean absurdly¬†sized meals.
As a general rule of thumb, you should be eating at least one meal per 800-1,000 calories of your daily goal. This means at LEAST 5 large meals for a 5,000 calorie goal, 4 large meals for a 4,000 calorie goal, etc.
Doing this on the go doesn‚Äôt have to be tough ‚Äì here are some food options for pitchers to keep in their bags for quick 800-1,000+ calorie meals on the go.
‚Äî
> 2.5 peanut butter sandwiches (~900 calories)
> 2 granola bars (~400 calories), 2 flour tortillas (~400 calories), 1 large handful trail mix (~200 calories)
> 16 oz. chocolate milk (~400 calories), 3 large handfuls of trail mix (~600 calories)
‚Äî
If pitchers keep these types of items with them at ALL TIMES, there is never an excuse to not get their calories in. I have athletes who scarf down handfuls of trail mix in between sets during their training sessions, finishing with an effortless extra 800 calories on the day.
Keep in mind, this approach still assumes 3 large, square, whole food meals each day ‚Äì these snacks are for those sometimes tough-to-squeeze-in 4th or 5th meals that most pitchers end up skipping.
‚Äî
At the end of the day, some pitchers simply won‚Äôt be willing to do what it takes to put on weight. It‚Äôs easy to bring energy for 90 minutes, 4 days a week in training. It‚Äôs much more difficult to pay attention every other waking minute to the fuel you put into your body, getting to bed on time, and doing the unsexy work that differentiates the good from the great.
This, more than anything, is what separates those who want it, from those who are content to continue gliding by on whatever natural talent they have.
There are so many athletes who have all the talent in the world, but simply aren‚Äôt willing to make themselves uncomfortable.
It‚Äôs not easy, and that‚Äôs the point.
The sooner your pitchers start treating their weight gain as an all-out battle, the sooner they will start seeing those self-imposed barriers crumble.
It‚Äôs time to get to work.

Auto-Regulation for Baseball,2015-08-19T06:11:00+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/throw-harder-and-recover-quicker-with-auto-regulation/,"Effective¬†throwing programs progressively increase volume and/or intensity over time. This gradually increased stress allows the arm to safely adapt to new workloads and get stronger.
Whether this means increasing or varying the daily/weekly number of throws, the intensity/distance of those throws, or the weights of the balls being thrown, there are a number of approaches that pitchers have successfully used for building arm strength and increasing velocity. That‚Äôs not what this article is about.
Here‚Äôs the problem with most¬†aggressive, potentially effective throwing programs:
Most programs¬†don‚Äôt account for how your arm is feeling on a day-to-day basis.
No matter how good something looks on paper, it won‚Äôt be optimal¬†if it‚Äôs not flexible; life gets in the way. Recovery varies from day to day and week to week, and different players adapt at different rates for a wide number of reasons.
But there is hope.
In 5 minutes, I‚Äôll show you how to use auto-regulation¬†to make sure you are always pushing your arm to newer and better heights, while ensuring that¬†you don‚Äôt expose yourself to any undue risk of injury.
We‚Äôre going to discuss¬†how one might apply it to a structured long toss program, although it can and should be used in other contexts as well.
‚Äî
Auto-regulation¬†is not as scary or revolutionary as it might sound at first. In fact, everyone auto-regulates to some degree. Let‚Äôs first define the term:
The idea is simply to adjust the training stress to match the athlete‚Äôs¬†psychological and physical readiness. In other words, athletes¬†are not going to be able to perform at their absolute peak every single day.¬†On days where they are fully ready and recovered, the training should reflect that, while on days where they may be under-recovered, the training they perform should reflect that as well.
A rigid throwing program can take an educated guess at how a pitcher will be feeling the next day based on the previous throwing session, but it can‚Äôt¬†control for each and every¬†factor that may come up or for individual variation.
By having auto-regulation¬†built into the throwing program, you can account for these fluctuations in recovery and performance and make optimal progress.
Interestingly, studies have already begun to show promise¬†for¬†auto-regulation as it relates to strength training,¬†although there is no reason the same concept should not be applied to throwing as well.
In a nutshell, auto-regulation could be summarized as ‚Äúlistening to your arm.‚Äù Throw more on days you feel great, throw less on days you don‚Äôt. This¬†is actually quite good, if vague, advice.
It‚Äôs much¬†like telling somebody to just ‚Äúlisten to their body‚Äù when they weight train ‚Äì it‚Äôs not wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt help a whole lot without some sort of quantification or system to accompany¬†it.
Let‚Äôs figure out how to quantify this concept and apply it to an actual sample throwing program.
‚Äî
Quantifying readiness on a 10-point scale
To begin to put concrete numbers to this concept of auto-regulation, we must first have a way of quantifying how ready a thrower is on a given day. The simplest way we propose is to use a subjective 10-point scale.
‚ÄúHow does your arm feel today?‚Äù
The score is whatever the athlete feels is their arm‚Äôs (and body‚Äôs) overall level of freshness on a 10-point scale.
Note: On some days, this may not be clear until a minute or two into playing catch. At this point, continue on to whichever corresponding throwing session¬†matches that level of readiness.
This table is an example of¬†a week of auto-regulated throwing. Notice how the athlete‚Äôs¬†readiness corresponds to the resulting throwing session performed: 1) Max effort, 2) Moderate effort, 3) Low effort or 4) Off. Notice also how, in this example, every other day is a scheduled¬†off-day. This is different from taking a non-scheduled off-day which should happen rarely, if ever.
Now let‚Äôs talk about what all this means:
‚Äî
To be done on days where your arm feels fresh and ready. Subjectively, this means a readiness score of 8 out of 10 or better.
Example throwing session: work out to 97-100%+ of max long toss distance for 5 to 10 throws. Do 5-15 max effort pull-down compression throws on the way in. End with optional flat ground work (10-20 throws at 75-85%).
‚Äî
To be done on days where your arm has a little fatigue and/or normal soreness. ¬†Subjectively, this means about a 5 to 7 out of 10.
Example throwing session: work out to 75 to 90% of max distance for 5 to 10 throws. Optional pull-down compression throws on the way in, no more than 5 to 8 at 90% intensity. End with optional flat ground work (5 to 15 throws at 65 to 75% effort).
‚Äî
To be done on days where your arm has significant soreness or fatigue, but is not in pain or ‚Äúhanging.‚Äù Subjectively, this means about a 3 to 5 out of 10.
Example throwing session: work out to about 50 to 60% of max distance on a loose arc. No pull-down compression throws on the way in. Optional flat ground work ‚Äì no more than 10 to 15 throws at about 50 to 60% intensity.
‚Äî
When the arm is ‚Äúhanging‚Äù or painful or extremely fatigued, this is not a day to throw.
What to do:¬†go through the full warm up and arm care work, but¬†skip the throwing session¬†and re-assess on the following day. These unscheduled off-days should happen very rarely, if ever, on a well auto-regulated off-season throwing program.
‚Äî
Again, this program is just an example of a thousand ways to lay out an off-season throwing program. We are not saying you should necessarily do this one. However, this is a useful approximation of what intensities correspond to what long toss distances for a given player‚Äôs max distance and velocity.
Note: these values will vary from player to player, particularly for pitchers who have significantly different mound mechanics vs. long toss mechanics or have a funky arm slot. Still, this is quite accurate for the vast majority of pitchers out there.
‚Äî
For any program to be optimal, whether it‚Äôs a strength training or throwing program, it needs to be able to adjust based on how the athlete is¬†actually responding and recovering to it. Powering through workouts or throwing sessions when under-recovered will increase the likelihood of burnout and injury, while breezing through easy sessions when fully recovered will fail to¬†take full advantage of the athlete‚Äôs capabilities.
Structured auto-regulation¬†takes this into account, allowing you to carefully tread the balance between ‚Äútoo much‚Äù and ‚Äúnot enough,‚Äù making for safe and optimal progress.

Simple Hacks to Throw Faster,2015-08-01T08:10:37+00:00,https://treadathletics.com/4-mechanical-hacks-i-learned-from-fernando-rodney-that-helped-me-throw-95-mph/,"Big league pitchers throw gas. The average velocity has continued climbing in recent years, with an unprecedented number of pitchers¬†throwing in the upper 90‚Äôs¬†and touching triple digits. Even in the minor leagues,¬†dozens of pitchers¬†have been clocked at these ridiculous speeds, which can be discouraging for those of us who don‚Äôt have the same rocket launcher for a pitching arm.
At a glance, you might¬†write all of these guys off as ‚Äúgenetic‚Äù freaks, who throw hard just because they were ‚Äúblessed‚Äù with a good arm.¬†A closer inspection reveals that not all of these guys are physical specimens ‚Äì many of them¬†just move better, with subtle biomechanical similarities that allow them to get more out of their bodies.
This article will show you how I transitioned from a 88-90 mph pitcher (touching 91) to 90-94 mph (touching 95) in large part by implementing three mechanical hacks.
‚Äî
Let me explain what I mean by this.
Efficient mechanics, for our purposes,¬†are movement patterns that lend themselves to high force production capabilities AND have minimal energy leakage between segments.
In other words, the ability to produce a lot of force is great, but without the ability to smoothly or seamlessly transfer that force through the legs, hips, torso, shoulder, elbow, etc. less of that¬†force is¬†going to end up being transferred into the ball.
What this indicates¬†is that harder throwers generally have more efficient mechanics than slower throwers ‚Äì they are able to transfer the most force into the baseball.
Harder throwers also tend to be taller, with longer arms, more muscle mass, etc. making it hard to narrow down the cause of their elite velocity. In other words, one could argue Chris Sale throws hard because of his 6‚Äô10‚Äù wingspan or Kenley Jansen does because of his massive size (6‚Äô5‚Ä≥ 265lbs).
Small, skinny pitchers¬†have everything working against them. To throw flames, they need unbelievably efficient mechanics.
These are the guys worth studying.
‚Äî
Throwing exclusively out of a slide-step from a funky side-arm slot, I took a special interest in Rodney‚Äôs motion, as I was just at 88-90 mph heading into my senior year of college.
Here‚Äôs the motion:
So what exactly caught my eye? How is he able to generate such high velocities out of such a (relatively) small frame?
Let‚Äôs get to it:
‚Äî
Not only does he hold his front hip closed and internally rotated until the absolute last moment before landing, he keeps his upper body stacked over his back hip to build tension in his core and¬†counter-rotates¬†his shoulders (showing his numbers to the batter) to build even more potential torque once his front foot lands.
Most MLB pitchers do a good¬†job of staying back and closed, but Rodney does it to an even more extreme degree.
Remember: Rodney isn‚Äôt 6‚Äô4‚Ä≥ 230lbs like Stephen Strasburg or Gerrit Cole, so to throw with similar velocity he has to have more ‚Äúextreme‚Äù or ‚Äúefficient‚Äù mechanics. We aren‚Äôt necessarily talking about ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù mechanics from a durability or injury prevention standpoint, just ‚Äúefficient‚Äù from an energy transfer and force production standpoint.
Other flamethrowers who stay closed with their lower body as long as possible and add in some extreme shoulder counter-rotation include:
Bob Feller, Hall of Famer
Aroldis Chapman ‚Äì 105 mph
Lance McCullers jr., 100 mph (in high school)
‚Äî
The first tweak I toyed with was therefore to overemphasize keeping my front hip closed while counter-rotating my shoulders.
‚Äî
Check it out:
Not only that, but the direction of this drive is¬†directly¬†at his target (horizontal as opposed to vertical), allowing him to create a ton of linear energy early in his motion that can then be captured as rotational energy once his front foot lands.
The second tweak I toyed with was therefore to drive hard off my back leg, keeping my upper body ‚Äústacked‚Äù over my back hip (imagine your spinal vertebrae maintaining an upright, stacked position) while engaging my glutes and hamstrings. Doing so creates maximum ‚Äúlinear distraction‚Äù ‚Äì a disconnect between the lower half and the upper half that puts the torso on stretch and allows for greater resulting¬†velocities. For more, Trevor Bauer discusses this concept here.
‚Äî
Fernando Rodney‚Äôs extension at release
‚Äî
Rodney doesn‚Äôt just spin through release or finish the pitch half-heartedly. He¬†pulls down with ferocity, propelling his upper body way¬†over his lead leg and maximizing his average sized body and levers.
‚Äî
My mechanics didn‚Äôt do a 180¬†in one day. These were tweaks I fooled around with over the course of the summer before my senior year of college. However, here‚Äôs what happened.
-My long toss quickly¬†went from 315 to 330 feet to 350 to 380 feet on my best day once I got comfortable with the tweaks. These maxes were from a slide-step, as I prefer to¬†not¬†use a crow-hop in my long toss (I‚Äôll cover why in a future post). The difference: using my lower half and overemphasizing staying closed allowed me to get so much more torque and smoothly connect my arm to the resulting torso¬†rotation. It was free and easy, not labored like it had felt before. In essence, I was no longer throwing ‚Äúall-arm.‚Äù
-In case these numbers don‚Äôt mean much to you, that‚Äôs pretty close to what most mid 90‚Äôs throwers can do. Sure enough, that fall I was able to touch 93 for the first time‚Ä¶on flat ground.
-When I did finally do a ‚Äúcrow-hop,‚Äù in three throws I hit 98, 100 and 102 mph. Although these would suggest that my mound velocities would sit in the mid 90s, the disparity is that my arm slot is much lower in game (almost straight sidearm).
My arm slot
Nonetheless, I was able to hit 95 for the first time that spring, on a cold day in February. Though I certainly never felt like this was my ‚Äúpeak,‚Äù it was a landmark I had earned, and that was in large part credited towards the mechanical changes I toyed with here.
‚Äî
I‚Äôm not saying you need to imitate Rodney‚Äôs mechanics, or try to copy all the 100 mph throwers in the MLB.
The point of this is to show that the elite pitchers don‚Äôt simply throw as hard as they do because they have ‚Äúfast arms‚Äù or are ‚Äúfreaks.‚Äù
Sure, they‚Äôre generally¬†stronger and bigger¬†than¬†the average high school or college arm, but the hardest (and smallest) throwers actually move more efficiently as well, utilizing the kinetic chain to their advantage.
The only way to understand this is to¬†feel it.¬†When a tiny tweak causes the ball to¬†rocket out of your arm with¬†less effort, you begin to see how big of a deal mechanical efficiency is.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì getting strong as hell is important ‚Äì this is your base (I‚Äôm simply never going to throw slower than say‚Ä¶87 or 88 mph, even if I push the ball¬†with horrendous mechanics,¬†because of my size, flexibility and strength). However, truly optimizing your velocity requires highly efficient movement combined with that base of strength and power.
Remember, small tweaks can have a big impact¬†when it comes to the difference between good and great velocity. The great ones are sometimes freaks (like 6‚Äô10‚Äù Randy Johnson), but generally they just get the most out of their bodies and get into positions that look unfamiliar to the rest of us:
Javelin throwers recognize this, always working not just to max out their bodies, but to get ‚Äúin and out of‚Äù the extreme positions that the¬†very best in the world are able to.
The biomechanics are slightly different, but we could all learn a thing or two from this approach when it comes to training for athletic performance and velocity development.
I, for one, certainly have.
The greatest javelin thrower ever, Jan Zelezny
‚Äî
It‚Äôs time to get to work. Unlocking your velocity potential isn‚Äôt just about one or two magical fixes. It‚Äôs about addressing the small details that, added up, contribute to significant results. It‚Äôs about mechanical efficiency, strength, athleticism, mobility, intent and so much more.
Our coaching programs carefully assess each athlete‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses and build a training program around them. No stone should be left unturned when it comes to chasing your dream.
Here‚Äôs to reaching your potential,
