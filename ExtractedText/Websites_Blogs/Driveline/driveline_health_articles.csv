What if We Could Make Throwing Rehab Better? Doing my dissertation at Driveline Baseball - Driveline Baseball,2021-12-02T02:59:04+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/12/what-if-we-could-make-throwing-rehab-better-doing-my-dissertation-at-driveline-baseball/,"By Kyle Wasserberger, PhD, CSCS
This was the question at the heart of my dissertation. The premise: Pitchers are always going to get injured. Despite our best efforts, and no matter how good we get at reducing them, injuries are still going to happen (picture the little Dutch boy plugging the hole in the dike).
If we accept that injuries will never not be a thing, it begs the question: What if we could minimize the impact of those injuries that do still happen? What if we could get athletes back from injury faster, or better prepared to handle the demands of competition, or both?
When it comes to research, we (and by we I mean the sports medicine and sports science research communities) already devote considerable time, effort, and resources studying how to fend off injuries before they happen. Conversely, research aimed at minimizing the time and labor costs of the rehabilitation process is less common. Why not try and attack the injury problem from both directions? Yes, we should try to prevent as many injuries as we can. But, we should try just as hard (if not harder) to make the recovery process as smooth and efficient as possible for those injuries that do still happen.
Throwing rehabilitation programs prepare injured players to handle the demands placed on them during competition in as little time as possible. We can break down this process into three steps:
1. Start with small, tolerable throwing workloads
2. Gradually and systematically increase throwing workloads
3. Repeat until the athlete can tolerate workloads similar to those found in competition
These steps are reflected in the typical interval throwing program: Athletes start with relatively few throws at a relatively short distance. Over the course of several weeks, athletes perform more and more throws from longer and longer distances. Eventually, athletes return to the pitching mound and gradually increase their pitching workload. After passing enough checkpoints, they’re allowed to return to competition.
Current interval throwing programs rely primarily on throw number and throw distance, integrated with subjective feedback from the athlete about how their arm feels. More recently we have seen calls for radar gun inclusion to provide quantitative throwing intensity feedback. But what if there was a way to quantify throwing workload and intensity not only by how many throws you made and how far/fast you threw them, but by estimating the stress experienced by the throwing arm? What if we could integrate biomechanical analysis into the interval throwing program?
With my dissertation I wanted to gather information that could eventually be used to improve throwing rehabilitation protocols. In short, I wanted to know whether players responded differently to similar changes in throwing intensity (as measured by velo). If players respond differently, then it’s possible that more program individualization could be beneficial. What if a set increase in throwing intensity was a challenge for Player A but not a big deal for Player B? If both players were keeping the same rehab timeline, then either Player A would be progressing too fast, risking a setback, or Player B would be progressing too slow, costing valuable playing time.
To examine whether different players responded differently to increases in throwing intensities, I needed to quantify the loads placed on the throwing arm throughout the throwing intensity “spectrum” (i.e. starting at “first throws of the day” intensity, progressing all the way to maximum effort throwing). I brought players into the motion capture lab and recorded their mechanics as they performed a typical throwing warm up. Players were verbally instructed to progress from minimum to maximum intensity at their own pace. I then built a biomechanical model for each athlete and estimated the loads on the shoulder and elbow for every throw. The result was a joint load vs. velo curve unique to each athlete. Two such curves are emphasized in the figure below…
In total, I collected data on 1,318 throws from 36 players, 32 of which I could use for my dissertation. Once I had the biomechanical data, I had to model each athlete’s curve statistically. To do this, I turned to mixed-effects modeling, a technique used commonly in fields like quantitative psychology but rarely used in biomechanics.
For those unaware, mixed-effects modeling (aka multilevel modeling, hierarchical modeling, and plenty of other names) is a statistical analysis technique which takes nested data (i.e. throws nested within athletes, students nested within classrooms, voters nested within political districts, etc.) and builds a regression model for each “group” in context of the data as a whole (in my case, each group was an athlete). The athlete-level model quantifies the within-athlete relationship between throwing intensity and throwing arm joint loading, while the whole-data model quantifies the average athlete-level model across my entire sample. This approach makes mixed-effects models well suited for examining within- and between-athlete relationships at the same time. My question was not just “what’s the relationship between joint loading and velo?” but (simultaneously) “what’s the relationship between joint loading and velo and is that relationship different between athletes?”, which includes one within-athlete question and one between-athlete question.
Anyways, at first glance, the first half of my question (“What’s the relationship between joint loading and velo?”) is pretty straightforward. We already know that as velo goes up, so does joint loading. But I was more interested in whether the increase in joint loading for a given increase in velo was consistent across the entire throwing intensity spectrum. In statistical language: Was the within-athlete relationship between velo and joint loading linear or nonlinear?
Although previous research out of ASMI has shown a strong linear relationship between velo and elbow valgus torque per unit bodyweight height, this relationship was only shown for game-effort throwing from a mound. What about submaximal intensity throws? What about flatground throws? Since most of the throwing rehab program is not performed at game-effort and not performed from a pitching mound, there was definitely a gap in the research that I felt should be addressed. Including the entire throwing intensity spectrum would increase the applicability of my findings to rehab settings.
Once I established the within-athlete relationship between velo and joint loading across the entire throwing intensity spectrum, I wanted to see if that relationship differed between athletes. This is where mixed-effects modeling can shine. By allowing each athlete to have their own regression line, I could estimate the regression equation parameters for everyone in my sample (recall that I’m modeling each athlete as a combination of the “average” model across the entire athlete sample (sometimes called fixed effects) plus some deviation from that average (sometimes called random effects). If athletes didn’t differ much in their responses to increases in throwing intensity, then the random effects would be small and the fixed effects by themselves would suffice. If athletes did show differences in their joint loading vs. velo relationship, then including random effects would fit the data better.
Let’s revisit the figure from earlier showing shoulder rotation torque on the x-axis and velo on the y-axis, but this time with the fixed-effects-only model added.
Overall, there are some pretty distinct nonlinear trends in the data (at least at the group level), indicating that the relationship between velo and throwing arm joint loading may not be linear throughout the entire throwing intensity spectrum. Additionally, you can see Player A is consistently above and to the left of the average model, indicating that they threw faster than average for a given level of shoulder rotation torque, while Player B is slightly below and to the right of the average model, indicating that they threw slower than average for a given level of shoulder rotation torque.
In addition to overall position on the plot, we can look at the slope of the individual athlete regression lines. Player A shows a steeper slope with less plateauing than Player B. A steeper slope represents a greater increase in velo for a set increase in shoulder rotation torque. In this fictional scenario, if Player A and Player B were both going through a radar-gun guided rehabilitation program and prescribed the same intensity increase for the next phase of their program, Player A may not be challenged enough or Player B may be challenged too much. Either would be sub-optimal and could cost the player and their team playing time and money.
What’s the deal here? Why do Player A and Player B have different regression lines? What does having different regression lines even mean, and does it have ramifications for throwing rehab protocols? Is this stuff even worth the extra effort or is the standard interval throwing program good enough?
We’re only just getting started down this line of research and, while some of these questions are more easily answered than others, the takeaway here is that mixed-effects modeling gives us a framework for answering them where more common analysis techniques may fall short. Simultaneous modeling of within- and between-athlete phenomena through mixed-effects models can help address the limitations of applying group-based inferences to the individual, as well as the limitations of extrapolating single-subject results across diverse training populations.
Stay tuned. In the next part of this blog, we’ll dive into  how we can build up our model to try to explain the between-athlete differences and how Driveline Pulse may be able to help.

Levels App: Continuous Glucose Monitors Review - Driveline Baseball,2021-10-14T23:30:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/10/levels-app-continuous-glucose-monitors-review/,"By Spencer Medick, Pitching Coordinator
At Driveline, we’re known for objectively measuring performance criteria, and making training recommendations based on that information. With an increase in wearable biometric tracking devices available to the public, we decided to test out Levels to get quantitative insights on nutrition and compare that to scientific literature to evaluate how nutrition can affect performance.
This will be a comprehensive literature review on nutrition, primarily around blood glucose, as well as a product review of the Levels app, and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) as a whole. If you’re not interested in taking a deep dive, but want the basic, science-backed 411 on nutrition, we’ll start there.
There are general heuristics:
But everyone has a slightly different response to food types, meals, timing, and quantity. If optimizing health or peak performance is your goal, it could be wise to find out what works best for you.
Ever wonder why almost every diet seems to have tribalistic followers who swear by it, while others say it’s complete garbage? Well, that’s because people have various responses to different meal types, timing, and even individual foods—though hardly anyone eats a single food in complete isolation. A well-known study by Zeevi, et. al. revealed a high degree of interpersonal variability in postprandial response between identical meals. That’s a fancy way of saying that the same meal activated different cascades of internal responses and pathways in different people.
Rather than demonizing foods or following recent health crazes, find out what your body can handle, and what it can’t. But before we get into that, let’s look at what factors can affect responses to food, because food is fuel.
Ever been jealous of a friend who’s jacked and can eat whatever they want? Well, despite what you may have been told, it’s not entirely genetics. While it’s true that you can’t out-train a crap diet, having more muscle mass significantly increases both insulin sensitivity—your body’s ability to deal with a large bout of glucose consumption—and the amount of energy you’ll need to fuel your muscles. In a study by Andersen, et. al., when controlling for amount of body mass, more muscle was correlated with more glucose dissipating before entering the bloodstream.
After resistance training, insulin sensitivity remained elevated up to 48 hours post-session. There also was a major difference between resistance training and aerobic training in terms of its ability to affect insulin sensitivity. So, while aerobic training is vitally important for cardiovascular and respiratory function, along with the functioning of a number of metabolic pathways, the key to true metabolic health lies in resistance training.
In non-scientific terms, insulin keeps you from caramelizing your red blood cells, organs, nerves, and other vital tissues. Have you ever heated a pan, added onions, and then watched as the onions change color and generate a sweeter flavor? Well, that caramelization process is heat activating the release of sugar, which breaks down the structure of the molecules to make glucose more accessible. When you consistently run high blood glucose levels (diabetes) or have large spikes in blood glucose (insulin resistance), this process is basically taking place within your bloodstream and everything else within reach. This is the core reason why a sedentary lifestyle and hyper-nutrition create a whole host of other health issues.
So, in short, the more muscle on your body, the more carbs you can handle. Not a bad thing right? Get jacked. It’s good for your health and your performance.
The glycemic index has been used for quite some time now to “grade” and make recommendations on food quality, specifically carbohydrate sources. This should cease to exist…preferably yesterday, and for a multitude of reasons. First, again, nobody eats food in isolation. Even if you’re eating sugar in the form of a cookie, there are fats involved that will slow digestion and glycemic response. Enjoy that cookie with a glass of whole milk? Same story, which muddies the water further. Second, the utility of the glycemic index has been entirely debunked by numerous research studies:
“Low GI/GL diets do not lead to significantly more weight loss than higher GI/GL diets over the moderate term in overweight or obese people. To address the sources of uncertainty, there is a need for larger, longer, higher quality trials.” – Braunstein et. al.
“There is currently no evidence available regarding the effect of low GI diets on cardiovascular disease events. Moreover, there is currently no convincing evidence that low GI diets have a clear beneficial effect on blood lipids or blood pressure parameters.” – Clar et. al.
“We did not find any significant effect of dietary glycemic index or glycemic load on serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, including hs-CRP, leptin, IL-6, and TNF-α in adults.” – Milajerdi et. al.
If you go off any sort of glycemic index to judge the quality of the foods you’re eating, you can just go ahead and stop. It’s a terrible predictor of food quality.
So why go through all this just to debunk glycemic index? Well, because sugar shouldn’t be seen as the devil. In fact, it could be your best friend. If you’re an active college or professional athlete, how are you expected to eat enough calories during the day when you have 4 hour practices, plus weight training, potentially classes, and other life events that prohibit you from eating frequently and getting enough calories?
Additionally, if you’re trying to get enough calories in during the day using sweet potatoes as your carb source…well good luck with that. Sometimes you need to “dirty up the diet” to hit your caloric needs, whether that’s cereal, sandwiches, hell, even peanut butter Pop-Tarts if it calls for it. Just make sure your blood glucose doesn’t spike above 140 mg/dL after a meal.
So, how does one get an internal picture of how their body responds to meals? Well there’s a few options:
A glucometer is your standard finger prick test and is accessible over the counter and for relatively cheap; however, most people are not too keen on repeatedly jabbing their finger throughout the day. A glucometer is a seen as the gold standard because It measures the blood directly—measuring blood glucose more accurately.
Standard test with glucometer:
You should be able to return to your baseline within 2 hours of a meal, and sometimes within an hour. If not, you may want to speak to a primary care doctor.
Much more convenient to use, a CGM is a hardly noticeable device that sits on the back of your arm and is surprisingly painless. It measures the interstitial fluid, leaving about a 15 minute delay between readings and actual blood glucose levels. On top of that, you need a doctor’s prescription to get your hands on one. Each sensor lasts about 14 days, and can give you daily insights and trends throughout the day. However, because many athletes operate on similar routines, including their diet, it may be overkill and redundant to repeatedly use a CGM for more than a month.
Testing with a CGM is way easier than with a glucometer:
Now that you know how to measure your blood glucose, as well as the tools that are available to you, how do you know what you’re looking at?
Generally speaking, the general consensus is that “resting” blood glucose levels between 80-90 mg/dL are optimal for health and longevity. However, stress, food intake, and exercise can all affect these throughout the day, so there will be some natural variability. The Levels app makes it easy to understand. Their proprietary algorithm gives you a Daily Metabolic Score, as well as a Zone Review for each meal (as long as it’s tracked).
If you are tracking your glucose levels manually through a glucometer, you’ll want to keep total blood glucose excursions under 50 mg/dL from your baseline. So, if your baseline is at 90 mg/dL, following a meal you’ll want to keep your blood glucose levels at least below 140 mg/dL. If you’re using a CGM, since it measures interstitial fluid rather than the blood directly, it’ll be glucose excursions closer to 30 mg/dL from baseline.
That said, regardless of what device you’re using, don’t fall into the fragility mindset trap that anything over those guidelines is “bad” or “poor metabolic health”. A general rule of thumb is while you want to avoid high and low jumps in blood glucose, an excursion outside these ranges is not the end of the world. As long as you avoid large swings and stay within the 80-120 mg/dL range for most of the day, you’re likely in good metabolic health.
The human body is an amazing system with lots of backstops and processes built in to keep you in homeostatic balance, from insulin kicking in to help dissipate high blood sugars, to your liver kickstarting gluconeogenesis if you go hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) in order to have readily available energy.
Speaking of hypoglycemic, it’s important to mention that you may want to avoid low blood sugar as well as high blood sugar. There is some supportive evidence that shows that hypoglycemia is associated with cardiovascular complications. While you may not have low blood glucose levels so often, it is important to note that hypoglycemia could also be induced by the swings in your blood sugar. What matters more is the size of the swing, rather than the levels themselves. Sometimes bigger spikes can lead to lower lows, so it’s something to look out for and monitor. Subjectively, this can potentially be associated with that crash or lethargic feeling after a meal.
Tying this all in, Levels has built an app to help make tracking and awareness of metabolic health more accessible to the general public. Typically, a CGM is only available through a doctor’s prescription and only given to those with diabetes; however, Levels has gathered a network of independent doctors who, depending on your state, can write you a prescription after you fill out a short questionnaire. Currently, since Levels is still in beta-testing, you can sign up for the waitlist here.
Levels is a great tool for users of any background who are interested in optimizing health and performance.
For the Beginner:
For the Intermediate:
For the Advanced:
The app itself is extremely intuitive, making tracking and understanding your blood glucose swings easy, even for the absolute novice. With a score system between 1-100, the daily scores are extremely easy to understand. On top of that, each meal, when logged, can give you a metabolic score based on your blood sugar swings and the time it takes to return to baseline.
The morning after, you will receive a daily report emailed to you, breaking down your day’s performance and meal scores if you logged them, including your average glucose level, variability, and time in optimal range, among others. All this information can be found within the Levels app, but it is readily accessible through daily emailed reports.
If you’re a little more familiar with blood glucose, or have read this blog, then you can view your blood glucose within the Levels app and monitor it throughout the day, rather than relying solely on the metabolic scores.
So, where is the benefit of wearing a CGM and using the Levels app? Well, there is a lot of education built into the app itself. Articles are categorized from Athletic Performance, to Mood, Focus, and Energy. We at Driveline believe a more educated athlete is a better athlete, and clearly the team at Levels believes in the same. From educational reading resources to guided personal experimentation, the Levels app is like having your own personal nutrition coach at your fingertips.
As always, you get out what you put in. The resources exist within the app to give you the tools and information you need to get started, regardless of your goals or your current experience level.
From a research perspective, there is a massive value in having CGMs in the hands of larger populations, both metabolically fit and unfit. Most research in the blood glucose realm has been done on more diabetic or unfit populations. Having a larger dataset, paired with even just basic activity levels (Levels can connect with Apple Health and automatically log your workouts) and food logging, we can develop much greater insights on exercise, nutrition, and how our choices may affect long term health. The more data from more diverse populations, the deeper the insights we may be able to draw down the road—even if that means fewer “absolutes” when it comes to training, nutrition, etc.
Most of the current drawbacks with Levels are with the hardware itself. Usually it takes the CGM about 24 hours to calibrate, since it measures interstitial fluid, meaning you may get some inaccurate and more volatile readings in your first day or two with the sensor. Don’t check it too often at first. The same thing is true towards the end of the sensor’s lifespan. On about Day 13 or 14, a few users reported that the sensor tended to drop low and deliver glucose readings lower than normal, affecting scores in the Levels app. You’ll truly get about 11-12 high quality days of readings, but there are a few days in there that you may not draw significant insights from.
Getting started with Levels is $399, which gets you 2 Freestyle Libre sensors, access to the app, and a welcome kit to help you get started. This lasts you about 28 days, and you are then charged $199 per month for a monthly subscription. Most of these costs are currently to cover the hardware (CGM). Having a dietician or nutritionist typically runs you between $50-$100 per hour, so this is roughly priced in the same ballpark as a weekly meeting with a dietician. However, you will have access 24/7.
You can also pause and resume your subscription. So, if you find yourself in a good routine and don’t necessarily need a CGM, you can pause your subscription, then if you have a significant lifestyle change or just decide you want to switch things up, you can easily resume your subscription service and get yourself back on track.
Given Driveline’s core mission of finding more objective measures of performance and training, Levels’ new-to-market biometric tracking app can be the next step in measuring and planning for individual performance. Whether you’re a high-level athlete or a general fitness enthusiast, or just trying to lose weight and take control of your health and longevity, there is tremendous value in Levels.
Its objective measurements are useful, as are the built-in educational and coaching experience to lead you on a self-guided journey. Having accurate data about your metabolic health can also help dispel some sacred cows in the diet and “health” industry. For example, the belief that eating before bed is bad for you, that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, etc. It allows you to find out how your body actually responds to foods, timing, exercise, stress, and a large number of other factors.
Personally, I work out in the mornings and tend to eat a lighter breakfast, as I am more sensitive to glucose spikes earlier in the day. Later in the evening, when I am winding down after a long day, my body is parasympathetic and primed to digest and deal with meals, limiting my postprandial glucose excursions.
As we gather more nutrition data and pair it with performance data, we can gain further insights on how to properly fuel athletes for performance on an individual level. If you’re interested in getting set up with Levels, you can follow this partner link to skip their 100k+ person waitlist, sign up and take the next available slot.

Managing Stress and The Stress Mechanism - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-29T00:48:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/managing-stress-and-how-it-will-help-your-recovery/,"So far our recovery blog series has included articles on the basics of recovery, optimizing nutrition, and sleep environment and hygiene. Now we’ll dive into the mechanism of stress, the differences between acute and chronic stress and their impact on performance, and useful strategies to manage stress.
To understand stress management, you must first understand the mechanism of stress. To quote Dr. Andrew Huberman, “Stress is a generic system used to mobilize other systems in the brain and body to respond.”
Stress is simply a hormone-regulated physiological response to stressors (things that stress). This means that the general response to stressors does not differentiate between mental and physiological stress, a concept that is often misunderstood in the training process.
There is a difference, however, between acute (short term) and chronic (long term) stress.
Training is a carefully balanced system of stress and stressors. If you don’t acutely stress the system at all, there will be no adaptations. Stress the system too much without recovering, however, or undergo a massive acute stressor without having enough stress tolerance built up, and suffer the consequences.
Stress management can be as simple as this: Monitor acute stress and progress as needed to allow the system to tolerate more stress; regress as needed to allow the system to recover.
You can facilitate recovery from acute stress to prevent chronic stress and chronically high cortisol levels with simple strategies to encourage parasympathetic nervous system activation. You can’t control your physiology and your hormones, but you can control systems that massively affect them.
Firstly, the most effective tool to recover from stress is quality sleep. Sleep deprivation is correlated with elevated cortisol levels and a higher risk of injury. For more information on improving sleep, please refer to the sleep environment and hygiene blog.
Another applicable tool to downregulate the stress response is breathing. When breathing at rapid rates typically associated with stressors, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, but when breathing rates are slowed, there is more parasympathetic dominance.
One such strategy to slow breathing rates and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system is “The Physiological Sigh”—taking a large inhale through the nose, and then another large inhale through the nose before exhaling, followed by an extended exhale through the mouth, repeated several times. This strategy can increase oxygen levels in the blood and slow the heart rate, helping the parasympathetic nervous system take over.
Lastly, a key strategy for managing stress is establishing and connecting with a healthy social support network. Having healthy relationships with others in your life can help minimize stressors outside of training, as well as have very positive hormonal effects.
Having a social support system that you spend time with is strongly correlated with lowered cortisol and blood pressure, whereas having limited social contact with friends and loved ones is linked to higher cortisol levels, a lowered immune system, and increased rates of depression.
This is because spending time with people you have deeper, more positive connections with releases serotonin, a neuromodulator hormone that increases feelings of well-being and helps with sleeping and digestion (parasympathetic nervous system).
So, saying “I can’t hang out with my friends or family because I need to focus on my recovery” typically is not correct. As long as your relationships are healthy and don’t negatively impact your sleep or any other healthy habits, spending time with people you care about could be one of the most vital recovery modalities you have.

Optimizing Nutrition for Better Recovery and Performance - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-02T01:40:41+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/optimizing-nutrition-for-better-recovery-and-performance/,"In the first part of this blog series, we briefly touched upon the importance of nutrition to your recovery. In this blog, we are going to dive deeper and explain the basics of optimizing your nutrition to recover as quickly and completely as possible. If you haven’t already read the pilot article of this series, I recommend you check that out first.
When trying to make a change to your diet or eating habits, it’s important to remember that there is no single best diet or best food to be eating. As Stan Efferding famously states, “The best diet is the one you’ll stick to, the best exercise program is the one you’ll do. Compliance is the science.”
“Compliance is the science”. Whether you’re looking for a new diet or a new training program, it’s important to remember that the best plan is the one you’ll follow. pic.twitter.com/PodpHKzj3w
This quote has stuck with me ever since I first heard it when I was a freshman in college, trying to find the special diet that would get me jacked or make me throw harder. In reality, there is no magic diet or magic food, and results, especially with nutrition, will require consistency over time—which is why finding the diet that supports your goals and that you’ll stick to will benefit you the most.
In working order of nutritional importance, calorie balance comes first. Unless you have a rare underlying medical condition, your caloric balance will determine whether or not you gain, maintain, or lose weight. Below is the basic caloric balance needed to achieve the listed goals.
Gain weight: Calorie surplus
Maintain weight: Calorie maintenance
Lose weight: Calorie deficit
A calorie refers to a measurement of energy. Your body burns a certain amount of calories, or energy daily. The total amount of calories you burn each day is based on your total daily energy expenditure, or TDEE. Your TDEE is made up of the following; basal metabolic rate or how many calories you burn at rest, non-exercise activity thermogenesis (calories burned from walking, tapping, yard work, etc.), thermic effect of food (how many calories are burned from digesting food), and lastly exercise activity thermogenesis(the calories burned from exercise).
Improper caloric balance is typically the most common thing that prevents athletes from meeting their body weight goals. If you’re trying to gain weight but are not, for example, then you are very likely just not eating enough and so should eat more.
When determining how many calories you need to eat to reach your goals, there are a few different factors to account for. The first is calculating how many calories you need to maintain your current body weight.
This can be done in a variety of ways, such as using online calculators or, most commonly, tracking your food and bodyweight daily for 7 days and then reassessing. If your body weight has been roughly the same (+/- ~2lbs) for an extended period of time, you can assume that the average number of calories you’ve been eating is your maintenance level caloric intake.
After finding out your maintenance level caloric intake, the next factor to take into consideration is how quickly you want to reach your goals. If you have twenty weeks until your competition season starts and your goal is to gain 10lbs, that might dictate a much different path than if you had only five weeks to drop the weight.
Now that you have found your maintenance level caloric intake and have established your goals, we can move on to determining how many calories you should be eating to meet these goals. It takes a surplus of 3500 calories to gain one pound and a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.  Once you take that into consideration, the rest is fairly simple math.
If you want to gain one pound a week, you know you need to be in a 3,500 calorie surplus over the course of the week, or a 500 calorie surplus daily. If maintaining or improving body composition is a priority, then taking a slower route (~0.5lb/week, 250 calorie daily deficit) is probably preferable.
Before we dive into the specifics of protein, let’s first go over what protein is and what it does (the next sentence is a bit technical, but we’ll break it down further so stick with me).
Proteins are biochemical molecules consisting of polypeptides that are joined by peptide bonds between the amino and carboxyl groups of amino acid residues. Basically, you can think of protein as the main building block of your muscle and lean tissue. There are many different types of proteins throughout our body. They aid the body in many different functions such as digestion, muscle contraction, maintaining connective tissue structure, and hormone regulation. Due to their role in those functions, protein is very important for athletes.
Now that we have established what protein is and why it is important to our bodies, we can cover how much protein athletes need. You only need about 0.8g per kg of bodyweight per day to prevent a deficiency. Depending on numerous factors such as eating habits, body composition, goals and more, protein intake at 1.6-1.8g/kg of bodyweight should be sufficient for most athletes.
In a meta analysis from Morton, et al., they found that increasing protein intake much past 1.6 g/kg/day did not increase lean body mass. This does not mean that protein intakes exceeding 1.6g/kg/day are inherently bad; it just means that you can better allocate your calories elsewhere.
Protein is very satiating compared to carbohydrates, meaning that it leaves you feeling fuller, longer. This is important to note if you are a person who struggles with feeling full all the time when trying to gain weight, or feeling hungry all the time when trying to lose weight.
Raising or lowering your protein intake to match your goals and eating habits is your best bet to finding a sustainable and healthy diet.
Here is a list of quality sources of protein that you can add into your diet to help hit your daily protein goals.
After you have taken care of your calorie and protein needs, the next step is to monitor your intake of fat and carbohydrates. First, let’s focus on carbs and learn what they are and their role in the body.
Carbs are the sugars, starches, and fibers found in food. Carbs provide the body with glucose, which is stored in muscles as well as the liver and used for energy. Carbs are classified typically as either complex or simple. Generally speaking, simple carbs such as sugar are absorbed more quickly than complex carbs like those found in potatoes, which digest at a slower rate. Due to this, the timing of your carb intake can matter.
Typically, you should choose a simple carb option closer to competition or training and more complex carb options throughout the rest of your day. Carbs are an important energy source during exercise, especially during short, explosive movements such as swinging a baseball bat or throwing a pitch, due to the glycogen demands of explosive actions. The quantity of carbs consumed can be adjusted higher or lower just like protein, based on time of year, goals of the athlete, and eating history.
Fats play a critical role in the body. They assist brain function and regulating hormone activity. Your brain consists mostly of cholesterol and fat, so you can begin to see the importance of having adequate fat in your diet. When it comes to calories, fats contain 9 calories per gram, over twice as dense as protein or carbohydrates, which both contain 4 calories per gram. Due to this, fats are not as satiating as protein or carbs calorie for calorie.
For men, lack of fat intake reduces testosterone and other hormones that are critical for reproductive health. For women, inadequate fat intake can cause infertility and increase complications from PMS. The specific source of fat is also important for your health.
Generally, steer clear of vegetable oils and opt for healthier alternatives. Avocados, grass fed butter, animal fats, and extra virgin olive oil are great options for improved health and performance. A good rule of thumb is to try and get Omega 3 fats in a 2:1 ratio to Omega 6s.

Sleep Environment and Hygiene: A Deeper Dive - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-16T00:00:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/sleep-environment-and-hygiene-a-deeper-dive/,"Last time on our Basics of Recovery blog, we detailed the effects of sleep, nutrition, stress management, and active recovery on athletic performance. If you haven’t checked it out yet, it provides foundational information on the importance of sleep and lays the groundwork for this blog’s topic: sleep environment and hygiene.
Sleep environment is the physical space where sleeping occurs and sleep hygiene refers to sleep-centered habits that can improve sleep quantity, sleep quality, and latency (how long it takes to fall asleep). To improve sleep and enhance performance, it is essential to optimize both of these.
To get quality sleep, it is important to create a sleep environment conducive to recovery. First, the bedroom must be as dark as possible. Research suggests that light experienced even through closed eyelids can suppress the brain’s production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle known as the circadian rhythm. If possible, hanging blackout curtains over windows can greatly reduce ambient light in the sleeping environment. If hanging curtains is not possible, wearing a sleep mask is also a viable option.
It’s important to consider the temperature of the room for optimizing your sleep environment. It is recommended to keep the bedroom slightly cooler than room temperature, using bedding such as blankets to maintain body heat. If ideal is not possible, it is better to err on the cooler side, as higher temperatures cause increased wakefulness and decreased Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) cycle times. For more information on sleep cycles, check out this Sleep Foundation Article.
Another important aspect of a quality sleep environment is noise. Noise from roommates, outside transportation and other factors can significantly decrease the amount of REM and SWS sleep cycle times. Soundproofing your room or wearing a pair of comfortable earplugs to bed can help reduce the amount of ambient noise in your sleep environment and help you get more quality sleep.
Lastly, keeping your sleeping environment clean and fresh-smelling, especially when it comes to your bedding, can help prevent buildup of dust mites and other issues that may reduce air quality and prevent quality sleep. It is recommended to wash bedding such as pillowcases and sheets once per week.
Improving nutrition and substance intake before bed can also improve sleep quality. Limiting alcohol consumption both chronically and acutely is important for getting quality sleep and recovering from training.
A study on acute alcohol use and sleep using Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a commonly-used metric to measure the balance of the autonomic nervous system between sympathetic and parasympathetic states, found:
It has also been proven that alcohol consumption depresses both REM and SWS sleep cycle times, lowering overall sleep quality.
It is also important to limit the use of caffeine to at least 6 hours before bedtime, due to the well-researched sleep-disrupting effects of caffeine and other stimulants. As far as supplementing to improve sleep, supplementing with magnesium is a very well-researched method of improving sleep quality and duration, as well as increasing melatonin production. Many of the members of the Driveline High Performance staff supplement with magnesium nightly.
Lastly, improving your bedtime routine can also help optimize sleep. First and foremost, adhering to a sleep schedule can both increase sleep quality and reduce latency (how long it takes to fall asleep). Falling asleep and waking up at close to the same times every night will allow the circadian rhythm to efficiently regulate the sleep-wake cycle at the right times, allowing you to fall asleep faster and sleep better, as well as to wake up more refreshed. Additionally, refraining from activities such as watching television, scrolling through social media, playing video games and engaging with other media that will put you in a sympathetic nervous system state before bed is recommended.
Unfortunately, a significant percentage of the population uses media as a sleep aid, despite the fact that it is proven to lower quality of sleep. An easy way to reinforce this habit is to keep electronics out of the bedroom entirely, charging electronics in a separate room.
It is also important to limit exposure to blue light produced by screens in the hours before sleep. Studies show that two-hour exposures to blue light before bed suppress melatonin production in the brain. It is recommended to limit exposure to blue light at least three hours before bed. If using technology before bed is unavoidable, wearing blue light blocking glasses in the hours before bed is a very effective and affordable method.

The Basics of Recovery for Athletic Performance - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-25T01:06:13+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/the-basics-of-recovery-for-athletic-performance/,"When people think about what it takes to get bigger, stronger, or faster, they often only think about what happens in the weight room. In actuality, training in the gym breaks the body down, while the period of recovery afterwards is what builds the body back up.
You get bigger, stronger, and faster by recovering from that training. This process is called “supercompensation”. This can also be visualized in the image above.
When talking about recovery, it is important to note the role of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for increasing heart rate, blood flow and alertness. The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for reducing heart rate and digestion, and conserving energy.
Dr. Mike T. Nelson puts it well when he says to “think of [the] parasympathetic like your brakes and [the] sympathetic as your gas pedal.” Both parts of the autonomic nervous system play vital roles in an athlete’s performance. In this article we are going to focus primarily on activating the parasympathetic nervous system to allow for better recovery.
Quality and quantity of sleep are essential for athlete performance and recovery. Lack of sleep is shown to have negative effects on almost every area of performance, including reaction times, cognitive ability, and injury rates. Both acute and chronic sleep deprivation have large negative effects on performance. Acute sleep deprivation is getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep in a given night, and chronic sleep deprivation is not getting enough sleep for extended periods.
Every individual has different needs, but it is generally recommended to get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night to recover from the stresses of training. Making positive changes in sleep quantity and quality also has a strong correlation with increased testosterone and an improved immune system. In a study of 10 young men whose sleep was restricted from eight hours a night to five, daytime testosterone levels decreased by 10 to 15 percent.
Sleep hygiene refers to sleep-centered habits that can improve sleep quantity, sleep quality, and latency (how long it takes to fall asleep). The first recommendation for improving sleep hygiene is to create a quality sleep environment. In order to do this, make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. A popular way to ensure this is to hang blackout curtains and wear earplugs. Also, you might refrain from eating, relaxing, or studying in the bedroom, as it should be a place used exclusively for sleep.
The next recommendation for improving sleep hygiene is to go to sleep and wake up at similar times on a consistent basis. This is important because the human body has a circadian rhythm that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Adhering to a sleep schedule that allows your brain to release melatonin (the sleep hormone) at the same times every night will greatly improve sleep quality.
Another recommendation is to reduce blue light exposure in the hours before sleep. Blue light emitted by screens such as phones, computers, and televisions can impair the brain’s ability to produce melatonin. If using a screen before bedtime is unavoidable, purchasing an affordable pair of blue light reduction glasses and wearing them in the hours before bed is a viable option. The last simple recommendation to improve sleep quality is to limit caffeine and other stimulant consumption to early in the day, as the use of stimulants like caffeine close to bedtime can impair sleep.
Proper nutrition is also vital to an athlete’s recovery from training. It is important to ensure that you are eating enough calories to meet your bodyweight, body composition, and athletic goals, no matter the time of year.  We won’t dive into the nitty gritty of nutrition in this article, but we will go over some of the basics to make sure you are recovering the best way possible. A few of our strength coaches have found the Renaissance Periodization EBook useful as a more comprehensive guide to nutrition. You could also  check out Andy Galpin’s research on nutrition for athletes.
We commonly see athletes not eat the right amount of calories to meet their goals. This can go both ways, as both over- and under-eating are non-conducive to fitness and performance goals. There are a multitude of factors that go into the correct calorie balance for an individual, but in general if you want to lose weight you should be in a calorie deficit, and if you want to gain weight you should be in a calorie surplus.
When athletes ask how many calories they should be eating, we typically consider a few different factors. If they have already been tracking their calories using an app such as MyFitnessPal, then we can check their average caloric intake and add or subtract from there. If they haven’t been tracking their calories, we will typically have them download MyFitnessPal, and then we will tell them to eat normally and track everything they eat or drink for 4-5 days. From there, we will sit down with them again and see how many calories they’ve been averaging while eating like they normally do.
Unless altering body composition is the athlete’s main goal for the training block, most athletes typically need to primarily focus on calorie and protein intake. Depending on numerous factors such as eating habits, body composition, goals and more, protein intake at 1.6-1.8g/kg of bodyweight should be sufficient for most athletes.
When speaking of controlling stress in regards to training, most people exclusively think of the physical stress of the training itself. The truth is that physical, mental, and emotional stress all affect the body’s ability to recover and grow. The nervous system and endocrine system cannot tell the difference between physical, emotional, and mental stress.
An example of this would be a person feeling exhausted after a taxing emotional ordeal such as an argument with a partner. When exposed to stressors, the body transitions into a sympathetic nervous system state, also known as fight or flight. In this state, the hormones cortisol and adrenaline are increased. Short term, these effects are normal and healthy. However, being chronically stuck in a sympathetic nervous system state makes recovering from stress difficult.
One of the most important steps in managing stressors is to take an objective look at what in life is actually a stressor. Many people think they are “relaxing” when watching sports, watching television, or playing video games. The truth is their heart rate is likely elevated and they are in a sympathetic nervous system state—which means they are not recovering or relaxing during this time. This is not to say that activities outside of training that act as stressors must be completely removed, but it is important to be aware of them and to make an effort to limit their impact. Another important step to managing stress outside of training is learning stress management techniques to use in your daily life.
An established method of returning to a parasympathetic nervous system state is meditating or doing some form of breathwork. There are many techniques for meditation and breathing, and almost all of them are in some way effective at putting the nervous system in a state to recover. Additionally, learning conflict resolution techniques that allow for less unneeded stress in one’s daily life can massively reduce the amount of mental and emotional stress accumulated outside of training.
Baseball players have historically been told to do flush runs post throwing to remove the lactic acid from their arm. The soreness that many associate with lactic acid is the result of the massive stretch shortening cycle that the arm goes through in the delivery, along with the eccentric forces that throwing exerts on the body.
The goal for active recovery on recovery days should be to stimulate blood flow and restore range of motion. Great choices for active recovery on rest days can include anything that’s low stress and low impact. A few examples include movement circuits, walks, meditation, tempo runs and targeted soft tissue work. The main goal for these days is to avoid activities that will bring you back into a sympathetic state and inhibit your recovery.

Strategies for Optimizing Failure - Driveline Baseball,2021-02-27T01:00:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/02/strategies-for-optimizing-failure/,"Those of us living within the world of competitive sport have heard it all when it comes to failure. It’s unavoidable. It’s necessary for success. It should be looked at as “an opportunity for growth.” Failure holds a particularly central place in baseball.
Baseball—the only major sport that tracks “errors”. The only sport where failure at the plate is expected at least 70% of the time. Given that conventionally defined “failure” is inherent in baseball, devoting time to examining and enhancing our relationship with failure is more than beneficial; it is crucial for those of us determined to compete at the highest level.
Before we discuss the how of optimizing failure, let’s address the question posed by many of the athletes I work with: Can I outwork, outsmart, or otherwise avoid failure?
The allure of this avenue is clear: never having to deal with the feeling of letting people down, never having to admit you fell short. It’s enticing. So—is it possible? In a word: Yes. As you may expect, though, effectively engineering failure out of sport (and life) requires giving up a lot of other stuff, too.
The only way to be sure you never fail is to never put yourself in a position where failure is an option. Needless to say, this takes a lot of things off the table. Chief among them: high achievement. The pursuit of greatness requires a rigorous commitment to personal growth and improvement. The processes integral to continually rediscovering our “best”—developing novel skills, searching for more efficient ways of executing practiced skills, etc.—require training at the edge of our competency. In doing so, we leave ourselves vulnerable to failure. Indeed, the early stages of skill development result in failure about 50% of the time. Put simply: In order to achieve great feats in sport (and life), we must be willing to know great defeat.
I say this to make it clear that we all have a choice when it comes to the role failure plays in our lives. We can choose to avoid it (and deal with the repercussions), let it tear us down, or let it make us better. Making this choice is the first—and easiest—step.
Now that we agree that avoidance of failure is not an option for those of us committed to elite performance, we must do the work to transform our relationship with failure. One characteristic shared by performers considered “the best” is that they make failure work for them. Instead of regarding failure as a threat to be feared and wasting precious resources responding to it in an unproductive way, they have developed a relationship with failure that allows them to consistently view it as objective, constructive feedback; they have learned to optimize failure. In order for us to do the same, let’s investigate two key aspects of our relationship with failure: how we define failure, and the lens through which we process and respond to failure.
Before discussing how to most productively respond to failure, we need to decide what qualifies as a failure (a step often overlooked). A quick Google search yields many takes on what constitutes a failure, from lack of effort to a losing record. In baseball, conventional definitions of failure immediately come to mind: striking out, making an error, allowing a run, losing a game, etc.
It is less crucial to agree upon which definition is “right”, as each athlete will define failure differently, contingent upon their current goals, strengths, and weaknesses. What’s more important is to ensure that our definition of failure is workable; that it is constructed in a way that maximizes its ability to achieve its objective (providing constructive, applicable feedback).
The primary barrier athletes encounter, here, stems from having defined failure in a way that produces feedback that isn’t actionable. Often, this is because their failure framework is too rigid and absolute or is contingent upon aspects of performance that are partially or entirely beyond their control. Let’s consider a reliever whose definition of failure is coughing up the lead and taking an “L”. This framework—though common—isn’t particularly workable.
In this circumstance, the feedback the reliever walks away with is the knowledge that they gave up the lead and lost the game. Not only is this frustrating, but it also isn’t all that useful for the athlete; he hasn’t received any detailed feedback about how or why things fell apart (did he get too deep in the count? Lose focus on the mound? Have poor pitch selection?). Upon returning to training, the athlete lacks information on what specific aspect of his play he needs to improve to lessen the likelihood of a repeat “failure”. The result? Inefficient and emotionally draining training sessions.
Another weak point of this definition is that it is dependent on factors beyond the athlete’s control. While the “L” is in part the fault of the reliever, there could be other aspects at play (fielding errors, missed calls, mental mistakes, etc.). If failure feedback pertains to something beyond an athlete’s control, it is in no way actionable. Some may consider this an attempt to shift blame or evade accountability. In truth, it is objective fact—some “failures” are attributable to events entirely beyond our sphere of influence. It is extremely unproductive to internalize such instances as a personal failure; in doing so, we risk losing valuable training time and energy attempting to influence or improve that which we cannot change.
If our objective is to utilize failure as specific, constructive feedback that informs training and improves performance, we must be willing to reexamine and rework how we define failure. Ironically, I have found that it is only by encouraging athletes to introduce flexibility into their definitions of failure (and success) that they perform their best in the rather cut and dry game of baseball.
To ensure we respond to failure (whatever our definition) optimally, we must also commit to processing failure through a certain lens.
Let’s first consider how many of us—explicitly or not—have been told we should respond to failure. When we fail, the expected response is one of self-criticism, self-blame, and rumination. Many of us believe that relating to ourselves and our failures in this way is necessary for success in elite sport. What’s more, many athletes fear that, by making their definition of failure more workable and responding to failure with less self-criticism, judgment, and rumination, they will become complacent. They worry that, by transforming their relationship with failure, they will be perceived as weak, their performance standards will drop, and their motivation will plummet.
Interestingly, research suggests that these “traditional” responses to failure can actually be counterproductive.a Responding to failure in this harsh manner undermines self-regulation, emotional recovery, and stress management. Such reactions feed into avoidance and fear of failure and are costly to our mental and physical health. Notably, rumination and self-criticism activate the body’s stress response, which inhibits coordination, decision making, response time, and automatic skill execution. This means that responding to failure amidst a game with criticism and judgment has a direct, negative impact on our body’s physical performance on the diamond.
What can we do, then, to respond to failure in a way that is more conducive to high level performance? Research indicates that athletes who consistently respond to failure most effectively are those who have a growth mindset,bc are task-oriented,b and practice self-compassion.a
When it comes to how productively we cope with failure, research points toward one particularly salient factor: our mindset.bc
Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that we are born with a finite and static amount of basic qualities (intelligence, sport talent, social skills, etc.), and that these fixed traits are responsible for our successes. Because of this, they interpret failure as a reflection of their innate personhood—something that no amount of effort can change. They grow to avoid challenges, give up easily, and feel threatened by others’ success. Due to a fear of failure, they plateau early, and achieve less than their full potential.
Alternatively, individuals with a growth mindset believe that skills can be cultivated through intentional effort. They consider failure essential to the learning process, embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and are motivated by the success of others.
A growth mindset goes hand-in-hand with a task-centered goal orientation. Task-oriented athletes are focused on improvement and fueled by a desire to learn. As compared to ego-oriented athletes, whose focus is on demonstrating their superiority over others (common in individuals with fixed mindsets), task-oriented athletes respond to failure more constructively and experience optimized motivation, enhanced satisfaction and enjoyment, better peer relationships, and less burnout.c
Conveniently, simply having the awareness that these two mindsets and goal orientations exist increases our likelihood to adhere to a challenge-based, task-oriented, growth mindset. Recognizing our fixed, fear-based thoughts and actively making the choice to instead engage with productive, growth-oriented thoughts can be further enhanced through mindfulness practice.
It is incredibly difficult to fully adopt a healthy relationship with failure without practicing self-compassion. At the end of the day, we are human beings. All of us are fallible. Being able to regard ourselves—as performers and people—with compassion is one of the most difficult and most important skills we can develop.
Practicing self-compassion means committing to self-kindness versus self-judgment, mindfulness versus overidentification (recognizing that failing does not equate to being a failure), and common humanity versus isolation (viewing failure as a shared human experience as opposed to an individual one).
While practicing self-compassion strikes some as “soft”, the research backing its efficacy within and beyond sport is extensive.a To highlight a few findings, practicing self-compassion is positively related to an athlete’s psychological well-being, perseverance, favorable performance evaluations, and adaptive physiological responses to failure, and negatively associated with fear of failure, anxiety, shame, and passivity.a
Soft or not, the science is clear: Practicing self-compassion puts our minds and bodies in the position to perform at our best. If you’re looking to cultivate greater self-compassion, consider starting with practicing compassion for others and engaging in compassion/kindness meditation.
By transforming our relationship with failure and committing to letting our newfound perspective inform our actions (and reactions) in training and competition, we maximize our likelihood of consistently delivering top-tier performances.
Those of us who do the work—and genuinely believe in the work—will become more flexible, adaptable, resilient, engaged, and healthier performers; characteristics that can make all the difference when striving to compete at the highest level.

Why We Are Changing Our Recovery Protocols - Driveline Baseball,2020-10-16T04:33:57+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/10/why-we-are-changing-our-recovery-protocols/,"As Driveline Baseball has grown and become an ever-increasing presence in the game, our protocols have become common on the diamond and in training facilities throughout the country. One of Driveline’s more notable offerings has been our traditional recovery protocol.
An athlete will finish their throwing and immediately head into rebounders, waiter walks, band, and shoulder tube work. Our recovery protocol started developing years ago when our strength and conditioning program consisted of deadlifts, front squats, bench press, and some accessory work—vastly different from what our lifting program has evolved into today.
Even back then, however, we already knew that it was important to include shoulder complex work to strengthen the arm and “undo” the harmful effects of throwing. At the time, we assumed that the most efficient way of doing that work was to include it immediately after a throwing session. This is how our standard recovery protocol came about.
As years have gone by, more research has suggested that post-exercise recovery work may not have the effect on muscle soreness, range of motion, or next-day performance that we had previously believed it did. Furthermore, it has been shown that traditional arm care work, consisting of scapula and rotator cuff exercises, is better served when performed with a higher intensity and lower volume, to better match the demands of pitching.
Our traditional recovery protocol has consisted more of low intensity, high volume endurance type work. When you consider that throwing itself, especially on moderate to high-intensity days, is a fatiguing exercise, it doesn’t seem wise to have athletes perform more endurance work immediately after. Intuition aside, the research had added up to the point where it was clear that to best serve our athletes for their performance and their health, we needed to make a change.
Taking this into consideration, we identified some issues we needed to resolve:
We have decided to implement a full-body cool-down circuit, consisting primarily of dynamic movement with an emphasis on mobility, to allow athletes to dial in to how their bodies are feeling—while also identifying any particular areas that may need more work.
Additionally, we have moved our “arm care” work into our athletes’ lifting programs, which will allow them to be programmed in a higher intensity, lower volume manner. This allows us to:
To be clear, we will keep our traditional recovery protocol, and only have athletes perform it on their lower intensity, lower volume throwing days. Our revamped protocol will be in place after days when athletes throw at moderate to high intensities, and/or moderate to high volumes. We still find value in our traditional recovery protocol and feel that work to the shoulder complex on lighter days remains important—we just do not believe they should be performed at the frequency we have been prescribing them in the past.
This is an evolution we have had in the works for some time. Using sound logic and reasoning, we believe that this protocol will continue to allow our athletes to make the best progress possible while also keeping them at their healthiest.
Athletes who have trained with us previously are free to use the same post throwing protocols we have used in the past. For new athletes, we are moving their post throwing work to be more mobility focused. At Driveline, pitchers will throw before they lift so all of this work will take place right before our pitchers lift. As we experiment with different options we will be able to see how our athletes react and adjust our programs accordingly.

How Proper Breathing Can Boost Athletic Performance - Driveline Baseball,2020-09-10T04:00:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/09/how-proper-breathing-can-boost-athletic-performance/,"The importance of breathing has gained traction over the last several years as it pertains to the health and performance of not just baseball players—but all athletes. It’s safe to say that a large percentage of the baseball world has done some type of breathing drill during their career, whether incorporated into a warm-up, workout, or rehabilitation protocol.
While some players may understand why they were prescribed the drills, the full benefits of breathwork are largely unknown to the playing population. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the wide array of advantages breathwork can have for an athlete and to discuss ways to incorporate them into your routine.
There are many ways that breathing can have a positive impact on an athlete’s health and performance—too many, honestly, to cover in this article alone. However, some of the more important effects include:
Disclaimer — Breathing is not going to be an easy fix for your performance needs if you have other, lower hanging fruit. If you weigh 150 pounds, focusing on your breathing technique isn’t going to allow you to hit the ball over the fence. If you’re drinking a 6-pack a night, you’re not going to recover from intense workouts better because your diaphragm is working right.
Generally, when I prescribe breathing exercises for an athlete, my primary goal is to affect a musculoskeletal change, whether that be improved mobility in an area or better trunk stability. There are several mechanisms by which this can occur. Let’s first look into what happens at the spine and rib cage.
Our primary muscle of inspiration is the diaphragm, a muscle that attaches to the bottom six ribs, the sternum, and the top three lumbar vertebrae. On average, we take over 20,000 breaths a day. In an ideal world, when we inhale, the diaphragm descends and flattens out, and the ventral cavity (rib cage/thoracic spine, abdominal cavity, and pelvis) expands in all directions. As we exhale, the diaphragm ascends and takes on a dome-like shape, and the ventral cavity compresses (If you would like a visual of this, here is a good example).
Throughout life, we can develop compensatory strategies that essentially reduce the amount of movement the diaphragm and rib cage go through during a breath cycle. The ventral cavity can stay compressed when it needs to expand and vice versa. When this happens, mobility can be reduced in various areas of the spine and rib cage. In these instances, an athlete can do all the thoracic mobility work they want, but will either:
While this may appear to be a good demonstration of whole-spine flexibility, most of her motion is coming from her lumbar spine.
Restoration of proper mechanics of the diaphragm and thorax can frequently allow an athlete to make the mobility gains they are seeking, or at the very least, provide an opportunity for their mobility exercises to be more effective. This effect can also play a role throughout the hips.
During the breath cycle, the thorax’s inability to have a full range of motion also impacts the pelvis. Very often, this will cause the pelvis to be oriented anteriorly (the notorious anterior pelvic tilt!). While this orientation is not bad as your standard healthcare provider may make it out to be, it still can be an underlying cause of decreased hip mobility. With the pelvis tilted forward, the area where it meets the femur to create the hip joint also changes position. However, since your legs are often connected to the ground, the femur stays in a relatively constant position.
This moves the hip joint closer towards an end-range of motion, which reduces the amount of motion it is capable of to certain ranges. The analogy that I’ve used (credit to either Mike Cantrell or James Anderson) is that your hip is an elevator that wants to go up ten stories in a ten-story building—but you are already on floor seven. Again, if we can restore proper diaphragm and thorax movement capabilities, this can allow the pelvis to move into positions where more hip range of motion becomes possible (i.e. bring the body back down to floor zero).
In addition to better spine mobility, improving breathing mechanics can improve stability throughout the lumbar spine and pelvis as well. There are a few thoughts as to how this can happen. Primarily, however, let’s take a look at how breathing can have an impact on posture.
The picture on the left shows a person who is likely in a compressed posterior rib cage, diaphragm descended, pelvis anterior oriented state. From this position, many of the muscles that attach to the spine and pelvis, namely obliques and transverse abdominis, are going to be in a more eccentric, or lengthened state.
These muscles, along with others, provide a significant amount of control to the pelvis, rib cage, and lumbar spine. In this lengthened position, they are at a mechanical disadvantage in producing force and providing support to the structures they attach to. While the goal is not to “change” someone’s posture and make them more like the picture on the right, restoring breathing mechanics can allow those muscles to improve tension to better support the ribs, pelvis, and lumbar spine.
Now that we’ve discussed the musculoskeletal effects of improving breathing mechanics, let’s take a look into what it can do for an athlete from a systemic perspective. It is well known that there are fluctuations in the autonomic nervous system that correspond to athletic activities. Our normal resting state is driven by the parasympathetic nervous system, where we are more relaxed, and our normal body systems, such as digestion, are able to function.
On the other end of the spectrum, during competition we are more driven by our sympathetic nervous system—our heart rate increases, blood rushes to our muscles, and we get into more of a “fight or flight” state. Being in a sympathetic state in competition is a good thing as it can enhance performance. However, being in that state for too long, too often, or being unable to come out of it can become problematic, as it is more taxing on the body and can hinder its ability to recover from competition.
This is where heart rate variability (HRV) comes into play. In a nutshell, HRV is how well our heart is able to handle fluctuations in its rate and, therefore, also handle stress. Athletes with low HRV will become more taxed by being in a sympathetic state, and potentially have difficulty returning to a parasympathetic state. Athletes with a high level of HRV will be able to handle that competitive state better and will be able to recover from hard competition or training more readily than someone with low HRV.
There are many ways to improve HRV in an athlete, but one of the easiest is to improve the athlete’s breathing capabilities. The autonomic nervous system and HRV are heavily regulated by the vagus nerve. Studies have shown that performing slow nasal breathing (around 6 breaths/minute) can improve vagus nerve activity, which in turn improves parasympathetic drive and heart rate variability.
If you scour the internet for breathing techniques, you will find differing thoughts and ideologies as to the “correct” way to breathe. Mainly, there is debate on whether a person should fill the chest with air or focus on “belly-breathing”. I find myself falling into the camp of focusing more on getting air into the upper rib cage, with the following caveats:
My opinion is that a properly performed respiratory cycle with the intention of improving movement capabilities should be performed with a complete, full exhale. This will naturally create tension throughout the obliques and transverse abdominis that should be maintained to essentially give the diaphragm a better ability to drive airflow into the upper rib cage, which will allow for improved thoracic mobility. The video below should provide a good demonstration of this.
It has been my experience that a focus on belly breathing does not adequately allow the upper rib cage to expand, and, additionally, makes it more difficult to keep the abdominal musculature in a position to best control the pelvis, spine, and ribcage. I also hold the opinion that air should primarily go where your lungs are, which the last I checked, is not your stomach.
Lower ribcage and trunk expansion with upper ribcage compression. Potentially a belly-breathing effect.
With that said, there are plenty of providers and coaches that have had success coaching a belly-breathing technique, and at the end of the day I think the MOST important thing that needs to be taught is that breathing should be slow and inhalation should occur through the nose.
Generally, I have my athletes perform 1-2 exercises in certain positions as part of their warm-up to achieve whatever movement effect I am trying to create. I then have them do one of the exercises as a cool down, primarily for the purpose of getting them out of the sympathetic state that training can drive, and bring them into recovery mode.
One thing that has left a bad taste in the mouths of those who’ve tried these kinds of breathing exercises has been the use of balloons. Mostly used under the Postural Restoration Institute umbrella, a balloon can be used to provide a bit of resistance for the obliques and transverse abdominis to work against, eliciting a better stabilization effect on those muscles.
However, it has been my experience that for the majority of athletes a focus on a full exhale, followed by a 4-5 second pause, and then maintaining tension during the inhale should be enough to get the effect you are going for. So you can hold off on the balloons.
By this point, the importance of incorporating some type of breathing drill into your routine should be more apparent. A significant degree of experience or knowledge is not required to incorporate exercise that will yield results. Taking a short period of time to utilize this technique can have great results on an athlete’s health and performance.

The impact of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) on baseball players,2020-03-22T04:30:20+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/03/the-impact-of-the-autonomic-nervous-system-on-baseball-players/,"At some point in their careers, many baseball players have to spend time under the care of a medical provider.
What we tell athletes under that care can have long term psychological effects that present themselves in physical manifestations.
Traditionally, the standard of care has been to identify areas on the body that are not moving optimally, assign blame to those areas as the reason an athlete got hurt, and then “fix” those areas.
In a short-sighted way, this makes perfect sense, and this model has helped many athletes.
However, the psychological impact this can have on a person is often ignored—and it is an impact that is often more severe for an athlete trying to allow their body to perform at peak levels.
I recently worked with an athlete who had been to physical therapy on and off for the last several years with multiple lumbar stress fractures. He was always diligent about completing his home exercise program and listened to his doctor’s instructions.
For much of his high school life, this athlete was told that he kept getting injured because of weakness in his core and hips, along with having poor thoracic flexibility. His fracture has now been healed for some time, yet he is still having pain with baseball activities.
During his exam, he demonstrated good mobility with some remaining weaknesses. When he discussed what he is doing at home, he explained the exercises doctors gave him in the past.
I asked him how often he is thinking about protecting his spine. He replied, “Pretty much all the time”.
At that point, I talked to him about how his fracture had healed and explained that any future core strengthening should come from his strength program.
We began weaning him off the exercises that were part of his normal “spine care” routine, and after a few visits his strength was back to normal and his pain was significantly reduced.
Injuries are much more complex than “this body part is inefficient, therefore this other area suffers”.
Recent workload, fitness level, nutrition, amount of sleep, mental stress, environmental changes, and many, many other factors can all play a huge role in the breakdown of tissue.
Those factors aside, what can often get overlooked is the very real part that mental and emotional stress can play in an athlete’s well-being.
Stress is how your body responds to events in your life.
Relationships, school, work, and training are all examples of stressors. Your experiences and how you handle these stressors can move your body into a sympathetic (fight or flight) or parasympathetic (relax and recover) state.
Ideally, your body maintains a nice flow and balance between these two states.
When the time comes to train and perform, you want your sympathetic nervous system to be more active. When training or a game is finished, it’s time to move into a more parasympathetic state for recovery.
Spending too much time on one end of the spectrum can impact performance and health in a negative manner. They can make activities more taxing on the body than normal, especially if one becomes more sympathetically dominant.
An example of this would be an athlete being sorer from a 40-pitch bullpen during a week where they had three exams as opposed to a week where they had no tests.
The stress of the bullpen didn’t change, but they’re more likely in a sympathetic state due to the stress of the exams.
As previously stated, certain stressors can move your body into a more sympathetic or parasympathetic state.
Let’s take another example of a pitcher I saw recently with a shoulder injury he sustained during the season. Initially, he had some tightness in the back of his shoulder that he was ignoring.
He continued to pitch through it, increasing tightness and fatigue and eventually sustained an injury. His shoulder has since healed and he has returned to his normal throwing routine.
But now he is nervous about feeling any tightness in the back of his shoulder. His body is more alert to that sensation than it was previously.
The tightness itself, which can be a normal consequence of throwing, is now a stressor that can move him towards a more sympathetic state.
This could be both a benefit and a detriment to the athlete. It can potentially alert him to fatigue and that he may need to cut back his throwing routine.
Or, he could take any tightness as a sign of potential injury, immediately shut down, and be unable to make any significant progress with training due to constant fear of re-injury.
An athlete’s experiences with medical providers can also lead to long-term stressors which can become detrimental. During recovery, he went to the doctor who diagnosed him with GIRD (a loss of shoulder internal rotation) as a major contributor to his injury.
He went to physical therapy, where they told him his injury was a result of weakness in his scapular muscles and tightness in his hips. Using our current example, just from this one injury experience the athlete now has the following negative thoughts associated with throwing:
None of these statements are definitively true, however.
There are plenty of athletes with inflexible hips and shoulders who feel tightness during throwing but can still pitch at an extremely high level without ever suffering an injury. Does it mean this athlete doesn’t need to focus on those areas with his training ever? Of course not.
But he also doesn’t need to spend a half-hour every day focusing on corrective exercise for these areas. High-level athletic performance requires an athlete to have a great deal of trust in their body.
With every flaw an athlete possesses pointed out to them on a treatment table, it not only reduces the trust they have in themselves but it can also create a chronic stressor. This may drive them further towards the sympathetic end of the spectrum, reducing their capacity to adapt to other stressors that are already present in baseball and life.
So, what can we do to ensure that athletes are still receiving high-quality care while not developing a fragility mindset?
Unfortunately, I don’t believe there is an easy answer to this question.
I do believe the answer starts with understanding that a great many factors go into an injury or decreased performance. While movement deficiencies do play a role, they likely don’t contribute more than workload, throwing fitness, recovery and so on.
Many times I have suggested the idea of taking “inventory” of what is going on in their lives. This can be an end of training reflection, journaling exercise, or some other practice. This can help identify any additional things in their lives that could be impacting their training.
Over the past week, maybe their arm has not been feeling great. But as they look back, they realize they are having trouble with a close friend. Or maybe they haven’t made any velocity gains, but they also haven’t been sleeping well because they are keeping themselves up at night worrying about it.
Giving themselves an awareness of stressors can have a benefit in keeping an athlete from being too sympathetically dominant.
Athletes, coaches, parents and health care providers should be educated about this process. They should also be educated on how adaptable the human body truly is. Even in the absence of “optimal movement”, our bodies adjust to stresses placed on it and become more resilient overall.
Focusing on building that resilience should be just as—if not more—important than trying to fix areas that are inefficient. Giving athletes that knowledge and the feeling of being a strong, adaptable human can become a huge asset for them in their goal of being a healthy, high-level athlete.
