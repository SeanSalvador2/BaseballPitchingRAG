Off-Season Speed Training for Position Players - Part 1 - Driveline Baseball,2025-02-27T04:01:46+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2025/02/off-season-speed-training-for-position-players-part-1/,"Welcome to the first installment of our four-part series on off-season speed training for Minor League Baseball (MiLB) position players. In this series, we’ll detail the speed training system we implemented this off-season and explain how you can adapt it to your own program.
The off-season for a baseball player should have multiple priorities that all reflect the end goal of getting the athlete prepared for his upcoming season. In this series, we are going to examine a very important component that should be found in every healthy player’s training: speed work.
(Note: For the sake of this series, we are referring to healthy position players—injured players or those on a return-to-play protocol should consult with their respective medical and performance specialists.)
We should always aim to make our athletes faster—or at the very least, keep them from losing speed in the off-season. Introducing sprints and other forms of high-intensity running early on helps ensure they don’t fall behind.
Speed training yields a host of positive adaptations that carry over into other facets of performance, including:
These qualities are crucial for sports where the ability to generate force quickly is a key indicator of success.
Sprinting is a frequent activity in both games and practices. If the body isn’t properly conditioned, the likelihood of hamstring strains, shin splints, and other injuries increases. While there’s no way to guarantee injury prevention, you can substantially lower the odds by preparing muscles, joints, and connective tissues for the loads they’ll face.
Once an athlete has taken some time off after his season concludes and is ready to start his off-season training program, speed training can be introduced right away.
So, what’s an effective way to go about implementing an off-season speed training plan? Here’s how we did it:
Athletes at Driveline lift three times per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. In accordance with the high-low model of stress tolerance, we lined up the speed training to fall on those days as well, so that Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays can be lighter days where their focus is on skill work.
For our hitters (who are in the cages six days per week), this meant speed training would fall on bat speed training days. They typically reported feeling like they were able to rotate faster, compared with hitting after a briefer and more minimal warm up, and liked how primed and ready they felt getting into the cages after speed training.
Our pro speed group started mid-morning with a full dynamic warm up and a session that lasted 30-45 minutes. The guys would then have about 20 minutes afterward to switch gears and get ready for their hitting groups. Lifting and throwing (plus a break for food) would follow hitting.
The schedule for how we set up the week was as follows:
The dynamic warm up took about 15 minutes and was very similar on each of the three days, with a couple small variances depending on the focus of the session (we will explain this more in-depth during the upcoming sections).
We’d start with some ground-based mobility and then progress to in-place standing movements mixed in with a variety of locomotive drills. Build-up sprints of increasing intensity and varied starting positions were sprinkled throughout the warmup, starting at around 60% effort and ending around 95%.
After the dynamic warm up, we would incorporate jumping exercises that correlated with the primary focus of that particular speed work session and then get to work!
In Part Two, we’ll take an in-depth look at acceleration training: the drills we use, the coaching cues we emphasize, and the how’s and why’s of our progression systems.

The Benefits of Simplicity in Youth Hitting Training - Driveline Baseball,2022-10-31T16:53:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/10/simplicity-in-youth-hitting-training/,"I heard this great quote the other day:Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
At Driveline Baseball we’re obviously known to be data-driven, and while that is true (and won’t change), we don’t want our training environments for young players to be needlessly complicated – by data, or anything else that doesn’t serve our ultimate goal of skill development. To that end, one of the easiest ways to apply this idea of “sophisticated simplicity” is to use Hitting Plyos – specifically the Mini Hitting Plyos – when training young hitters.
While we’ve discussed the benefits of Hitting Plyos before, it’s worth discussing in more detail the simplicity that they bring to training, and the specific benefit of that simplicity for younger players to have their hitting mechanics shaped by the quality of the batted balls they produce.
We can (and do) argue about the mechanics of hitting all day long. We’ve been doing it online since the dawn of the internet, and for decades prior to that in countless books on baseball training. Whether it’s advocating for players to have a rear-legged swing, a front-legged swing (Charlie Lau anyone?), no-legged (yes I’ve seen this too), linear movements, or rotational movements…our industry has been barking into an echo chamber about these ideas seemingly forever.
As parents and coaches – and parents who coach – this allure of “correct mechanics” for youth players is incredibly powerful due to our level of love, care, and investment in our athletes. When working with young athletes there is also often the sense that because we’re working with kids – who can be a proverbial blank slate – we can “install” these mechanics the same way we might install a part on our car.
The first problem that arises with this approach is whether the physical mechanics we’re attempting to install are a correct fit for the physical capability of a youth athlete at their current state of biological development and whether they are physically capable of getting into the positions we think correspond to our so-called “correct” mechanics. Given that most of the time we’re looking to professional athletes for inspiration on our ideal swing mechanics, and because those professional athletes are physically mature adults, a mechanics-first approach for children inspired by the movements of adults is very likely to be ill suited for children because of substantial physical discrepancies between the two groups.
Beyond that issue, most of the time that the way this mechanics first approach is “installed” has youth players focusing more on the way that their bodies are moving and much less on the batted ball results that they are creating. This is incredibly problematic because of how it can negatively affect the perceptual task of hitting – deciding when and where to swing – and how it places the batted ball result of the swing secondary to the mechanics of the swing.
The simple reality is that good hitting is:
with the ideal result being a hard-hit ball. If we want to build a pyramid of ideal swing production, the base of that pyramid is being on time. And if we know that every on-time swing starts with an on-time swing decision, we need to equip players with the type of cognitive clarity that allows for that swing decision to happen on time and be immediately translated into action. Having players focus on the intention of their swings, not their mechanics, and deploying that intention on time helps players by putting the first thing first: Be on time.
As the old saying goes there are “many roads to Rome”. The point of that expression here is that getting to your destination – in our case being on time with the bat relative to each individual pitch, and creating flush contact between bat and ball – matters more than how you actually get there. If the internal cueing typically used when swing mechanics are put above swing results comes with some significant net negatives for perception and motor output with older athletes, it’s not unreasonable to expect that youth athletes would suffer these flaws more significantly due to their already biologically limited motor control and proprioceptive development.
Additionally, when it comes to players subconsciously limiting motor output in order to move “correctly”, getting good at moving slow is not a Skill That Scales, so we should be very sensitive to any cues or coaching that pushes players toward this point.
A more ideal training environment for young players has them focusing on a specific intention as the result of their swings, and then using batted ball feedback to confirm whether they generated what they intended. If so – great! If not, then it’s time to re-assert the same intention and try again. We can train with this kind of specific intention and get immediate feedback on our swing results by using Mini Hitting Plyos.
The most significant benefit of using Mini Hitting Plyos is the fidelity of feedback between the swing intention and swing result. The player has a clear objective of what each swing should produce, and using the Mini Hitting Plyos makes that feedback on whether they achieved the objective or not immediately apparent.
The ideal outcome for each swing with Mini Hitting Plyos is incredibly simple:
When a player’s bat makes contact with the Mini Hitting Plyo one of two things will happen.
The benefit of this feedback simplicity is that it distills the goal and result of each swing down to the most simple and easy to understand level for the athlete. If flush contact is our first objective, then we’re going to have to have our bat both on time and on-plane with the incoming pitch to generate it.
Our second objective is to hit the Mini Hitting Plyo hard because doing this not only necessitates flush bat-to-ball contact but also necessitates bat speed. When it comes to Skills That Scale in hitting for youth players, there is nothing more important than developing bat speed. While bat speed makes the balls we hit with flush contact productive, it also increases the possibility that the balls we don’t make flush contact with are more productive than they otherwise would be.To briefly unpack this idea, as much as we’d like it not to be true, players will often make non-ideal contact in competition. The difference between an easy to field ground ball and a ball that squeaks through the infield, or an infield pop-up versus a flare that gets over the infielders’ heads is in the amount of retained bat speed that gets imparted to the ball.
The benefit of training bat speed and raising its peak value is that by doing so we’re also raising the bat speed applied during non-ideal contact situations or when players are fooled and have to get off something other than their “A swing”.
Hitting the ball hard is good, bat speed and flush contact are necessary ingredients to achieve that outcome, and don’t let anyone tell you different.
Robbie “Byrd” Tenerowicz showing that good things happen when you move the bat fast and hit the ball flush
Because young players are still learning how to link movement solutions (their swings) to perceptual tasks (their swing decisions) and we do not want to pattern a contact first swing that lacks output, it’s best to start using the Mini Hitting Plyos in relatively easy training environments like tee work or side soft toss so that players can pattern a swing where flush contact AND bat speed are rewarded. Then, as their success rate goes up, we can progressively scale up the difficulty of the environment to firm front flips or even live arm as needed.
Playing simple games with clear objectives is the best way to get players started using Mini Hitting Plyos, and having players achieve these ideal objectives and be rewarded with points is the best way to engage and encourage them.
An example of this for a young player starting with Mini Hitting Plyos would be to take 8 swings and have a simple goal of hitting 4 of the 8 balls flush. Depending on the age, skill, and experience of the player you may want to have them start with the ball on a Tee, but I would generally recommend starting with the least challenging training environment where the ball is still moving because we can then engage players in the development of their swing AND deploying that swing based on their perception of where and when the ball is going to be.
You can then scale the difficulty of your training games up either a modification to the training environment, the difficulty of the training environment, or some combination of both, depending on the capability and performance of the player.
No matter the configuration in order to keep player engagement level high it’s important to maintain our commitment to the clear objective of the task (hit the Mini Hitting Plyo flush and far) in whatever training environment we construct. And as tantalizing as it is to correct whatever swing flaws you may detect along the way, when it comes to young kids who are constantly growing you’re helping them – not hurting them – by putting their swing result first, so long as the swing results are oriented around our ideal batted ball outcome goals.
If we’re training hitters, specifically young ones who are constantly learning & relearning how to use their bodies, we should generally pay more attention to their batted ball production than their mechanics. Young players who are constantly navigating around their own rapidly changing bodies can very easily get wrapped up on their own in this search for “correct” mechanics, even without the suggestion of what those “correct” mechanics are by well-intended coaches or parents. It’s a problem that can end up as a directionless Journey to Nowhere when that search does not address the fundamental outcome we want for each swing, regardless of the:
We should train youth players to always hit the ball flush, hard, and ideally far. This is the ultimate objective for every swing, because it’s the most productive outcome we can generate in the game itself. And training productive batted ball outcomes plays, whether you’re in a facility or on the field.
Keep it sophisticatedly simple 😉

Upper Body Lifting for Baseball - Driveline Baseball,2022-06-16T00:13:15+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/06/upper-body-lifting-for-baseball/,"If you are looking for a baseball upper body workout, start with considering exactly what you need. For players seeking to play at a high level, “workouts” should become a precise training plan. This distinction revolves around training for a task (your sport) rather than just “working out”. Changing your workouts this way will help you reach short and long-term goals.
“Where does upper body strength come into play?” is a common question for those new to baseball strength training. Upper body strength for baseball players is important because we stress our upper bodies constantly in training and on the field, and we need to prepare the body for those stresses to maximize performance. In sport, the body will go through a wide variety of positions at high speeds and under high stresses. To prepare for this, we need to develop strength and stability through wide ranges of motion.
What upper body lifts are good for baseball players will depend on the player and factors unique to their situation. Some of the factors that influence exercise selection are injury history, time of year, athlete goals, and training experience. With this in mind, we look to include exercises in both horizontal and vertical planes. In these planes, we then use both bilateral and unilateral movements. Overhead volume needs to be well managed since baseball players are overhead athletes. When building an upper body workout for baseball players, find exercises that are specific to the player’s needs. This is more important than specificity to the sport itself.
For younger or less trained baseball players, bodyweight exercises can be a great part of an upper body workout. These build foundational movement patterns and upper body strength. Pressing exercises such as push-ups and dips are a good starting place. These help achieve muscle growth for chest and triceps plus develop other muscles involved in stabilizing the trunk. When it comes to your posterior chain, inverted rows and pullups are a great entry to muscle growth and building strength. Variations of these exercises like T push-ups, neutral grip pull-ups, or using a suspension trainer for inverted rows help challenge the movements in new or different ways. Having the ability to move and control your body is needed to play at high levels.
One of the key movements for building the upper body is the horizontal push. Among the most common horizontal push exercises you will see in the driveline weight room is the bench press.
Many baseball players have been hesitant to bench due to factors like magnitude of load or perceived injury risk. And while these fears are legitimate for some, no one exercise is right or wrong for the sport. As mentioned above, it is best to tailor the exercise to the individual based on an assessment of their short and long-term needs and goals. Bench press is just one choice for a heavy bilateral upper body push, it shouldn’t be demonized or championed. Almost every element of the bench press can be modified. This can be done by changing the range of motion, the movement path, or by making it single arm. Some examples would be switching to incline or dumbbell bench press, or by using one dumbbell at a time.
One great way to challenge upper body strength and scapular stability is the landmine press. It does this with the scapula going through upward rotation with similar stressors to a bench or overhead press. The first landmine press we start athletes out with is often the Half-Kneeling Landmine Press. From there, we can progress to a standing landmine press or further to a split stance landmine press. Performing a push press is a good way to drive a more dynamic output with the landmine. Similarly, a landmine pivot press will bring in more rotation.
As mentioned above, landmine pressing includes some overhead motion and will share some functions with true vertical presses. Vertical pressing volume and intensity should be well planned around the athlete’s current throwing and other training demands, due to its overhead nature and typically greater taxation of the shoulder.
The jammer arm overhead press is one of our favorites for a higher load movement in this plane. Its fixed path and unilateral or bilateral options are an advantage over other options. The fixed path limits the stability demands and helps achieve the higher output. Overhead stability is still crucial and should be addressed in the training program, but not every adaptation for a muscle group needs to (or should) come from one exercise. For those without jammer arms, a smith machine or landmine can provide a more fixed path. Dumbbells or kettlebells can be a substitute for the vertical pressing strength stimulus without the fixed path.
When it comes to pulling exercises, the same planes apply. For horizontal pulls, our most used exercises are unilateral such as dumbbell three-point or a landmine Meadow’s row. We tend to choose single-arm over bilateral rows due to the torso stability demands of each. The rotational mobility and stability needed in the torso to execute single arm rows typically lines up better than the flexion/extension demands of an unsupported bilateral row. In your training plan, bilateral rows can still fit into a baseball upper body workout if they fit your needs. Bench supported and seal rows are our bilateral rows of choice, and don’t require the same stability demands as unsupported rows.  One advantage of bilateral rowing is incorporating more rotation by making the arms alternate.
Program vertical pulling exercises carefully due to their high lat demands, just like with the shoulder in vertical pressing. The most basic vertical pull is the pull-up. Especially for younger or less experienced athletes, it is also often one of the most challenging to properly execute. Regressing the pull-up to eccentric only or band-assisted pull-ups are two common ways to address this. Our favorite option is to have the athlete complete as many full reps as they can, then switch to eccentric only pull-ups to finish the set. One way to change it up is to switch to a lat pulldown to reduce the stability component. To further modify, switch to a unilateral version such as single-arm lat pulldowns.
Horizontal and vertical are not absolutes, but rather broad classifications that help when organizing these exercises. The landmine press or a high cable row are good examples of this gray area. These more diagonal movements also have greater shoulder rotation than a true horizontal press or pull. Take this into account when building upper body workouts into your baseball training plan. Athletes need to prepare their tissues in this way, as they will surely move on the field in ways that don’t fit into convenient planar buckets.

What is the Isometric Seal Row? - Driveline Baseball,2022-02-22T01:00:58+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/02/what-is-the-isometric-seal-row/,"The Isometric Seal Row (ISR) is a multi-joint isometric test athletes perform lying prone on an elevated bench with a barbell locked into place below them, as pictured below. We use this test in our assessment as a measure of upper-body absolute strength. It is unique in our assessment because the test uses ForceHooks to measure output rather than the dual force plate setup in our lower-body assessments. (To read about the rest of our assessment series, check out our assessment overview blog, and to learn more about how we tested ForceHooks read our validation blog.)
Multi-joint isometric tests (MJITs) show numerous benefits over other maximal force testing methods, for our specific needs and athlete population. Among these benefits, the main strengths are lower injury risk and less technical lifting skill required to execute the test.
When we were deciding what to include in our strength assessment, we compared the ISR to other maximal isometric testing options, such as an isometric bench press. We wanted a test that fit several criteria. First, the test needed to be easily standardizable with reliable data so that results can be compared across all athletes that assess.
Next, the test needed to fit within our athletes’ normal assessment week, which typically includes our full strength assessment as well as at least one high intent throwing session. Among other criteria, we wanted a test that utilized a high output pull or press so that we would be able to get as close as possible to each athlete’s maximal upper-body force production in one test.
The final criteria narrowed our search to a horizontal row or press, and while both a prone/seal row and a bench/floor press fit the first criteria, the press failed the second criteria (test subjects reported significantly more soreness from the pressing movements than from the row).
1. Athlete lays on seal row bench face down, with the barbell directly below the bottom of their chest.
2. To determine the bar height, the athlete makes a 90° angle at the elbow while gripping the barbell with hands directly below the elbows.
3. Trainer plays an audible buzzer countdown with three short beeps and one three-second beep signifying the start and duration of the pull. This lets the athlete know what to expect during the trials. This is the same protocol as our IMTP.
4. The athlete is instructed to:
a. “Grip the barbell, but do not create any tension until the timer reaches go.”
b. “On the count of the buzzer, pull yourself to the bar as quickly and with as much force as possible, as if you are trying to pull yourself through the bench.”
5. Have the athlete perform two warmup/familiarization trials, first at 60% RPE and then 75% RPE.
6. The athlete performs three trials at maximum effort with one-minute rest between (any trials showing an unsteady baseline, countermovement at the onset of the rep, or peak force achieved at the very end of the effort indicating a yanking motion are discarded).
7. If the third trial is more than 100N higher than the first or second trial, the athlete performs a fourth trial.
While familiarization benefits are minimal in an MJIT, we still want multiple reps before any max effort trials so that the athlete can get comfortable with the test as well as familiar with the protocols and buzzer. The reps at 60 and 75% appear to be effective for familiarization and preparation, as most athletes see their best performance in the first two maximal trials.
In any standardized test, controlling as many variables outside of the variable that’s being tested is essential to ensure trustworthy data. This is why we measure joint angles to determine bar height for each athlete, as we don’t want athletes of different limb lengths to have any advantages or disadvantages. We chose 90° after testing multiple elbow angles because athletes reported little to no soreness at that angle, likely due to the lower output than higher joint angles, and it was also quickly standardizable.
There is some degree of error in the measurement due to the difference between an athlete’s positioning between slack (measuring), partially tense (warm-up/familiarization reps), and fully tense (maximal reps). If an athlete’s angle appears significantly changed during the warm-up reps we can re-measure, but once they are at 100% bar height should remain constant.
While familiarization benefits are minimal in an MJIT, we still want multiple reps before any max effort trials so that the athlete can get comfortable with the test as well as familiar with the protocols and buzzer. The reps at 60 and 75% appear to be effective for familiarization and preparation, as most athletes see their best performance in the first two maximal trials.
In the ISR we primarily look at two metrics: Peak Force (PF) and Relative Peak Force (RPF). If you recall from the IMTP, we typically use Net Peak Force as our measure of absolute strength, but in this case, there is no bodyweight on the dynamometer so Net Peak Force=Peak Force. Peak Force from the ISR gives us a metric for absolute upper-body strength, essentially a picture of how much force the athlete can possibly exert using their (posterior) upper body.
Dividing the PF by the athlete’s bodyweight provides RPF, and gives additional insight by telling us whether an athlete is strong for their size. As with RPF in the IMTP, this number is especially important for athletes who have an emphasis on their body weight in their current training phase. For example, an athlete looking to add muscle mass would want to see their RPF maintain or even increase as they gain weight, indicating that the newfound mass is actually helping them exert more force. On the opposite side, an athlete looking to lose weight would want to see at least a proportional increase in their RPF, indicating that the lost weight didn’t cost them strength.
Given that the bar is fixed on both ends to a ForceHook, we are collecting data from both hooks to eventually analyze athlete upper body asymmetries. At this point, a greater sample size and a thorough analysis are both necessary to determine what constitutes a significant or actionable asymmetry.
The ISR using ForceHooks gives us an upper-body maximal strength test that can be easily implemented with athletes of all training ages. The test shows a moderate positive correlation to athlete skill results (pitch speed and bat speed), and will soon be incorporated into a new version of our predicted velocity metric.

Baseball Strength and Conditioning: Foundations of Strength - Driveline Baseball,2022-02-12T22:08:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/02/baseball-strength-and-conditioning-foundations-of-strength/,"By Brice Crider, High Performance
The Driveline Foundations of Strength course was created to provide coaches with a baseline education in strength and conditioning, specifically catered to training baseball players. This course was designed for high school or college coaches that are without access to a strength staff, strength coaches with limited experience working with baseball players, and skill/sport coaches looking to gain a more fundamental understanding of developing athletic performance.
In the amateur levels of baseball, improving the strength and conditioning side is often one of, or the lowest hanging fruit to improving the program as a whole by both enhancing performance and mitigating injury. Specifically, at the high school, junior college, Division III, and NAIA levels, where many teams lack access to a strength coach, gaining basic knowledge on the fundamentals and application of exercise science can help a coach make big strides in improving the general physical qualities of their team.
The course is split into six parts. The first is an introduction to basic strength and conditioning concepts and principles. This introduction covers everything from the Driveline High Performance Staff’s fundamental methods and beliefs, to basic anatomy and physiology, to the basics of applied exercise science. This section provides the fundamental base on which the actual programming and coaching will be built.
Next, we cover high-performance assessments, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and athlete range of motion in key joints. We discuss the importance of tracking athlete performance over time, what we use as KPIs in gym, and low-tech KPI’s that coaches can implement into their training without access to extensive and expensive facilities and resources. Lastly, we discuss the joint range of motions and other general factors coaches should be aware of when monitoring athletes over time.
Following assessments and KPI’s, we get into some specific fundamentals of programming. This includes how coaches can use Bondarchuk’s pyramid in making programming decisions, exercise progressions and regressions, exercise pairing examples, and programming in a group setting.
Programming baseball players is up next, as we detail building out training blocks and designing training periodization plans, specifically when looking to program an athlete for a full calendar year. This section gives  you a fundamental understanding of how to create a training plan designed around your athlete’s specific needs. Learn to work around environmental constraints and systematically progress that plan through the year. Learning the rules of how to program an athlete through the off-season, pre-season, and in-season is invaluable for both strength and skill coaches alike.
Lastly, this course will give you insight into the art of coaching in the weight room. Working from designing a warm-up, through interacting with athletes, and even into cueing specific exercises, it details valid assessment processes, exercise selections, and training accommodations for coaches on any budget with a variety of resource and facility constraints accounted for.
The exercise videos cover the dos and don’ts of our most popular programmed exercises. Beyond the how-to videos, also included are quizzes with visuals showcasing the most common mistakes we see, helping coaches understand how to correctly identify and cue athletes in the weight room. The course also comes with a full exercise library and a sample program progressing through accumulation, strength, and power block.
The FOS certification is all online and can be found with our other certifications here, and pairs well with the Foundations of Pitching course to provide a broad understanding of developing baseball players in throwing and strength training.

Thomas Ruwe: From not pitching in High School to throwing 98 MPH,2021-11-24T02:34:18+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/11/thomas-ruwe-from-not-pitching-in-high-school-to-throwing-98-mph/,"By Chris Langin, Pitching Trainer
“Why don’t you just play basketball?”
This question followed Thomas Ruwe growing up. There’s not exactly a surplus of 6 foot 7 inch human beings in the state of Nebraska, and given an unimpressive start to his baseball career, the hypothesis was he wasn’t participating in a sport that best leveraged his genetic gifts.
“The main reason I didn’t play basketball is because I never really loved it,” said Ruwe. “Another reason was I had a chest condition that affected my breathing. I had to have surgery on it before my senior year of high school. They literally put a metal bar in my chest and it stayed there until my second year of junior college.”
If the video doesn’t do it justice, the statistics, or lack thereof, suggested that Ruwe’s baseball career wouldn’t last long. He had one career varsity outing during his high school career and a fastball that never eclipsed 75 miles per hour.
“There were a lot of frustrations in high school,” said Ruwe. “It seemed like I was always battling some sort of injury. I really was not very good. The only reason I even had a varsity outing was because I couldn’t play on junior varsity as a senior.”
For most, after getting one sympathetic varsity outing in their high school career, the thought of playing college baseball wouldn’t even register. Ruwe had two things going for him, though.
For one, he was 6’7” and still growing. Second, and perhaps most vital, colleges are always in need of extra bodies to contribute toward their tuition costs.
“I remember going on a few college visits, but I wasn’t getting recruited for baseball. I was just going to see the campus and potentially walk on. Eventually, I reached out to the coach at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa. The coach sat me down and told me if I came there I would have to work my tail off because I would get redshirted immediately.”
Ellsworth was coming off a 17-win-season and couldn’t foresee a way that Ruwe could help them the following season. Ruwe, having literally no leverage to play elsewhere, enrolled at Ellsworth and began his college career.
“The first year at Ellsworth was full of a lot of realizing how much I needed to improve in order to compete at the junior college level. I only threw around 74 mph my first year.”
Following the redshirt season, Ruwe finally got an opportunity to display his talents in the spring of 2015. He managed a 9.85 ERA and walked 29 batters against 23 strikeouts in 28.1 innings pitched. His fastball velocity was in the high 70’s.
“I had a lot of walks and gave up a lot of runs, but for some reason I was adamant I could play at that level.”
He followed up that 2015 campaign by breaking his back into two places. As a result, he spent six months in a back brace. Ruwe wouldn’t throw a single pitch during the 2016 season. Every time he pitched during his third season his back got a little more sore.
“It wasn’t until my mom came and watched me throw in front of some scouts that I realized I had been pushing it too far,” Ruwe said. “I came off the mound and tried to sit in the dugout and essentially collapsed from pain in my back.”
Now a 4th year sophomore, Ruwe transferred to the University of Nebraska-Kearney and managed to earn a $1000 scholarship.
“When I got to UNK, I was just happy to be there. Happy to still be playing the game. I don’t think coaches had a lot of expectations for me… hell, I had little expectations for me,” Ruwe said.
During 2017, Ruwe was healthy enough to pitch, but was rarely needed. He wasn’t on the travel squad most weekends, and he once again walked more hitters than he struck out. He put up a 10.54 ERA.
Through four years of college, Ruwe’s best two seasons were likely the ones he spent redshirted. He had a career ERA north of 10, had walked 40 batters against just 33 strikeouts, and had suffered significant injuries.
“Ruwe was anywhere from 82 to 87 and struggled to throw strikes consistently,” said Andrew Riddell, who pitched with Ruwe at Nebraska-Kearney. “He was coming off previous back surgeries and couldn’t do the same workouts as the other guys on the roster and didn’t throw many innings at all. I thought his career would be over after college, as did many more.”
In 2018, he finally had some success, putting up a 4.35 ERA and striking out more batters than he walked for the first time in his career. He touched 90 for the first time during that fall, though he still sat around 84-86. Nonetheless, he was 23 years old. His story seemed destined to max out as going from a junior college walk on to an average Division II reliever.
“In the fall of my second year at Kearney, I would be ecstatic about throwing 88 and the prospect of touching 90 seemed a lot more intriguing, and I started putting more value in that. This may or may not have been because my college teammate Chris Langin—who was also my roommate—was into Driveline and their products early on, but to be honest I was still skeptical of the program at that time,” Ruwe said.
Nebraska-Kearney’s baseball program was cut following 2018. Ruwe transferred to Missouri Western for his 6th and final season of college. He put up his best season, striking out 41 against just 10 walks. Which is what you’d hope for from someone 2-3 years older than the average player on the field. He converted from reliever to starter halfway through the season, but suffered an arm injury right before the conference tournament.
“Once I got to Missouri Western, it was another challenge getting acclimated to a new program and a new pitching coach,” said Ruwe. “My arm slot slowly got lower and lower. We didn’t really use radar guns at Missouri Western, so I never really knew exactly how hard I was throwing. On the rare occasion we pulled it out, I was around 84-89.”
Following the arm injury he suffered prior to the conference tournament, Ruwe was pulled aside and told in no uncertain terms to “pitch through it,” seeing as he wouldn’t have a career after college.
“By the time I left Missouri Western, I had a busted arm and a busted love for baseball… but I stood on the field at the conference tournament and promised myself I wasn’t done yet,” Ruwe said.
Unfortunately, Ruwe wasn’t coming off a mild case of elbow inflammation. He was diagnosed with a partially torn UCL during the summer. He got a Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injection, which you aren’t exactly guaranteed to come back from, and wouldn’t be ready for 100% intensity for six months.
He was now 24-years-old, had a partially torn UCL, topping out at 91 on the best of days, and was coming off an average season against a bunch of 21-year-olds at a Division II school in the Midwest.
While he was adamant that he would continue trying to play following the conference tournament, some realities of life were becoming apparent.
“It really was a back and forth trying to decide if it even made sense for me to continue. I debated it a lot and there was a period where I almost decided it wasn’t for me. I worked on my family farm to help my dad in the summer. I didn’t find out what was wrong with my arm until the middle of June.”
As cliche as it sounds, Ruwe felt there was still “something whispering in my ear that I wasn’t done yet.”
“After saving up every bit that I could and a few frantic conversation with Julianne (now his wife) and Chris, I purchased my Driveline subscription and prepared to drive across the country with not much more than a dream and a belief that there was more left for me to give in my baseball career.”
In March 2020, Ruwe began his training at Driveline. It started off great; he hit 92 for the first time in his career.

But before the end of his first week, the COVID-19 pandemic closed down the Driveline facility.
“I was at Driveline for three days and had gotten one lifting session in when Chris called me and told me that Driveline was shutting down to in-gym athletes because of COVID policies. I went to train with an old summer ball teammate in the area who had a place for me to sleep and we trained together for a month while I waited to see if Driveline would open back up.”
“I drove back home to continue training at the facility in Fremont, Nebraska with Steve (his trainer since high school),” said Ruwe. “There I saw 95 off the mound for the first time in my career. In an empty gym, with no music playing, just a few high schoolers holding radar guns and Steve recording. I was performing my drop steps and walking windups as part of my online training with the annual plan and sending videos to Chris.”

During the summer, Driveline opened up a pop-up shop in Arizona. Ruwe traveled there and finally threw on radar tech for the first time in his career. There, Ruwe had his first pleasant surprise in his career. He was possibly the best in the world at spinning a fastball.
It still wasn’t all that good.
“We got to see my numbers on Rapsodo for the first time and learned that I could spin the ball really well. However, I was missing out on a ton of vertical and horizontal break because my efficiency was hovering around 70%. I was missing out on close to 1000 RPMs, rendering the skill of being able to spin the ball that well rather useless.”
The pitch didn’t have what you’d call “useful” cut for a fastball. It wasn’t getting true glove side action (think Corbin Burnes), much less relative cut (think Max Fried). While he could spin the ball over 3000 RPMs, he was getting less total movement than the average big league pitcher. Even when he maxed out in velocity, at 94-95 mph, he was still throwing a pitch that graded out nearly 50% below the average big league fastball.
The good news? You can’t really teach someone to impart that much raw spin on a fastball. But, you can teach them how to put a higher proportion of that spin towards useful movement. While getting the velocity up to a level that could get him signed was still of chief interest, we kept a keen eye on how his spin efficiency was progressing on the heater. A good portion of throwing economy went towards reps with Rapsodo feedback, providing cues that would enhance his efficiency.
We knew his raw RPMs would go down a bit, as inadvertent cut increases raw RPMs on fastballs (controlling for velocity change). For reference, of pitchers that averaged over 2500 RPMs on their four-seamers in 2021, the average spin efficiency was 84%, 8% below the big league average of 92%. But again, maximizing raw spin isn’t the end goal for maximizing the effectiveness of a fastball.
“That became a big goal, along with putting on more weight,” said Ruwe, “My lowest hanging fruits, if you will.”
The Washington Driveline opened up again in July 2020 and Ruwe could finally get his strength assessment in.
Historically a “hard gainer,” Ruwe had struggled for years to put on weight. His back issues had prevented him from doing many core lifts that most pitchers had no issues executing. Despite being 6’9”, his bodyweight wasn’t reliably above 200 pounds throughout his college career.
“I have always been trying to gain weight, but for so long I was also growing and wasn’t done developing into my adult body until I was almost 23,” Ruwe said.
When Ruwe went through his first strength assessment in July of 2020, his Squat Jump Peak Power (strongest correlator in HP dataset to velocity) of 4,770 watts was more than a standard deviation below his peers in the 90+ mph group. His force plate numbers were rather pathetic, with absolute and relative strength ranking in just the 2nd and 3rd percentile respectively amongst 90+ mph peers.
“I got back to Seattle after a month in Arizona and was putting more training economy into the weight room. I gained about 10 pounds and was moving really well down the mound during my lower intensity throwing. I used to think gaining weight was super difficult because I wasn’t eating enough.”Ruwe tried lots of things to gain weight, downing chocolate milk and eating ramen every night.“The game changer was when I started tracking my calories and made it a priority,” Ruwe said. “Knowing that my weight gain would have a big correlation to my gains on the mound…It forced me to own it or go home.”
Just 77 days later, he had gained nearly 1,000 watts on his jumps. His peak power had gone from being comparable to an average 19-year-old junior college pitcher to being firmly in the middle of the 90+ group. He had gotten up to 97 on his grey drop steps during his “end of week” throws.
“They gave me 3-5 throws to “let it eat” at high intensity at the end of each week, and I really looked forward to that. Other than that, they delegated everything towards getting stronger in the weight room.”
His relative and absolute strength improved significantly as well. Relative to 90+ mph throwers, Ruwe went from being in the 3rd and 2nd percentile in absolute and relative strength to the 57th and 33rd percentile over those two and a half months. A quick peek at his radar chart speaks for itself.
Based on our HP database, even if Ruwe were to not have had any improvements to his throwing mechanics, we’d expect a 2.9 MPH gain just because of the gains he made on the high performance side.
“The biggest thing in the weight room strength-wise was never running another pole since college,” Ruwe joked. “Realistically, just being on a schedule that was conducive to my throwing volume was the biggest thing. Prior to Driveline, I never prioritized recovering and didn’t match up my throwing well with my lifting.”
About a week before his September retest, on August 29th, Ruwe had a career changing day. During his “end of week” throws, he was feeling pretty good (and to be honest, he made a few more throws than the five he was prescribed, but dammit if it wasn’t for good reason).
Not everyday you see a 6’9″ human being performing a 🔥🔥🔥 Drop Step that isn’t in the low post. @ruwe_1995 pic.twitter.com/NrVikn6T0f
He took home four velo records at Driveline. The 225g step back, and all the drop step records except for the 450g ball. While it wasn’t a baseball, he saw triple digits on the radar gun for the first time in his life.
“Seeing triple digits light up on the radar gun for the first time was a top three feeling in my life, behind marrying my wife and my first professional save,” Ruwe said. “Getting my name on the record wall at Driveline was kind of the culmination of so much hardship and struggle and finally seeing some actual evidence of the work paying off.”
Following the conclusion of Ruwe’s strength phase, it was time to see if the velocity would convert to the 5 ounce baseball off the mound.
At this point, enough moderate intensity Rapsodo work had been done that he was no longer inadvertently cutting his fastball. There were still issues with it, specifically that it was in the “dead zone,” but his spin was significant enough to offset some vulnerabilities that come with that type of fastball. Nonetheless, every tick he could get on his fastball would be needed to get signed.
In his motion capture retest, he destroyed his previous personal best off the mound. He sat 95-96, peaking at 96.8, just a tenth of a tick below the record in the lab for 230+ pound pitchers.

Compared to his initial motion capture in March, he saw significant improvements in nearly all variables that are associated with increases in velocity—specifically, his kinematic velocities.
Throughout his first athlete meeting, the biggest points of interest were improving elbow flexion and hip-shoulder separation.
3-13-2020: Max: 103, FP: 85
9-10-2020: Max: 120, FP: 98
3-13-2020: Max: 2370
9-10-2020: Max: 2650
Elbow flexion plays a moderate role in enhancing a pitcher’s ability to increase the velocity at which they extend their elbow. Ruwe increased his max elbow flexion by 17 degrees. Throughout the entire dataset, the r value between max elbow flexion and max elbow extension angular velocity is 0.33. When looking at intra-athlete correlations, the r value is still 0.18. That’s enough to emphasize it given its teachability and its impact on increasing elbow extension velocity, one of the stronger correlations to ball velocity in the entire dataset.
3-13-2020: 180
9-10-2020: 192
Ruwe also increased how much shoulder external rotation (layback) he got in the throw. While it’s foolish for anyone to try to say exactly which portion of the training improved this, we know that external rotation is extremely valuable for producing ball velocity, as it allows the athlete to apply force to the baseball for a longer period of time.
Ruwe certainly wasn’t hurt by his increase in elbow flexion here, as it is generally easier to get into more external rotation when pulling back a shorter lever. His elbow flexion improved at max ER as well, when that would appear to be most useful for enhancing this range of motion.
Admittedly, and an excellent case study in the need to be vulnerable in your initial assessment, Ruwe actually lost hip-shoulder separation despite throwing four miles per hour harder. While his drills were tailored towards enhancing this separation, it didn’t happen. With the history of his back issues, it’s possible that his back was a limiting factor. That said, he found another way to generate elite velocity despite being told 6 months prior that improving hip-shoulder separation would be vital in his pursuit of 95+.
This points to the value of self-organization rather than prescribing exact mechanical changes. If the athlete sees improvement without improving mechanically in departments you inferred would aid in their velocity development, your priors should be updated.
At the end of the day, the gains in the weight room likely attributed to most of the improvement in Ruwe’s velocity during that 6-month window.
After a couple weeks of getting back a feel for the slope, Ruwe was ready to showcase his arsenal. He had just turned 25 and the 2020 MLB off-season had begun. Despite the unbelievable gains he had made over the last 6 months, he still needed to put on a clinic to have a chance at getting signed.
MiLB teams were getting cut, and the lack of a minor league season didn’t offer any opportunities for pitchers in organizations to pitch themselves out of a job. His college statistics were brutal, and nobody knew what his command would look like with an additional 10 miles per hour behind his pitches.
After generating some initial interest by sitting 96-97, a Brewers scout was sent to watch Ruwe pitch a week later. Everything clicked, with him sitting 96-97 again, and setting another personal best in velocity, this time at 97.9.
Top Heaters from @ruwe_1995 yesterday. Came to Driveline in March and set a PR at 92.9 during his motion capture… things seem to be going… well. Reliably ~29-3000 RPM’s on the Fastball during this + previous bullpens. @FlatgroundApp pic.twitter.com/KZXySP5SZu
“Throwing in front of the Brewers scout was a mix of emotions. I was excited that a scout finally, for the first time in my career, took interest in me. It was also nerve-racking because that was the only team looking into me.”
A week later, Ruwe had created a bit of leverage with his performances. With multiple teams in the running, he wound up signing a professional contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. The kid who couldn’t break 90 miles per hour two years prior, and was recovering from a partial UCL tear a year ago, was now inking an affiliate contract at 25-years-old with a $20,000 signing bonus.
While the impossible had happened for Ruwe, there was still work that needed to be done to increase the probabilities he could climb up the system.
That started with fixing that dead zone fastball.
“Chris had mentioned his concerns with my fastball profile previously, but felt to make changes we’d need a decent amount of time in a stress-free environment. Seeing as I was trying to get signed, that wasn’t the time to make that change,”
To get Ruwe out of the dead zone, he’d have to change the spin direction of his fastball. Re-patterning the throw like this is seldom practical. The benefits that come with a more over the top slot (for those stuck in the dead zone) are quite obvious—and, undoubtedly, more people would attempt this if success rates were high. Anecdotally, significant manipulation of anterior trunk tilt like this often leads to an unnatural movement for an athlete, thus risking a decrease in velocity.
However, when you’re 25-years-old and not anywhere near a prospect, you have little to lose. This made Ruwe an optimal candidate for experimentation.
Torso anterior tilt essentially “sets” up an athlete’s arm slot. The more extended they are at foot plant (over the heels), generally the higher their release height. In the GIFs above, the athlete’s respective slots are decided by their torso position at foot plant. As the torso rotates towards the plate to deliver the ball, the arm will follow behind, with the eventual result being an arm slot that stays on that same plane throughout release.
Our data fits this logic. Nearly 20% of the variability in vertical break between athletes in our database can be explained by their torso anterior tilt at foot plant.
Given Ruwe’s history of being nudged toward a sidearm delivery, there was some confidence that selling out for a higher three-quarters slot was a possibility. To date, his velocity was increasing with the more traditional three-quarter slot he was throwing from. His release height, because of his 81-inch height and 86-inch wingspan, was already relatively high (~6.3-6.4 feet) relative to big league averages (6 feet), which presented no unique benefits for his current fastball characteristics.
Looking at historical MLB data, and controlling for intra-pitcher changes in release height, a linear model would project that an increase of 1 inch in release height would cause an increase of 0.25 inches of vertical break on average.
The ultimate practical example is Justin Verlander.
Verlander improved the whiff rate on his fastball considerably, with no drastic increases in velocity, spin, or spin efficiency. The spin direction of the fastball had simply adjusted upward an additional 15-20 minutes, resulting in nearly three extra inches of carry.
After an off-season of video feedback, Rapsodo feedback, and cueing, Ruwe was able to reliably achieve the desired shape during bullpens and live at-bat settings. However, the real challenge would be whether he’d be able to maintain the profile during the season.
Prior to heading out for his first professional season, Ruwe shattered one more Plyo Ball ® record, this time reaching back for 101 on a grey step back.
“To see where he is at now and how far he has come is unbelievable,” said Ridell. “He definitely isn’t the same pitcher who was struggling for innings at a Division II University in Nebraska… he deserves everything that his hard work has got him.”
Now it was time to compete, for the first time in 2 years.
His first season got off to a cold start. He was in A-ball, 25-years-old, and couldn’t get anybody out.
Ruwe was sent to the extended site after his first 6 outings in Low-A. His velocity was back down to the low 90’s and he was struggling to find the strike zone.
“If there was a definition of a roller coaster season, it was my first one in pro ball,” Ruwe said.
After the six-outing pit stop and getting recalled from extended, he began making quick work of hitters, striking out 27 against 9 walks over 15 and a third innings pitched. That was enough to earn him a promotion to High-A.
The success carried over to High-A, where he struck out over 42% of the batters he faced. Hitters had an OPS. of .481 against him in his nine outings in Vancouver. Ruwe put up a 42% K rate and a 1.92 FIP after being recalled on June 25th. Both were 95th percentile across A and High-A relievers with at least 25 innings over that stretch.
His stuff had returned as well. While in Vancouver, his average fastball velocity was 94.3, reaching as high as 99 on the stadium radar gun. His four-seam characteristics were also exactly what we intended them to look like when making the arm slot change.
During his time in Vancouver, his spin rate would’ve ranked 1st among major league pitchers. His 21.6 inches of total movement would be amongst the top 5, behind Jharel Cotton, Demarcus Evans, and Michael Kopech.
The pitch was synonymous with the Verlander profile discussed earlier. Ruwe’s average release height was 82.5 inches, and he induced 19.3 inches of vertical break on average. The velocity was 94.3.
Verlander’s averages? 82.8 inch release height,19.5 inches of induced vertical break, and 94.8 miles per hour.
The ball flight characteristics of the pitch were good for a stuff+ of 165, 65% above a big league average fastball. The pitch had tripled in stuff from the time it was first thrown at Driveline Arizona.
He paired that with a sweeping slider, which averaged 14 inches of sweep at 81 miles per hour, good for a stuff+ of ~130 relative to big league breaking balls.
Of Ruwe’s 49 strikeouts, he got 24 of them with the four-seamer, and 25 with the slider.
Despite the success at High-A, Ruwe is still headed towards a make or break year with the Blue Jays. He’ll be 26-years-old without a single Double-A inning to his name.
If he can finish the story, and accomplish his dreams of becoming a big leaguer, he’ll be amongst the most unlikely of the 22,000 that have donned a big league jersey.
“Throughout this journey, there were a lot of places I wanted to give up, or actually, maybe some places people would think I should have given up. If there is anything I have learned, it’s that believing in yourself and having a solid support system can get you as far as your dreams will carry you. Getting to where you need to be is listening to the voice in your head telling you to try one more time.”

Free 6-Week Strength Training Program for Baseball Players,2021-10-21T23:56:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/10/free-strength-training-program-baseball/,"By Steffen Simmons and Daniel Comstock, High Performance
Driveline High Performance staff members are regularly asked by well-meaning parents and athletes something along the lines of, “What is the best strength program for baseball players?” While the question is valid, the unfortunate answer is: “It depends.” There is no best one-size-fits-all program.
When an athlete comes in for an assessment, we look at as many variables as possible. Athletes are then given an appropriate program based on a variety of factors, including age, training and injury history, athlete goals, and current physical qualities. We decided to release this free six-week training block that fits a wide range of the needs previously listed.
Many of our programs are concurrent in nature. That means we train multiple qualities (hypertrophy, strength, and power) to some degree in every block. This six-week program focuses on gaining strength. But an athlete should also gain size and improve power output over its course.
Due to the training economy demands of these baseball workouts, it will likely be best suited for a pitcher in some type of velocity or high intent phase, or a hitter who is coming off an accumulation or hypertrophy block. For pitching and hitting, this phase will likely come about a quarter of the way into the off-season. Power and preseason phases would follow before the competition season begins.
With a sample size of 42, these are the average retest results of athletes that have completed this program:
While many other factors contribute to throwing harder or swinging the bat faster, training the physical qualities is certainly one piece of the puzzle. All of these metrics show at least moderate positive correlation with pitching velocity and bat speed.
We cannot guarantee improved velocity or bat speed, but we can say when athletes put work in the weight room, physical qualities improve.

High Performance: 2021 College Summer Recap - Driveline Baseball,2021-09-27T23:08:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/high-performance-2021-college-summer-recap/,"By Brice Crider, High Performance
This summer, the High Performance Staff ran 617 strength assessments with 182 of those being with athletes that trained for at least 6 weeks and retested within 2 weeks of completing a program. The average overall score went from a 53 to a 60, a 13.2% gain, over the course of a 6 week training block.
High Performance Gains by Phase
When viewing high performance gains grouped by lifting phase, it is important to keep in mind that the programs within these phases are largely concurrent—which means that all general qualities (hypertrophy, strength, power, speed, reactive strength) are being trained to some extent throughout each program. The name of the phase merely indicates which quality is the focus. An easy metaphor to understand this is a series of dimmer switches. As the focus changes from phase to phase, the ratios of training stimuli change as well. For an athlete who is able to train for a full summer (18 weeks, 3 phases), the typical progression is accumulation, strength, then power.
Accumulation
Accumulation phases (focused on hypertrophy and building work capacity) are where we saw our largest average gains in our six key metrics. This is largely due to the fact that a summer athlete who is put into an accumulation phase is typically physically underdeveloped and will reap the largest benefit from increasing muscle mass and general work capacity, as they are further away from their genetic ceiling. During an accumulation phase, athletes are usually in an on-ramp throwing phase. This is important to note because it allows us to allocate more of their training economy into the weight room, which we would expect to yield larger gains in our high performance retest metrics.
Strength
The majority of athletes in college summer go directly into strength phases, as not every athlete can spend the full 18 weeks at Driveline for the full progression. Typically, athletes that arrive prepared for a velocity throwing phase will not go into an accumulation phase in the weight room, as we generally do not pair the high volumes of accumulation with the high acute stressors of a velocity phase.
Strength phases tend to be lower in overall volume, allowing athletes to push intensity in order to make gains in absolute strength, measured by the Isometric Mid Thigh Pull.
Power
Power phases have the least amount of participants during college summer, due to the fact that many athletes are only in the gym long enough for one phase and typically go into a strength phase. The athletes that do go straight into a power phase generally have a larger training history and are more adapted than their counterparts.
These athletes usually have already built a solid foundation of size and strength, and now need to make more specific power gains. Because they are already so adapted and closer to their genetic ceiling, making further gains becomes more and more difficult. Another important consideration is that during power phases, athletes are typically in velocity or pre-competition phases on the throwing side, so there is less training economy for weight room gains. Power is tested in the Squat Jump and Countermovement Jump.
Changes in Predicted and Actual Velocity
One of the best ways to contextualize improvements in general physical qualities is using our Predicted Velocity Calculator. This tool not only allows for communication with the athlete on how these gains can affect velocity but can also provide context to why an athlete may (or may not) have made a velocity jump during the course of a block.
The average athlete at Driveline this summer gained 1.40 mph in predicted velocity per 6-week strength phase, while in reality, they gained 2.10 mph of actual velocity from mocap test to retest. Although it is impossible to say for sure, a likely explanation for the difference between predicted and actual velocity in such a large data set is that movement changes and skill acquisition on the throwing side positively affected the athlete’s velocity as well.
Unsurprisingly, the phase patterns of predicted and actual velo are opposite. Athletes made the largest predicted velocity gains in accumulation phases (when weight room volume is the highest and throwing intensity is usually low) and made the largest actual velocity gains in power phases (when weight room volume is low, and athletes are usually in a velocity phase).

Case Study: The Importance of In-Season Training - Driveline Baseball,2021-08-05T00:30:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/case-study-the-importance-of-in-season-training/,"Written by Brice Crider
As college athletes return from their seasons to train for the summer, the importance of in-season strength training is often made incredibly apparent. Many athletes work diligently all offseason, then stop or significantly scale back on strength training during the season, and then find themselves detrained and back to square one after the season is over.
One athlete that returned to Driveline after his college season is a perfect example of this. This athlete came to us in late August of 2020 and averaged 85.9 mph during his first motion capture assessment.
We identified a few inefficiencies in his initial assessment, with a lack of scapular retraction on the throwing arm being one of the most glaring (it was 34 degrees below average when compared to our normative data on elite-level throwers). We spent the next three months aiming to improve throwing velocity with an emphasis on improving scap retraction during the throw.
During his last in-gym retest in December 2020, this same athlete averaged 90.3 mph and had gained nearly 20 degrees of scap retraction (up to 53 degrees). After his 2021 college season, this athlete came back and went through another motion capture report. Despite no significant changes in kinematic positioning from his previous motion capture report in December (he still had 53 degrees of scap retraction), this athlete’s kinematic velocities were down in every metric, and he only averaged 85.03 mph.
The lack of significant changes in the mocap report tells us that the main reasons for the decrease in velocity are likely due to factors other than changes in throwing mechanics.
When this athlete had his strength retest, his numbers were significantly down in strength, power, and reactive strength compared to his previous retest in December, while his body weight was the same.
During his post-retest meeting to go over his mocap and strength retest results, he told us that at college he was only allowed to strength train one day per week, and that day was only one lower body strength exercise followed by mobility exercises, with a good bit of aerobic conditioning as well.
This led us to suspect that detraining during the season could be a reason for his significant losses in strength, power, and reactive strength and decreased performance on the mound.
Although some detraining and loss of off-season gains in general physical qualities may be inevitable for higher level athletes, getting significantly worse during the season is unacceptable from a high performance standpoint.
This massive detraining can leave an athlete unprepared in the playoffs when performance matters most—and completely back to the spot they previously were when they begin the offseason.
When programming athletes in-season, the goal is to mitigate fatigue and prepare the athlete for competition, which means lowering volume while still giving them a healthy balance of training general adaptations.
In-season training can often be as simple as this: Give the athlete what they’re not getting on the field or in practice. Baseball players will likely be getting plenty of rotational volume and sprint volume in both practice and in the game, meaning they’ll need less of it in their training, but still need strength and power work to maintain performance.
This in-season training stimulus can vary based on the athlete’s current level; an 18-year-old high school senior should be looking to progress speed, strength, and power in-season, whereas a 25-year-old minor leaguer is unlikely to get significantly stronger or more powerful in-season because he is closer to his genetic ceiling and more stimulus would be required to reach further adaptations.
Although more adapted individuals are likely to detrain slower than their less adapted counterparts, the rule still applies: If you don’t use it, you lose it.
The table below provides the typical durations for the residual effects of different fitness components.
It is important to keep in mind these are general guidelines and not hard and fast rules as each athlete is an individual. Train in-season accordingly, adjusting volume based on the qualities that are likely to detrain the fastest.

Managing Stress and The Stress Mechanism - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-29T00:48:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/managing-stress-and-how-it-will-help-your-recovery/,"So far our recovery blog series has included articles on the basics of recovery, optimizing nutrition, and sleep environment and hygiene. Now we’ll dive into the mechanism of stress, the differences between acute and chronic stress and their impact on performance, and useful strategies to manage stress.
To understand stress management, you must first understand the mechanism of stress. To quote Dr. Andrew Huberman, “Stress is a generic system used to mobilize other systems in the brain and body to respond.”
Stress is simply a hormone-regulated physiological response to stressors (things that stress). This means that the general response to stressors does not differentiate between mental and physiological stress, a concept that is often misunderstood in the training process.
There is a difference, however, between acute (short term) and chronic (long term) stress.
Training is a carefully balanced system of stress and stressors. If you don’t acutely stress the system at all, there will be no adaptations. Stress the system too much without recovering, however, or undergo a massive acute stressor without having enough stress tolerance built up, and suffer the consequences.
Stress management can be as simple as this: Monitor acute stress and progress as needed to allow the system to tolerate more stress; regress as needed to allow the system to recover.
You can facilitate recovery from acute stress to prevent chronic stress and chronically high cortisol levels with simple strategies to encourage parasympathetic nervous system activation. You can’t control your physiology and your hormones, but you can control systems that massively affect them.
Firstly, the most effective tool to recover from stress is quality sleep. Sleep deprivation is correlated with elevated cortisol levels and a higher risk of injury. For more information on improving sleep, please refer to the sleep environment and hygiene blog.
Another applicable tool to downregulate the stress response is breathing. When breathing at rapid rates typically associated with stressors, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, but when breathing rates are slowed, there is more parasympathetic dominance.
One such strategy to slow breathing rates and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system is “The Physiological Sigh”—taking a large inhale through the nose, and then another large inhale through the nose before exhaling, followed by an extended exhale through the mouth, repeated several times. This strategy can increase oxygen levels in the blood and slow the heart rate, helping the parasympathetic nervous system take over.
Lastly, a key strategy for managing stress is establishing and connecting with a healthy social support network. Having healthy relationships with others in your life can help minimize stressors outside of training, as well as have very positive hormonal effects.
Having a social support system that you spend time with is strongly correlated with lowered cortisol and blood pressure, whereas having limited social contact with friends and loved ones is linked to higher cortisol levels, a lowered immune system, and increased rates of depression.
This is because spending time with people you have deeper, more positive connections with releases serotonin, a neuromodulator hormone that increases feelings of well-being and helps with sleeping and digestion (parasympathetic nervous system).
So, saying “I can’t hang out with my friends or family because I need to focus on my recovery” typically is not correct. As long as your relationships are healthy and don’t negatively impact your sleep or any other healthy habits, spending time with people you care about could be one of the most vital recovery modalities you have.

Putting ForceHooks to the test - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-02T00:45:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/putting-forcehooks-to-the-test/,"ForceHooks are a portable dynamometer that can be secured to a weight room rack as shown below. The other end of the device is modular, currently featuring an eye bolt, a hook designed to secure a barbell, and an open attachment for handheld resistance measurements.
The ability to secure between a barbell and a rack is groundbreaking in that the device can be used to measure any barbell isometric exercise. This could make for a portable setup for the Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull (IMTP), like what we use in our strength assessment process. However, it could be done without the need for force plates or tests of which the output would be difficult to measure, even with force plates (i.e., an isometric row).
Before implementing the ForceHooks with our athletes in any capacity, we needed to validate the device’s accuracy. Using our portable dual-force plates from ForceDecks, we were able to set up an IMTP rig as shown below.
To reduce potential error that could occur from the setup of the rig and not the devices, we placed a plywood layer under the plates to account for the slight give of the rubber gym flooring. We also opted for a stiff 29mm power bar in place of a typical barbell to minimize the bend of the bar during the pull.
With a sample size of 65 trials, we compared the full signal force traces from the ForceHooks to the force plates and then calculated the difference between the two signals at each sample.
To get a better idea of how the magnitude of the pull affects the error of the hooks we also looked at a Bland Altman plot which illustrates how the error changes across varying magnitudes of a measure. This tells us if the error in measurement changes when a trial shows high vs. average or low forces.
Here is what we found:
With an average max force error of -28.97 N (~1%) and an r^2 for the full force trace of 0.979, we feel very confident implementing the ForceHooks. Their versatility will open up new isometric assessment options that previously were not feasible, including potentially expanding our strength assessment to include upper body force production.

How and Why We Incorporate Med Balls - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-08T00:41:17+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/how-and-why-we-incorporate-med-balls/,"This blog was inspired by some really good questions we have received from youth coaches across the country. When we post what the Driveline Academy is doing on social media, we usually get questions immediately about how and why we do the things we do. In this article, I will talk about the how and why behind medicine balls in the Academy.
Here are four questions that were asked (referencing 12U and younger), along with our responses.
Referencing this video:
Here's some med-ball drills that we have implemented into our hitter's programs. Can improve rotational power and sequencing. @JoelMcKeithan pic.twitter.com/9QZkcpkkGp
We avoid the rope med balls for our academy only because we want to be cautious and aware of the injury risk they pose for young players. The rope med ball exercises require much more technique instruction, as well as constant supervision. Having anywhere from 30-50 kids training in one session with the rope med ball exercises is asking for trouble. They pose a high risk for very low reward. (That said, we have now transitioned to rope med ball exercises as a warm up for our older hitters in the gym. Those exercises are in the position of offset open and offset closed stance.)
The regular med balls help with the output we are specifically encouraging. We want our players to move fast, so taking a med ball and throwing it against the wall as hard and as fast as they can accomplishes that safely and easily. The rope med ball (especially with the younger ages) would not do that optimally.
Referencing these videos:
Driveline Academy 9U aka The Electric FactoryYou catch more bees with honey, and you get more buy in with young kids by keeping training as fun as possible. pic.twitter.com/KNDteqNs7b
Playing baseball IS playing multiple sports.(at least here it is) pic.twitter.com/fMFFZm5man
The med ball relays are essentially just games to develop athleticism. They teach kids how to problem solve by moving quickly while carrying an object, all while competing and having fun, so there is benefit to this type of training even if it isn’t baseball specific. The game that asks them to put the med ball on a bench/box introduces an added constraint that requires the kids to decelerate their bodies in order to intentionally put the ball somewhere, rather than just dropping it or handing it off. We want kids to problem solve to create optimal movements within the games. That usually revolves around moving their bodies or an object as quickly as possible to complete a task.
Check out our Youth Practice Games Book! 47 Easy to implement games you can plug and play into a practice plan.
The weights of the med balls can vary depending on the drill/game. My recommendation for a 12u or younger team is the lighter the better when doing anything rotational or involving throwing. For the carrying drills/games, choose a weight where the majority of the kids don’t look like they are struggling to accomplish the task. One of the relay games we have done is a mystery ball relay. The player doesn’t know what weight the ball is because they are similar sizes and the same color and in a pile. The weights vary from 2 to 12 pounds.
Understanding and being able to explain the “why” behind drills is super important. Because sometimes people wonder: “If it doesn’t look like baseball specifically, is it really helping the kids be better baseball players?”
TO EVERYONE…
YES!
Movement experience is how I like to look at athleticism. The more environments kids get put in, the more movement experience they will gain, which can lead to athleticism.
Here is an analogy that makes sense to me.
If you put Kid A on the same playground everyday, they will be able to maneuver around it better each time. But problem solving—i.e. how they move through the playground—will most likely not vary much. If you put Kid B—who only has experience playing in nature (climbing trees, rocks, hills etc.)—on the same playground, Kid B will maneuver the playground not only better/quicker but they will maneuver it way differently and most likely more efficiently because of the different experiences they had prior.
When training youth athletes, it is important to give them the opportunity to train in multiple environments so that they become better athletes. In these environments, the task goals should be framed around problem solving, moving fast, moving an object fast, intent in accelerating or decelerating, competing and HAVING FUN!
These questions are awesome, and I personally love diving in and responding to them! Some come from social media but we get most of them from our Driveline PLUS members, who have access to us and ask these types of questions frequently. If you are interested in joining the PLUS community (which I highly recommend), just click here.
It is a place to grow as a coach and player, but I have also found it to be a great resource for parents who want to learn more about the game and training processes to help coach their son or daughter’s youth team.

Optimizing Nutrition for Better Recovery and Performance - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-02T01:40:41+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/optimizing-nutrition-for-better-recovery-and-performance/,"In the first part of this blog series, we briefly touched upon the importance of nutrition to your recovery. In this blog, we are going to dive deeper and explain the basics of optimizing your nutrition to recover as quickly and completely as possible. If you haven’t already read the pilot article of this series, I recommend you check that out first.
When trying to make a change to your diet or eating habits, it’s important to remember that there is no single best diet or best food to be eating. As Stan Efferding famously states, “The best diet is the one you’ll stick to, the best exercise program is the one you’ll do. Compliance is the science.”
“Compliance is the science”. Whether you’re looking for a new diet or a new training program, it’s important to remember that the best plan is the one you’ll follow. pic.twitter.com/PodpHKzj3w
This quote has stuck with me ever since I first heard it when I was a freshman in college, trying to find the special diet that would get me jacked or make me throw harder. In reality, there is no magic diet or magic food, and results, especially with nutrition, will require consistency over time—which is why finding the diet that supports your goals and that you’ll stick to will benefit you the most.
In working order of nutritional importance, calorie balance comes first. Unless you have a rare underlying medical condition, your caloric balance will determine whether or not you gain, maintain, or lose weight. Below is the basic caloric balance needed to achieve the listed goals.
Gain weight: Calorie surplus
Maintain weight: Calorie maintenance
Lose weight: Calorie deficit
A calorie refers to a measurement of energy. Your body burns a certain amount of calories, or energy daily. The total amount of calories you burn each day is based on your total daily energy expenditure, or TDEE. Your TDEE is made up of the following; basal metabolic rate or how many calories you burn at rest, non-exercise activity thermogenesis (calories burned from walking, tapping, yard work, etc.), thermic effect of food (how many calories are burned from digesting food), and lastly exercise activity thermogenesis(the calories burned from exercise).
Improper caloric balance is typically the most common thing that prevents athletes from meeting their body weight goals. If you’re trying to gain weight but are not, for example, then you are very likely just not eating enough and so should eat more.
When determining how many calories you need to eat to reach your goals, there are a few different factors to account for. The first is calculating how many calories you need to maintain your current body weight.
This can be done in a variety of ways, such as using online calculators or, most commonly, tracking your food and bodyweight daily for 7 days and then reassessing. If your body weight has been roughly the same (+/- ~2lbs) for an extended period of time, you can assume that the average number of calories you’ve been eating is your maintenance level caloric intake.
After finding out your maintenance level caloric intake, the next factor to take into consideration is how quickly you want to reach your goals. If you have twenty weeks until your competition season starts and your goal is to gain 10lbs, that might dictate a much different path than if you had only five weeks to drop the weight.
Now that you have found your maintenance level caloric intake and have established your goals, we can move on to determining how many calories you should be eating to meet these goals. It takes a surplus of 3500 calories to gain one pound and a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.  Once you take that into consideration, the rest is fairly simple math.
If you want to gain one pound a week, you know you need to be in a 3,500 calorie surplus over the course of the week, or a 500 calorie surplus daily. If maintaining or improving body composition is a priority, then taking a slower route (~0.5lb/week, 250 calorie daily deficit) is probably preferable.
Before we dive into the specifics of protein, let’s first go over what protein is and what it does (the next sentence is a bit technical, but we’ll break it down further so stick with me).
Proteins are biochemical molecules consisting of polypeptides that are joined by peptide bonds between the amino and carboxyl groups of amino acid residues. Basically, you can think of protein as the main building block of your muscle and lean tissue. There are many different types of proteins throughout our body. They aid the body in many different functions such as digestion, muscle contraction, maintaining connective tissue structure, and hormone regulation. Due to their role in those functions, protein is very important for athletes.
Now that we have established what protein is and why it is important to our bodies, we can cover how much protein athletes need. You only need about 0.8g per kg of bodyweight per day to prevent a deficiency. Depending on numerous factors such as eating habits, body composition, goals and more, protein intake at 1.6-1.8g/kg of bodyweight should be sufficient for most athletes.
In a meta analysis from Morton, et al., they found that increasing protein intake much past 1.6 g/kg/day did not increase lean body mass. This does not mean that protein intakes exceeding 1.6g/kg/day are inherently bad; it just means that you can better allocate your calories elsewhere.
Protein is very satiating compared to carbohydrates, meaning that it leaves you feeling fuller, longer. This is important to note if you are a person who struggles with feeling full all the time when trying to gain weight, or feeling hungry all the time when trying to lose weight.
Raising or lowering your protein intake to match your goals and eating habits is your best bet to finding a sustainable and healthy diet.
Here is a list of quality sources of protein that you can add into your diet to help hit your daily protein goals.
After you have taken care of your calorie and protein needs, the next step is to monitor your intake of fat and carbohydrates. First, let’s focus on carbs and learn what they are and their role in the body.
Carbs are the sugars, starches, and fibers found in food. Carbs provide the body with glucose, which is stored in muscles as well as the liver and used for energy. Carbs are classified typically as either complex or simple. Generally speaking, simple carbs such as sugar are absorbed more quickly than complex carbs like those found in potatoes, which digest at a slower rate. Due to this, the timing of your carb intake can matter.
Typically, you should choose a simple carb option closer to competition or training and more complex carb options throughout the rest of your day. Carbs are an important energy source during exercise, especially during short, explosive movements such as swinging a baseball bat or throwing a pitch, due to the glycogen demands of explosive actions. The quantity of carbs consumed can be adjusted higher or lower just like protein, based on time of year, goals of the athlete, and eating history.
Fats play a critical role in the body. They assist brain function and regulating hormone activity. Your brain consists mostly of cholesterol and fat, so you can begin to see the importance of having adequate fat in your diet. When it comes to calories, fats contain 9 calories per gram, over twice as dense as protein or carbohydrates, which both contain 4 calories per gram. Due to this, fats are not as satiating as protein or carbs calorie for calorie.
For men, lack of fat intake reduces testosterone and other hormones that are critical for reproductive health. For women, inadequate fat intake can cause infertility and increase complications from PMS. The specific source of fat is also important for your health.
Generally, steer clear of vegetable oils and opt for healthier alternatives. Avocados, grass fed butter, animal fats, and extra virgin olive oil are great options for improved health and performance. A good rule of thumb is to try and get Omega 3 fats in a 2:1 ratio to Omega 6s.

How a high school sophomore gained strength and improved bat speed,2021-05-27T01:37:48+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/how-a-high-school-sophomore-improved/,"The idea of lifting for a high school athlete is usually an afterthought, even though it is often one of the most crucial parts of their development. Emmett Weichbrodt saw the benefits of starting a structured development plan early, hitting six days a week and lifting 3 days a week at Driveline.
Weichbrodt came to the gym in late November, showing above-average strength and power for the high school level in his initial strength assessment. Starting in an already impressive place for a high schooler, now after his most recent assessment, he’s going into his sophomore baseball season with the metrics that match an above average college baseball player based on in-gym averages.
Train at Driveline
We started him on a relatively high-volume strength program to build a foundation of work capacity and to attack the lowest hanging fruit for a young high school athlete. This gave him the stimulus needed to for gaining strength and lean mass. After building a solid foundation of strength and volume, we moved Emmett through two phases with reduced volume, progressing from strength to power focus.
Before we get into the specific numbers, the graphs you will see below have white and red lines. The white lines represent in-gym averages for each metric. The red lines are one standard deviation above and below the mean. For comparison purposes, we are putting this athlete into the college athlete category so the norms shown are for in-gym college athletes.
Lift consistently and eat in a caloric surplus is simple and yet it’s incredibly effective.
We watched Emmett go from weighing 174.6 on November 25th to weighing 192.5 during his last retest on April 7 before he started his season. That 18-pound increase is a reflection of this athlete’s dedication and commitment to his craft.
We measure athletes’ absolute strength using an Isometric Mid-thigh Pull on force plates which allows us to see how much force the athlete is capable of putting into the ground. Weichbrodt pulled 2698 N in his initial assessment, which is slightly above the high school average at 2614.8 N.
In late February, Emmett pulled 3624 N—which is not only above average for what we see in our college athletes but also slightly above the average we see from our minor league athletes at 3434.8 N. During his latest retest, we saw a slight drop in his absolute strength, which is not ideal but can be somewhat expected after a power-focused block of training.
The next portion of the strength assessment we use our countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) to measure lower body power. The graphs below show Emmett’s results and how they compare to the college athletes we’ve tested in the gym.
In-gym averages for college athletes performing the CMJ and SJ are 41.2 cm and 36.7 respectively. Emmett’s CMJ went from 33.5 cm in late November to early 42.3 cm in early April. His SJ went from 31.8 cm in November to 36.8 cm in April. We also saw a corresponding significant increase in his peak power for both jump types.
The last test in our assessment is the repetitive hop test (RHS) which gives us athletes their respective reactive strength index (RSI) which approximates elasticity and stiffness by dividing the flight time of the jumps by their ground contact time. The in-gym college average for our RSI test is 2.5. When Emmett first got to Driveline his initial RSI test he scored a 2.2, which has since increased to 2.9
The graph below gives perspective to the importance of strength and power in generating bat speed and velocity. The graph represents IMTP net peak force and SJ peak power. Emmett started in the bottom left quadrant of the graph (low force and low power). Ideally, we would like him to progress to the top right quadrant (high force and high power), where the average bat speed is 73.1 for in gym college athletes.
Right now, Emmett is sitting in the top left quadrant (high force, low power) and the average bat speed is 68.6. Emmett’s name is above the dots on the graph and gives you an idea of how close he is to the top right quadrant. Remember, this is a sophomore in high school being compared to college athletes. In most cases, the stronger and more powerful athletes get the faster their bat speed gets.
Each of the dots on the graph represents an athlete and where they fall on the bell curves of strength and power. As we go from bottom left to top right, we generally see the dots turn from blue to red. The blue dots represent athletes that have below seventy miles per hour (MPH) bat speed and the red dots represent athletes that have seventy-five MPH and up on bat speed. As you can see, Emmett has seen steady improvements in strength and power since he first got here, and is climbing up into the top right quadrant of this graph.
For more information about our driveline high performance assessment, check out this blog and subsequent blogs going in-depth about all the tests, how they are performed, and why we use these tests to assess athletes.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
When we look at the hitting side of things, Emmett’s hard work in the weight room paid huge dividends towards his development as a hitter.
Below is a rolling graph of Emmett’s average bat speed during his six months at Driveline – November to April. The solid middle line is his rolling average, and the dotted lines above and below are the standard deviation bounds. What we see here is a pretty steady increase the entire time—ideal…to say the least!
When we compare his average bat speed during his assessment week (64.23mph) against the average from his last two weeks at Driveline (67.17mph), Emmett saw an increase of +2.94mph on his average bat speed, quite the improvement!
His dedication to the weight room and his consistency in the cages paved the way for Emmett to make some huge gains.
When we evaluate exit velocity, our go-to metric is top 8th exit velocity, which is the mean of a hitter’s top 12.5% hardest-hit balls. Comparing his assessment week to his last month in-gym, Emmett added +6.79 mph to his top 8th exit velocity!
With the strength and hitting improvements he made at Driveline, we are very excited to follow along with Emmett as he tears it up during his spring and summer seasons!
Check out how hitting Plyo Ball ®, or weighted hitting balls, can help hitters train bat speed and exit velocity.

Sleep Environment and Hygiene: A Deeper Dive - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-16T00:00:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/sleep-environment-and-hygiene-a-deeper-dive/,"Last time on our Basics of Recovery blog, we detailed the effects of sleep, nutrition, stress management, and active recovery on athletic performance. If you haven’t checked it out yet, it provides foundational information on the importance of sleep and lays the groundwork for this blog’s topic: sleep environment and hygiene.
Sleep environment is the physical space where sleeping occurs and sleep hygiene refers to sleep-centered habits that can improve sleep quantity, sleep quality, and latency (how long it takes to fall asleep). To improve sleep and enhance performance, it is essential to optimize both of these.
To get quality sleep, it is important to create a sleep environment conducive to recovery. First, the bedroom must be as dark as possible. Research suggests that light experienced even through closed eyelids can suppress the brain’s production of melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle known as the circadian rhythm. If possible, hanging blackout curtains over windows can greatly reduce ambient light in the sleeping environment. If hanging curtains is not possible, wearing a sleep mask is also a viable option.
It’s important to consider the temperature of the room for optimizing your sleep environment. It is recommended to keep the bedroom slightly cooler than room temperature, using bedding such as blankets to maintain body heat. If ideal is not possible, it is better to err on the cooler side, as higher temperatures cause increased wakefulness and decreased Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) cycle times. For more information on sleep cycles, check out this Sleep Foundation Article.
Another important aspect of a quality sleep environment is noise. Noise from roommates, outside transportation and other factors can significantly decrease the amount of REM and SWS sleep cycle times. Soundproofing your room or wearing a pair of comfortable earplugs to bed can help reduce the amount of ambient noise in your sleep environment and help you get more quality sleep.
Lastly, keeping your sleeping environment clean and fresh-smelling, especially when it comes to your bedding, can help prevent buildup of dust mites and other issues that may reduce air quality and prevent quality sleep. It is recommended to wash bedding such as pillowcases and sheets once per week.
Improving nutrition and substance intake before bed can also improve sleep quality. Limiting alcohol consumption both chronically and acutely is important for getting quality sleep and recovering from training.
A study on acute alcohol use and sleep using Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a commonly-used metric to measure the balance of the autonomic nervous system between sympathetic and parasympathetic states, found:
It has also been proven that alcohol consumption depresses both REM and SWS sleep cycle times, lowering overall sleep quality.
It is also important to limit the use of caffeine to at least 6 hours before bedtime, due to the well-researched sleep-disrupting effects of caffeine and other stimulants. As far as supplementing to improve sleep, supplementing with magnesium is a very well-researched method of improving sleep quality and duration, as well as increasing melatonin production. Many of the members of the Driveline High Performance staff supplement with magnesium nightly.
Lastly, improving your bedtime routine can also help optimize sleep. First and foremost, adhering to a sleep schedule can both increase sleep quality and reduce latency (how long it takes to fall asleep). Falling asleep and waking up at close to the same times every night will allow the circadian rhythm to efficiently regulate the sleep-wake cycle at the right times, allowing you to fall asleep faster and sleep better, as well as to wake up more refreshed. Additionally, refraining from activities such as watching television, scrolling through social media, playing video games and engaging with other media that will put you in a sympathetic nervous system state before bed is recommended.
Unfortunately, a significant percentage of the population uses media as a sleep aid, despite the fact that it is proven to lower quality of sleep. An easy way to reinforce this habit is to keep electronics out of the bedroom entirely, charging electronics in a separate room.
It is also important to limit exposure to blue light produced by screens in the hours before sleep. Studies show that two-hour exposures to blue light before bed suppress melatonin production in the brain. It is recommended to limit exposure to blue light at least three hours before bed. If using technology before bed is unavoidable, wearing blue light blocking glasses in the hours before bed is a very effective and affordable method.

Predicted Velocity Through Jump and Strength Testing - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-04T00:31:08+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/predicted-pitch-velocity/,"As we’ve collected data through our force plate strength assessment, trainees commonly ask exactly how those physical qualities show up in their sport skill (hitting or pitching). Examining how high performance metrics from our force plate assessment directionally relates with skill outcomes is a strong area of interest for us and we wanted to go beyond correlational analyses and build out our own in-house predictive models.
Our High Performance R&D Intern, Anthony Osnacz, did just this, using our force plate data to investigate how the physical qualities measured in our jump and strength assessments show up on the mound or in the batter’s box. The current model we use to predict pitch velocity—this specific piece talks about using force plate metrics to predict a pitcher’s fastball velocity; position players’ data is used to predict bat speed—from our force plate assessments takes physical qualities in a vacuum—absent any skill, intent, readiness, or any of the many other factors important for a pitcher.
Our in-house models are not intended to tell us, “If you have x force plate metrics, you will throw y velocity.” Rather, they say, “If you have x force plate metrics, we would expect you to throw y velocity, with all other variables equal.” This allows trainers to quickly determine whether an athlete’s actual mound results are out-or underperforming their predicted fastball velocities, therefore allowing us to quickly identify and communicate lowest hanging fruit for a pitcher’s training.
Athletes A and B (velocities shown in table below) have a similar predicted fastball velocity from their force plate profiles, but their actual motion capture tests are 16 mph apart. This helps demonstrate how two similar force plate tests can result in different training recommendations.
The typical interpretation for Athlete A’s mound velocity outperforming his predicted velocity was that his throwing skill was outperforming his general physical qualities, and with that in mind his lowest hanging fruit this offseason was improving the physical areas he lacked the most. This meant allocating more of his training economy to building strength and power in the weight room and less training economy to specific throwing work.
Athlete B is in essentially the opposite situation, with his mocap velocity underperforming his predicted velocity. Typically, an athlete in this situation needs a focus on the skill side, so this offseason he had throwing work emphasized, with reduced volume in the weight room reflected in his training economy balance.
In the past we’ve implemented ordinary least squares regression models to predict throwing velocity off of force plate metrics, but now with a larger sample size we decided to re-run the analysis using some different methods.
We split the data 75/25 into training and test datasets respectively, then we trained a few multi-linear regression models. After an examination of relevant feature impact, multicollinearity, and error diagnostics/residual behavior (among other factors), we settled on a model with a 2.7 MAE (mean absolute error; in other words, on average the model was +/- 2.7 mph off of an athlete’s actual average velocity) and R^2 of 0.54.
The metrics that are weighted the heaviest in the model are Squat Jump Peak Power (W), RSI-modified (m/s) from the Countermovement Jump, the Reactive Strength Index (Flight Time / Ground Contact Time) recorded during the Hop Test, and Net Peak Force (N) from the Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull. All the aforementioned independent variables shared a Variance Inflation Factor under 5, which was an encouraging sign towards managing multicollinearity. Current limitations of the model include not accounting for anatomical differences such as limb length and not having any information on an athlete’s upper body strength or power.

The Basics of Recovery for Athletic Performance - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-25T01:06:13+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/the-basics-of-recovery-for-athletic-performance/,"When people think about what it takes to get bigger, stronger, or faster, they often only think about what happens in the weight room. In actuality, training in the gym breaks the body down, while the period of recovery afterwards is what builds the body back up.
You get bigger, stronger, and faster by recovering from that training. This process is called “supercompensation”. This can also be visualized in the image above.
When talking about recovery, it is important to note the role of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for increasing heart rate, blood flow and alertness. The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for reducing heart rate and digestion, and conserving energy.
Dr. Mike T. Nelson puts it well when he says to “think of [the] parasympathetic like your brakes and [the] sympathetic as your gas pedal.” Both parts of the autonomic nervous system play vital roles in an athlete’s performance. In this article we are going to focus primarily on activating the parasympathetic nervous system to allow for better recovery.
Quality and quantity of sleep are essential for athlete performance and recovery. Lack of sleep is shown to have negative effects on almost every area of performance, including reaction times, cognitive ability, and injury rates. Both acute and chronic sleep deprivation have large negative effects on performance. Acute sleep deprivation is getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep in a given night, and chronic sleep deprivation is not getting enough sleep for extended periods.
Every individual has different needs, but it is generally recommended to get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night to recover from the stresses of training. Making positive changes in sleep quantity and quality also has a strong correlation with increased testosterone and an improved immune system. In a study of 10 young men whose sleep was restricted from eight hours a night to five, daytime testosterone levels decreased by 10 to 15 percent.
Sleep hygiene refers to sleep-centered habits that can improve sleep quantity, sleep quality, and latency (how long it takes to fall asleep). The first recommendation for improving sleep hygiene is to create a quality sleep environment. In order to do this, make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. A popular way to ensure this is to hang blackout curtains and wear earplugs. Also, you might refrain from eating, relaxing, or studying in the bedroom, as it should be a place used exclusively for sleep.
The next recommendation for improving sleep hygiene is to go to sleep and wake up at similar times on a consistent basis. This is important because the human body has a circadian rhythm that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Adhering to a sleep schedule that allows your brain to release melatonin (the sleep hormone) at the same times every night will greatly improve sleep quality.
Another recommendation is to reduce blue light exposure in the hours before sleep. Blue light emitted by screens such as phones, computers, and televisions can impair the brain’s ability to produce melatonin. If using a screen before bedtime is unavoidable, purchasing an affordable pair of blue light reduction glasses and wearing them in the hours before bed is a viable option. The last simple recommendation to improve sleep quality is to limit caffeine and other stimulant consumption to early in the day, as the use of stimulants like caffeine close to bedtime can impair sleep.
Proper nutrition is also vital to an athlete’s recovery from training. It is important to ensure that you are eating enough calories to meet your bodyweight, body composition, and athletic goals, no matter the time of year.  We won’t dive into the nitty gritty of nutrition in this article, but we will go over some of the basics to make sure you are recovering the best way possible. A few of our strength coaches have found the Renaissance Periodization EBook useful as a more comprehensive guide to nutrition. You could also  check out Andy Galpin’s research on nutrition for athletes.
We commonly see athletes not eat the right amount of calories to meet their goals. This can go both ways, as both over- and under-eating are non-conducive to fitness and performance goals. There are a multitude of factors that go into the correct calorie balance for an individual, but in general if you want to lose weight you should be in a calorie deficit, and if you want to gain weight you should be in a calorie surplus.
When athletes ask how many calories they should be eating, we typically consider a few different factors. If they have already been tracking their calories using an app such as MyFitnessPal, then we can check their average caloric intake and add or subtract from there. If they haven’t been tracking their calories, we will typically have them download MyFitnessPal, and then we will tell them to eat normally and track everything they eat or drink for 4-5 days. From there, we will sit down with them again and see how many calories they’ve been averaging while eating like they normally do.
Unless altering body composition is the athlete’s main goal for the training block, most athletes typically need to primarily focus on calorie and protein intake. Depending on numerous factors such as eating habits, body composition, goals and more, protein intake at 1.6-1.8g/kg of bodyweight should be sufficient for most athletes.
When speaking of controlling stress in regards to training, most people exclusively think of the physical stress of the training itself. The truth is that physical, mental, and emotional stress all affect the body’s ability to recover and grow. The nervous system and endocrine system cannot tell the difference between physical, emotional, and mental stress.
An example of this would be a person feeling exhausted after a taxing emotional ordeal such as an argument with a partner. When exposed to stressors, the body transitions into a sympathetic nervous system state, also known as fight or flight. In this state, the hormones cortisol and adrenaline are increased. Short term, these effects are normal and healthy. However, being chronically stuck in a sympathetic nervous system state makes recovering from stress difficult.
One of the most important steps in managing stressors is to take an objective look at what in life is actually a stressor. Many people think they are “relaxing” when watching sports, watching television, or playing video games. The truth is their heart rate is likely elevated and they are in a sympathetic nervous system state—which means they are not recovering or relaxing during this time. This is not to say that activities outside of training that act as stressors must be completely removed, but it is important to be aware of them and to make an effort to limit their impact. Another important step to managing stress outside of training is learning stress management techniques to use in your daily life.
An established method of returning to a parasympathetic nervous system state is meditating or doing some form of breathwork. There are many techniques for meditation and breathing, and almost all of them are in some way effective at putting the nervous system in a state to recover. Additionally, learning conflict resolution techniques that allow for less unneeded stress in one’s daily life can massively reduce the amount of mental and emotional stress accumulated outside of training.
Baseball players have historically been told to do flush runs post throwing to remove the lactic acid from their arm. The soreness that many associate with lactic acid is the result of the massive stretch shortening cycle that the arm goes through in the delivery, along with the eccentric forces that throwing exerts on the body.
The goal for active recovery on recovery days should be to stimulate blood flow and restore range of motion. Great choices for active recovery on rest days can include anything that’s low stress and low impact. A few examples include movement circuits, walks, meditation, tempo runs and targeted soft tissue work. The main goal for these days is to avoid activities that will bring you back into a sympathetic state and inhibit your recovery.

Interpreting Force Plate Data for Athlete Programming - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-09T00:24:55+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/interpreting-force-plate-data-for-athlete-programming/,"In the assessment summary blog, we used the analogy of filling buckets to explain how we apply force plate data in programming. Using our normative data to compare an athlete’s data to age/level of play specific averages while also taking into account the context of competition phase, training history, athlete goals, etc., we can accurately determine athlete needs.
Rather than speak generally, in this blog we will walk through the assessment process and program implementation for a specific athlete.
In the images below we can see Cole Uvila’s initial strength assessment data, ranging from his assessment in September 2020 to February 2021. The white line perpendicular to the bars is our pro average, with the dashed red lines marking a standard deviation above and below average. Looking at his strength and power metrics, we can see he was initially below average in all four metrics relative to our minor league normative data. This suggests Cole was fairly balanced heading into the offseason, with slightly larger deficiencies in absolute strength as shown in the IMTP, and reactive strength as seen in the hop test.
Next, we look at these needs in the context of the athlete’s phase of competition, as well as other factors specific to the athlete. Cole’s next competition will be in 2021 Spring Training, giving us roughly five training blocks (6 week each) together until he will be throwing in games.
When building out the athlete’s annual training plan, the time of year informs us on how to best structure their current phase for both long term development and preparation for competition. Generally, the closer an athlete is to competition the more their program will be geared towards preparation. The earlier it is in the offseason, the more we can focus on building new capacity.
Cole came to Driveline in August, giving us plenty of time to address his individual needs.
An athlete’s level of experience with weight training and throwing informs how much on-ramping they may need, as well as instruction in foundational movements.
As a 26-year-old professional athlete who has trained with us for multiple years, we know Cole has an extensive training history in both the weight room and with our throwing training methods. This tells us that any on-ramping he needs will be in terms of volume and intensity rather than in the general lifting skills, experience, etc. that a more inexperienced lifter may need.
Cole’s skill goals going into the 2021 season were to hit 100mph with his fastball and to make the 40-man roster for the Rangers.
Physically, his main goals were to build up his strength base and to improve his body composition, as he had always felt weak relative to teammates and competitors.
Early in the offseason, Cole’s lifting program focused on relatively high volume strength work, working in mostly rep ranges of 5 to 10 reps per set and increasing his time under tension. This accumulation block was designed to help him build some muscle mass and make strength gains; this corresponded with a lower high intensity throwing volume so as to balance his overall training economy.
As you can see in the graphics below, through the offseason he saw a very small change in body weight and a very large change in relative strength (IMTP Net PF divided by BW). Along with visually observable changes in his body composition, an increase of this magnitude in relative strength without a significant change in body weight often indicates an improved body composition, as the athlete is exerting significantly more force with relatively similar body mass.
Cole’s focus has shifted over the offseason, with reduced weight room volume and increasing high intensity throwing volume, and now that he is approaching competition his weight room focus will largely shift to power development and xpxlyometricxx work so as to develop and prepare the systems he’ll need in games this season.
As shown in the previous graph of his IMTP Net Peak Force, Cole’s IMTP NPF has increased steadily over the last three training blocks, with an average gain of about 500N per block. This magnitude is atypical for the average trainee, but the trend of development and the layout of his offseason plan is relatively common for our pro arms.
Overall, our procedure is the same as before we had force plates. We begin by determining athlete needs and goals, and then plan and execute a plan to address and achieve those while regularly monitoring progress. The biggest advantage the force plates provide in programming is the specificity and accuracy of the information we have when determining needs and measuring progress.

Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull (IMTP) Strength Testing - Driveline Baseball,2020-12-03T07:45:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/12/isometric-mid-thigh-pull-imtp-strength-testing/,"If you haven’t read our High Performance assessment summary blog, it is a good place to start.
The Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull (IMTP) is a form of Multi-Joint Isometric Test (MJIT) and is useful for assessing athletes because of its safety, ease of application, and data quality.
The IMTP is performed on a dual force plate system with a barbell locked at mid-thigh height, with the athlete attempting to produce as much force as possible as quickly as possible.
MJITs have shown less injury risk than traditional 1RM testing often implemented in strength assessments/reassessments. With the IMTP requiring less experience and lifting-skill to execute at maximum effort than a 1RM test, it is safer than loading up a back squat—especially for an athlete’s initial strength assessment when we have limited knowledge of their experience and capability.
The IMTP also shows limited benefit from familiarization, meaning that after the initial warm-up reps, the results show low variance between sessions. This is important because we want to test an athlete’s strength, not their technical competency at performing the test, making it practical for assessing an athlete of any experience level and evaluating athlete progress over extended periods of time. With the IMTP, we can be confident that a change in result is due to a change in strength, not due to a change in IMTP technique.
Research also shows that the IMTP is an accurate means of determining key metrics, including peak force, peak force relative to body weight, and force at specific times (such as 150, 200, 250, and 300 ms). This gives us information about the athlete’s maximal strength capacity and their rate of force development profile.
The IMTP’s effectiveness is heavily dependent on controlling as many variables outside the athlete’s change in strength as possible. Measuring key joint angles is an important first step, after which any subsequent testing is performed at the same bar height. We use 125° for the knee and 150° for the hip because these angles provide a strong and well-leveraged position for the knee, with the hip angle set to ensure an upright torso.
An upright torso is important for the IMTP because it allows for maximum force production and ensures that the lower body force production is not significantly limited by erector or trapezius strength. Removing potential limiters is also why we make use of figure-8 straps fixed to our IMTP bar. Grip strength has been shown to be a significant limiter to the IMTP PF, so using straps or an alternating grip is recommended.
We instruct the athlete to start with as little tension in the bar as possible because any tension can lead to an unsteady baseline or contribute to a counter-movement at the trial’s onset, which are both grounds for trial rejection. Both conditions alter RFD readouts from the test, and a counter-movement at the beginning of the rep is a significant issue because it allows the athlete to tap into the stretch-shortening cycle, which will help them generate more PF and produce higher RFD.
We also discard reps showing PF achieved at the very end of the effort because it indicates a yank action and a break in technique, not a true reading of their IMTP PF.
Net Peak Force (Net PF) is the first metric we look at from the IMTP. To calculate Net PF, we subtract bodyweight from PF. We use Net PF instead of Peak Force to more accurately compare between athletes and between retests, so that athlete weight differences or weight fluctuation do not skew any comparison. Net PF is used to gauge absolute strength and compare results to our facility average for a given athlete’s competition level.
Dividing Net PF by bodyweight gives a relative strength value—a good indicator if a person is strong relative to their body weight. We look to see PF over three times body weight. This metric is especially useful for athletes in a body-composition phase, either looking to gain weight or lose it. An athlete looking to add some muscle, for example, would want to see their relative peak force stay the same or increase because this means that their increased weight came with an increase in force production.
An overweight athlete may display high levels of absolute force but still have low relative strength because of the excess body fat they are carrying. If the athlete can minimize the strength lost during a body-composition phase, their relative strength should improve significantly.
Rate of Force Development (RFD) can be a ‘noisy’ metric with a lot of variability from rep to rep, making it impractical for S&C practitioners as a direct measure of an athlete’s ability to produce force rapidly. Instead, we recommend using Net Force in early time intervals following the onset of the pull because it is more reliable and can be used as a proxy for RFD. If we take the Net Force at 50 ms intervals from 100 to 250 ms (e.g., @ 100-, 150-, 200-, 250 ms), we can still determine how quickly an athlete can increase force output without measuring RFD directly.
You may ask why RFD measures tend to be “noisy” and/or unreliable. The cause of error is that when RFD is calculated at points of the rep, it is taking the slope of the Force-Time curve, which is not always smooth, and the slight spikes and dips in the curve (as shown in the figure above) could lead to drastically altered RFD readings if RFD is calculated at the uneven points.
To take force at certain points one step farther, we can take the Net Force at these different points as a percentage of Net PF to compare RFD across trials or athletes. In the table and graph below, example athlete data shows how this could be visualized:
Looking at the data and graph, we can see that Athlete 1 has the highest RFD, which allows them to reach as much force in the first 250ms as either of the other two, despite a significantly lower Peak Net Force total. This could help us see more deeply into an athlete’s force production capability and give us more data to compare to pitcher/hitter performance.
When it comes to using IMTP data to program for an athlete, we compare their Net PF to the mean for their level of competition per our facility data and generally look for a Net PF greater than 3000N.
An athlete who tests low in the IMTP demonstrates low absolute strength, so they will typically need a strength-focused training phase for their next block. If the athlete shows good absolute strength, we will look to the other parts of their strength assessment to get an accurate picture of their needs.
For example, if an athlete tests above 3000N in the IMTP but jumps a below average jump height in the countermovement jump, they may need a power-focused training phase. These are general standards for our IMTP data interpretation. Other factors, such as athlete age, training experience, off-season stage, health, etc., must also be considered when building the athlete’s strength program.

What is the 10 to 5 Repeated Hop Test? - Driveline Baseball,2020-12-02T10:14:13+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/12/what-is-the-10-to-5-repeated-hop-test/,"If you haven’t read our High Performance assessment summary blog, it is a good place to start.
The repeated hop test is an assessment in which an athlete hops a predetermined number of times—often five or ten—consecutively, with the goal of maximizing the ratio of their flight time to ground contact time.
Flight time divided by ground contact time is referred to as reactive strength index (RSI) and is a measure of an athlete’s ability to quickly produce force under high eccentric load. While we use the hop test mainly to measure reactive strength, there are other metrics that can be useful to look at in some scenarios that fall outside the scope of this article.
We’ll focus on the uses of the repeated hop test here.
We perform the test using the 10 to 5 method. This is a variation test in which the athlete performs ten jumps, and only the top five jumps are accepted in the test results. The protocol of eliminating the lower scoring reps was put in place because often those jumps produce lower RSI due to deficiencies in posture rather than in the properties that we are trying to measure[1].
Some RSI tests do not remove any scores, but the removal of the lower scoring reps was “deemed reliable for determining RSI for male, female, and pooled male and female cohorts”[2]. As with any test implemented in the assessment process, we need it to meet a high standard of reliability for comparison between trials as we test and retest and compare athletes to their peers.
The test has also shown slim benefits of familiarization after the first rep, with an 11.55% change between trials 1 and 2, and only a maximum between-trial change of 1.25% in trials 2-5[3]. This familiarization benefit is a big part of why we perform two trials of the test. The data gives us confidence that we are getting enough reps to accurately measure RSI without over-fatiguing the athlete. This is also why we perform three trials, ensuring that no data pre-familiarization is accepted.
The RSI metric is also not very sensitive to athlete fatigue. In a 27-week study in which training volume was varied throughout, there were only 3 weeks out of the 27 in which RSI results deviated significantly[4]. This shows that the test is not heavily impacted by the athlete’s fatigue level, which is important for assessment implementation. We want to trust that the data is not skewed by fatigue.
We do the test with hands-on-hips to avoid any deviation between trials or athletes resulting from upper body movements.
As stated earlier, RSI is a measure of an athlete’s ability to quickly produce force under high eccentric load; being able to quickly and effectively go through the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) is a major component for dynamic athletes. Because RSI is dependent on eccentric stimulus to begin the SSC, we do not expect to see strong correlations to concentric-only actions.
This is seen in a study setting with correlations between RSI and athlete acceleration ability being lower than the correlation between RSI and a measure of maximal speed[5]. The study found a significant negative correlation between RSI and flying 10m sprint times (r=-0.62), meaning that RSI was relevant to top-end sprint speed capacity. The study also found that maximal speed sprinting showed lower ground contact times than the acceleration phase of sprints, making the qualities of lower-body stiffness and the ability to quickly harness elastic energy extremely important, both of which contribute to measures of RSI.
The ability to efficiently use the SSC as measured by the hop test transfers to movements that use a quick eccentric load, such as sprinting, bounding, and changing direction. Hopping and sprinting are examples of a quick SSC, and a countermovement jump is an example of a slower SSC. These dynamic movements are more common tasks that make use of the SSC, but we can also see why it may be relevant to more niche sport demands such as a pitcher’s lead leg striking the ground with great force and needing to quickly and efficiently transfer that force up through the body.
When it comes to interpreting the data from an athlete’s hop test, we evaluate their results compared to the levels in Table 1. A healthy athlete who tests with a low RSI lacks the ability to dynamically use high eccentric loads to output high concentric forces, so we will generally include a xpxlyometricxx progression in their next training block to develop those qualities.
Generally, athletes who test below a 2.0 in RSI receive a beginner xpxlyometricxx program with relatively simple movements and those above 2.0 start with an intermediate level progression.
Other variables such as athlete age, health, and training experience also play a role in their xpxlyometricxx program level, and all athletes must complete the intermediate level as a prerequisite to the advanced progression to ensure they have built a system robust enough to benefit from more complicated or stressful movements.

What is the Squat Jump Test and why use it? - Driveline Baseball,2020-12-01T12:21:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/12/what-is-the-squat-jump-test-and-why-use-it/,"If you haven’t read our High Performance assessment summary blog, it is a good place to start.
The Squat Jump (SJ) test is used to assess lower-body concentric power. Squat Jumps are specific to strength and explosive sport competition, as many actions start in a static position (Haun, 2015). Removing the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) from the jump test helps us better understand an athlete’s ability to overcome inertia from a still starting position.
The Squat Jump is important to include in conjunction with the Countermovement Jump (CMJ) test because the Squat Jump test is more sensitive to fatigue levels. The CMJ can “mask” lower extremity force production due to the utilization of the SSC. (Haun, 2015). Testing athletes, both with and without the SSC, gives us a broader picture of their current physical properties and what they may need to work on moving forward.
The variables analyzed in our Squat Jump test are:
The current protocol for testing an athlete in the Driveline Squat Jump goes as follows:
We aim to get four acceptable trials from each athlete’s Squat Jump test. Unacceptable readings occur if:
Figure 1 is an example force trace of an athlete performing the Squat Jump.
Prior to takeoff is the quiet phase. This is where the athlete squats down to 90​ degrees​ and holds the bottom position for three seconds. The significant markers of the SJ are in the following points:
You can also observe that lines are representing each leg and total force throughout the jump. Orange is the right leg, blue is the left leg, and the grey line is the total amount of force between the left and the right legs.
Another highlight of the SJ test is in identifying athlete lower-body asymmetries. Assessing asymmetries during a squat jump can help identify imbalances or other potential issues that a strength coach may want to address in the athlete’s programming. It’s not unusual for athletes to display small asymmetries in their jumping patterns—especially considering that baseball is a rotational sport where athletes are frequently rotating in one direction over-and-over again.
Therefore, some level of asymmetry is expected, and in fact, normal – some slight asymmetries may be functional adaptations that help an athlete perform their skill. We generally want to see asymmetries within 15 percent in jumping patterns. In the figure below, the x-axis represents symmetry between legs, and each line above or below represents an additional 5 percent asymmetry.
Below the axis means the athlete favors their left leg, and above the axis means the athlete is favoring their right leg.
Figure 2 shows the jump asymmetries of two different athletes.
As you can see, both athletes display asymmetries in their jumps. Athlete 1 has very minimal asymmetries, while Athlete 2 has more severe asymmetries and heavily favors his left leg.
Figure 3 shows us a closer look at right and left leg asymmetries in the force trace.
As you can see in this image, the athlete is putting more force into their left leg (blue) than they are on the right leg (orange).
Using force plates to assess the Squat Jump can provide us with a number of insights that we can leverage to create better programs for our athletes. For example, a study by Nagahara et al. 2014 found that the squat jump had a significant correlation to the acceleration phase (6th to 10th steps) of sprinting, conceivably because concentric strength and power is a significant factor contributing to acceleration.
Therefore, an athlete who scores poorly in the squat jump may benefit from concentric strength & power training. However, it also important to consider other factors – such as an athlete’s body composition. If an athlete carries too much body fat, improving body composition may yield greater improvements to jump height and sprint speeds than a program focused on concentric strength and power qualities.
For a second example, we can compare an athlete’s squat jump height to their countermovement jump height. This is known as the Eccentric Utilization Ratio (EUR) and is calculated by dividing countermovement jump height by squat jump height (CMJ / SJ = EUR).
If an athlete’s jump squat jump height is significantly lower than their countermovement jump height, that is theoretically a strong indication that the athlete is highly reliant on the stretch-shortening cycle to produce explosive movement and may be lacking concentric strength and/or power. Therefore, it may be sensible to bias training to include lifts that develop these qualities.
An Olympic lifting variation where the athlete pulls from the floor or blocks may be preferable to a hang clean or hang snatch. A trap bar deadlift may make more sense than an RDL. A non-countermovement box jump may be better than a regular box jump. As a general rule of thumb, we would like to see athletes jump 10 to 20 percent higher in a countermovement jump compared to the squat jump – a EUR of 1.1-1.2. If the gap between the two is much higher than 20 percent, it may indicate that the athlete could benefit from more concentric strength and power training.
Conversely, if the gap between the squat jump and countermovement jump is less than 10 percent, that may indicate that the athlete is not able to harness the elastic energy from a countermovement to assist in the concentric phase of a jump. Here, the exercise prescription would skew towards drills that build eccentric strength and/or make use of the stretch reflex. Trap bar jumps would be done from a standing position rather than starting from the floor or blocks. The hang cleans and hang snatch would be preferred over Olympic variations that start from the bottom position. Depth jumps and other plyometrics could be used to enhance the stretch reflex.
EUR assumes that the only difference between the CMJ and SJ is the presence of the countermovement, which is not always the case, as there are some confounding variables that must be considered when comparing the two jumps. Any change in technique or setup can influence jump results, but some of the most common examples of this are differences in countermovement depth—an athlete reaching a different depth in their CMJ than their starting position in the SJ, and the width of the athlete’s feet at the start of the jump—some athletes will widen their stance to reach the 90-degree knee angle.
Therefore, it’s important not to make programming decisions in a vacuum. Instead, we want to factor in information from all of our assessments to give us more context before making any programming decisions. With that said, the 10 to 20 percent gap between an athlete’s squat jump and countermovement jump can be used as a general guideline, as long as the context of the other variables is always considered.
Both the squat jump and the countermovement jump can be used to assess left/right asymmetries, which can inform programming decisions. The practical application of assessing asymmetries is covered in the Countermovement Jump section of this blog series.

What is the Countermovement Jump (CMJ) Test? - Driveline Baseball,2020-11-26T05:17:21+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/11/what-is-the-counter-movement-jump-cmj-test/,"If you haven’t read our High Performance assessment summary blog, it is a good place to start.
The Countermovement Jump (CMJ) is a vertical jump test performed by having an athlete quickly squat to a self-selected depth and then jump as high as possible. It is the first jump in our force plate assessment and is used to both determine lower body power via jump height and to measure lower limb asymmetries.
A CMJ can be performed with the athlete’s natural arm swing or with hands placed on hips. We use hands on hips because every athlete can generate a different amount of power from their arm swing, making comparison between athletes less reliable with an arm swing [1].
An efficient arm swing can have a significant impact on jump height when compared to an inefficient arm swing, so by using the hands-on-hips variation, we eliminate differences in jump performance that are strictly due to arm swing, thus giving us a more precise representation of lower body power.
When it comes to measuring jump performance on a dual force plate system, the most common strategies are to estimate jump height using either flight time or using a calculation based on the athlete’s change in momentum (imMotus) to estimate their center of mass displacement.
One flaw in using flight time to estimate jump performance is that a jumper often will not land in the same body position that they left the ground in, causing flight time to overestimate their center of mass displacement if they land in any posture other than their upright takeoff position [2]. The imMotus-momentum method’s main source of error comes from imprecise measurement of the athlete’s weight, which is easily avoided by frequently calibrating the platform in order to minimize drift and by ensuring that the athlete stands still while being weighed.
In an assessment setting, we want to make sure we are getting an accurate evaluation of an athlete’s relevant capabilities, which is why our CMJ assessment is performed with hands-on-hips and measured using imMotus-momentum estimated jump height.
Monitoring asymmetries in lower limbs is another application of the CMJ. Athletes who demonstrate >15% eccentric asymmetry have been linked to higher risk of lower body injury, but measuring asymmetries isn’t necessarily about injury prediction—it is mainly used to improve programming and as a framework for monitoring both the general athlete population and those undergoing return-to-play protocols [3].
Force plate researcher Matt Jordan found that athletes with relatively clean lower body injury history showed no significant asymmetry patterns over time, while those with ACL injury history exhibited a pattern in their asymmetries, along with a higher degree of asymmetry.
These patterns showed an athlete consistently favoring the same leg during the same phases of the jump across multiple trials.  Not every athlete with ACL injury history displayed the same asymmetry patterns, but the presence of any pattern within one athlete’s trials was well correlated with injury history [3].
Athlete 1: Has a tight right hip from a previous injury, causing them to have trouble squatting into their right side, resulting in them favoring their left side in the eccentric portion of the jump.
Athlete 2: Favors the left leg due to a previous right-side ACL injury.
Percentage-wise, both athletes could show the same results with significantly different underlying causes. This is why it is important to understand the context behind asymmetry index percentages.
Another reason to look beyond the percentage readout: a study testing athlete lower limb asymmetry in the CMJ, Squat Jump, Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull, and Drop Jump Tests found that asymmetries were task-dependent [4]. Considering this alongside the demands of on-field tasks, instead of predicting injury the CMJ asymmetry results tell us to investigate the causes that could impact the athlete’s health and performance.
When it comes to interpreting an athlete’s force plate assessment data for the CMJ, we start by looking at the outcome measures—jump height and asymmetries in various phases of the jump.
This gives us a surface level understanding of the athlete’s lower body power capabilities and allows us to identify potential red flags in their movement strategy. However, when necessary we can dive deeper—looking at eccentric & concentric contraction times, countermovement depth, lower limb stiffness, RSI-mod, and other metrics that provide more information about how the athlete produced the outcome measures.
Jump height is compared to our facility data, normed specifically to their level of play (high school, college, MiLB, etc.), and used along with their squat jumps, hop test, and isometric mid-thigh pull results to inform their next phase of strength programming.
Asymmetries are expected, and may even be advantageous—for example a pitcher developing greater external rotation in their throwing shoulder. However, anecdotally, we’ve found that high asymmetries greater than 20-25% generally indicate an existing injury or evidence of a past injury, where the athlete may not have recovered full function of the affected limb. Some studies have shown increased injury occurrence in athletes displaying asymmetries greater than 15% [3].
Therefore, we will typically intervene with targeted strength programming when we see a consistent pattern of asymmetries that approaches 15% or higher. Some ways that we address asymmetries is to substitute more single leg and unilateral strength exercises (e.g. reverse lunges & single-leg RDLs) for bilateral lifts (eg. squats & deadlifts) in order to ensure that each limb is receiving the appropriate training stimulus in each training session. We can also target specific phases of movement; if an athlete has a pronounced asymmetry in the eccentric deceleration phase of their CMJ, we can target deceleration patterns and eccentric strength with our programming to build those capacities in the affected limb.
We also look at the force trace resulting from the jump to provide further context to their test results. Here is an example CMJ force-trace with key stages in the jump highlighted:
Additional things to focus on when looking at a CMJ force-trace are a stable initiation and the right and left leg individual traces. The grey line is the trace of the total force, with orange representing the right side and blue the left side. The individual leg traces can give further context to the asymmetry percentages, helping to inform program adjustments and return to play procedure.
After an athlete completes their force plate assessment, we use the data from their CMJ, squat jump, hop test, and isometric mid-thigh pull together to determine their strength program needs.
The CMJ results can be used in conjunction with the Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull to inform the athlete’s next training block. With the CMJ demonstrating lower body power and the IMTP measuring more absolute strength, the balance between the two gives us a complete picture of their needs.
An athlete who outperforms the average of their competition level in the CMJ but is lacking in IMTP force production may benefit from a strength-focused training phase, while an athlete who demonstrates above-average strength in the IMTP but a below-average jump height might need a power-focused phase for their next block.
We generally build strength first, developing the athlete’s ability to produce high forces, and then add power, increasing the rate at which they can exert those high forces. This is not always the case, with time of season, athlete age, training experience, positional needs, and other factors also influencing what they need. Stage of competition is especially important to consider, and we will typically have athletes that are in a late off-season period do more ballistic work, such sprints and plyometrics, to prepare for competition.
The ratio of the squat jump height to CMJ height tells us how much jump height the athlete gains from the countermovement in the jump. We use CMJ height divided by SJ height to get an eccentric utilization ratio. We look for this to be between 1.1-1.20, or in other words a 10-20% higher CMJ height than SJ height.
An athlete who scores below 1.1 may benefit from exercises that include the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC), such as a countermovement trap bar jump or hang-variation Olympic lifts. For athletes that score >1.2, the opposite focus may be needed, implementing concentric focused lifts like a trap bar jump from the ground or Olympic lifts from the ground.
These are not absolutes as other variables affect jump height in either jump, and variances in an athlete’s jump technique could be more to blame for their score than their usage of the SSC, so it is important to view the 1.1-1.2 window as a guideline and not a rule.
The data from all force plate tests are used to inform athlete programming and measure their progress throughout their training. This data is always taken in the context of their training history, current throwing phase, whether they are in season or not, and a variety of other variables that influence their needs.

High Performance Assessment: Strength Testing Using Force Plates - Driveline Baseball,2020-11-25T06:20:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/11/high-performance-assessment-strength-testing-using-force-plates/,"In a Driveline strength assessment, we test a range of general strength properties using a dual force plate system from ForceDecks.
In the coming days, we will release a series of articles that break down each of our assessments: How do we perform them? What information do we get from them? How does that inform programming?
This introductory article gives a brief overview of our assessment process, providing some context, and setting the stage for the upcoming articles. Our current testing protocol consists of:
It is important to note that while preliminary analysis has shown a moderate positive correlation of several of our assessment metrics to skill outcomes like pitching velocity and exit velocity, when we look at these properties, there is no perfect recipe or formula that we are testing for.
When we look at assessment data, it is with the understanding that beyond the general physical properties we are testing, there are other factors always in play, including individual tissue properties, muscle insertion points, mechanical efficiency, and numerous other qualities that are often athlete-specific.
We typically approach strength training with the metaphor of filling buckets, and the results from an athlete’s assessment show us where to add water:
This athlete would show excellent maximal strength in the IMTP, with average explosive strength and poor reactive ability in the jumps. Their training program would generally focus on explosive work and plyometrics with a maintenance level of heavy lifting, all intended to fill their explosive strength and reactive ability buckets while keeping their maximal strength bucket as full as possible.
We assess each athlete during their first week in the gym and then retest once every 6 weeks. Six-week blocks allow us to track athlete progress to advance programming without using so much training economy that we significantly interfere with their throwing or lifting programs.
Testing is different than monitoring in that testing is performed periodically (eg. every 6 weeks), whereas monitoring is done on an ongoing basis or with very short intervals (eg. at the start of every lift). Both have their benefits and their drawbacks. Testing tends to take significantly longer but the depth of information is often much greater. Monitoring provides less information but because it is done more frequently, you can identify trends and potentially make programming adjustments on a much shorter timeline.
Currently, we monitor athlete response to training using subjective wellness questionnaires, which are given to athletes on a daily basis. Eventually, we may look to add objective measures that allow us to monitor athlete response to training, however, those tend to be more challenging to implement from a logistical standpoint. Inevitably, we will end up with a protocol that consists of both testing and monitoring – testing to get a deep understanding of the athlete, and monitoring to give us useful information that can be used to make adjustments in a tighter time frame.
We chose force plate assessments over alternative methods such as 1RM/3RM/etc. testing because with our in-gym population, it gives us the most bang for our buck. The IMTP is significantly correlated with heavy lower body compound lifts such as a back squat 1RM and shows lower injury risk than 1RM testing. Safety is especially important in our assessment, given the range of ages and training experience within our trainee population. Because an athlete’s initial assessment is likely the first time we have seen them move in the weight room, loading up a back squat or deadlift max is often not the safest move.
This is not to say that there is no value in these tests, as max tests absolutely provide useful information for a performance coach and have the additional benefit of highlighting an athlete’s technique for that particular lift. This is why it is especially important for us to have coaches on the floor during training hours to monitor and coach technique, but this is not a part of our assessment process.
Our assessment process and the specific metrics we look at are continually being evaluated and compared to other possibilities as we collect data and learn to apply it better. As our assessment evolves, we will update this blog series with significant changes or additional tests that may be added down the road.

The impact of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) on baseball players,2020-03-22T04:30:20+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/03/the-impact-of-the-autonomic-nervous-system-on-baseball-players/,"At some point in their careers, many baseball players have to spend time under the care of a medical provider.
What we tell athletes under that care can have long term psychological effects that present themselves in physical manifestations.
Traditionally, the standard of care has been to identify areas on the body that are not moving optimally, assign blame to those areas as the reason an athlete got hurt, and then “fix” those areas.
In a short-sighted way, this makes perfect sense, and this model has helped many athletes.
However, the psychological impact this can have on a person is often ignored—and it is an impact that is often more severe for an athlete trying to allow their body to perform at peak levels.
I recently worked with an athlete who had been to physical therapy on and off for the last several years with multiple lumbar stress fractures. He was always diligent about completing his home exercise program and listened to his doctor’s instructions.
For much of his high school life, this athlete was told that he kept getting injured because of weakness in his core and hips, along with having poor thoracic flexibility. His fracture has now been healed for some time, yet he is still having pain with baseball activities.
During his exam, he demonstrated good mobility with some remaining weaknesses. When he discussed what he is doing at home, he explained the exercises doctors gave him in the past.
I asked him how often he is thinking about protecting his spine. He replied, “Pretty much all the time”.
At that point, I talked to him about how his fracture had healed and explained that any future core strengthening should come from his strength program.
We began weaning him off the exercises that were part of his normal “spine care” routine, and after a few visits his strength was back to normal and his pain was significantly reduced.
Injuries are much more complex than “this body part is inefficient, therefore this other area suffers”.
Recent workload, fitness level, nutrition, amount of sleep, mental stress, environmental changes, and many, many other factors can all play a huge role in the breakdown of tissue.
Those factors aside, what can often get overlooked is the very real part that mental and emotional stress can play in an athlete’s well-being.
Stress is how your body responds to events in your life.
Relationships, school, work, and training are all examples of stressors. Your experiences and how you handle these stressors can move your body into a sympathetic (fight or flight) or parasympathetic (relax and recover) state.
Ideally, your body maintains a nice flow and balance between these two states.
When the time comes to train and perform, you want your sympathetic nervous system to be more active. When training or a game is finished, it’s time to move into a more parasympathetic state for recovery.
Spending too much time on one end of the spectrum can impact performance and health in a negative manner. They can make activities more taxing on the body than normal, especially if one becomes more sympathetically dominant.
An example of this would be an athlete being sorer from a 40-pitch bullpen during a week where they had three exams as opposed to a week where they had no tests.
The stress of the bullpen didn’t change, but they’re more likely in a sympathetic state due to the stress of the exams.
As previously stated, certain stressors can move your body into a more sympathetic or parasympathetic state.
Let’s take another example of a pitcher I saw recently with a shoulder injury he sustained during the season. Initially, he had some tightness in the back of his shoulder that he was ignoring.
He continued to pitch through it, increasing tightness and fatigue and eventually sustained an injury. His shoulder has since healed and he has returned to his normal throwing routine.
But now he is nervous about feeling any tightness in the back of his shoulder. His body is more alert to that sensation than it was previously.
The tightness itself, which can be a normal consequence of throwing, is now a stressor that can move him towards a more sympathetic state.
This could be both a benefit and a detriment to the athlete. It can potentially alert him to fatigue and that he may need to cut back his throwing routine.
Or, he could take any tightness as a sign of potential injury, immediately shut down, and be unable to make any significant progress with training due to constant fear of re-injury.
An athlete’s experiences with medical providers can also lead to long-term stressors which can become detrimental. During recovery, he went to the doctor who diagnosed him with GIRD (a loss of shoulder internal rotation) as a major contributor to his injury.
He went to physical therapy, where they told him his injury was a result of weakness in his scapular muscles and tightness in his hips. Using our current example, just from this one injury experience the athlete now has the following negative thoughts associated with throwing:
None of these statements are definitively true, however.
There are plenty of athletes with inflexible hips and shoulders who feel tightness during throwing but can still pitch at an extremely high level without ever suffering an injury. Does it mean this athlete doesn’t need to focus on those areas with his training ever? Of course not.
But he also doesn’t need to spend a half-hour every day focusing on corrective exercise for these areas. High-level athletic performance requires an athlete to have a great deal of trust in their body.
With every flaw an athlete possesses pointed out to them on a treatment table, it not only reduces the trust they have in themselves but it can also create a chronic stressor. This may drive them further towards the sympathetic end of the spectrum, reducing their capacity to adapt to other stressors that are already present in baseball and life.
So, what can we do to ensure that athletes are still receiving high-quality care while not developing a fragility mindset?
Unfortunately, I don’t believe there is an easy answer to this question.
I do believe the answer starts with understanding that a great many factors go into an injury or decreased performance. While movement deficiencies do play a role, they likely don’t contribute more than workload, throwing fitness, recovery and so on.
Many times I have suggested the idea of taking “inventory” of what is going on in their lives. This can be an end of training reflection, journaling exercise, or some other practice. This can help identify any additional things in their lives that could be impacting their training.
Over the past week, maybe their arm has not been feeling great. But as they look back, they realize they are having trouble with a close friend. Or maybe they haven’t made any velocity gains, but they also haven’t been sleeping well because they are keeping themselves up at night worrying about it.
Giving themselves an awareness of stressors can have a benefit in keeping an athlete from being too sympathetically dominant.
Athletes, coaches, parents and health care providers should be educated about this process. They should also be educated on how adaptable the human body truly is. Even in the absence of “optimal movement”, our bodies adjust to stresses placed on it and become more resilient overall.
Focusing on building that resilience should be just as—if not more—important than trying to fix areas that are inefficient. Giving athletes that knowledge and the feeling of being a strong, adaptable human can become a huge asset for them in their goal of being a healthy, high-level athlete.

Making Movement Changes in the Weight Room - Driveline Baseball,2019-03-20T06:21:12+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/03/making-movement-changes-weight-room/,"You can’t outcue a movement deficiency. These are words we live by at Driveline Baseball and that’s what our makes our assessment process so vital for getting our athletes results. Individually, our assessments don’t provide nearly as much value as they do as a whole. However, once we combine the biomechanics report and throwing videos with the range-of-motion assessment and VBT testing, that’s where the real magic can happen.
When Mariners reliever Dan Altavilla came to Driveline, his situation was unlike many of those that come here. Most athletes come to Driveline to increase velocity, improve strength, or develop a pitch using Rapsodo and edgertronic video. While Dan did work on pitch design remotely, today we’re going to focus on how the rest of Dan’s assessment focused his programming. Considering Dan’s solid big-league numbers, a peak velocity of 100.46 mph last year, and his exceptional baseline strength, finding the biggest limiting factor was a bigger challenge for us.
After missing some time with an injury in 2018, Dan knew that he needed to work on improving mobility to his muscle-bound frame. Which raises the question, How will adding mobility decrease the chance of injury? From looking at his VBT testing, it’s easy to see that he can put a lot of force into the ground, but what happens when that force moving up the kinetic chain can’t be absorbed? This video from our Director of Performance, Sam Briend, shows how that energy is transferred from the lower half to the arm.
The first thing we identified through Dan’s range-of-motion assessment was a lack of external rotation in his hips. Lacking hip external rotation can limit a pitcher’s ability to hold torque in the rear hip as the center of mass moves down the mound. Think about the squat and deadlift cue: “screwing the feet into the floor.” The point of screwing the feet is to stabilize the hips from being pulled towards the midline. When an athlete can hold torque in his rear hip, it allows the pelvis rotation to be driven by the glute rather than femoral internal rotation. In Dan’s baseline throwing videos, you can see his inability to hold tension in his rear hip as his center of mass moves towards the Plyo Ball ® wall. This can lead to a late pelvis rotation after foot contact, which puts him in a bad spot to have an effective lead-leg block.
The lead-leg block is a by-product of everything that happens before foot contact. You can see the effect that pelvis rotation has on the lead leg from this sugar packet and a butter knife from our biomechanist Anthony Brady:
Another issue we found in Dan’s range-of-motion assessment was a lack of thoracic rotation. Having thoracic rotation aids in creating hip and shoulder separation. As the pelvis opens, the torso has to counter rotate in order to create separation. If an athlete lacks thoracic rotation to his counter-rotation direction, his torso will rotate at the same time as his pelvis. The thoracic rotation is what we’re able to measure in our mobility assessment; we wanted to see how that number compares to how Dan moves dynamically in his biomechanics report.
When assessing hip and shoulder separation, the timing between peak-pelvis and peak-torso angular velocities is arguably more important than the degree of separation. Dan’s biomechanics report shows that while his degree of hip-shoulder separation was sufficient at 39 degrees, the timing between peak-pelvis and peak-torso angular velocities was just 0.0188 seconds, which is on the lower end of what we see.
This is important, because if we look at the joint-by-joint approach, we know that the hips should be mobile, the lumbar spine stable, and the thoracic spine mobile. Therefore, if an athlete lacks range of motion or strength in his hips, the hips will stabilize to protect themselves, which causes a compensatory effect that forces the lumbar spine to be mobile and limits the range of motion through the thoracic spine.
Sometimes addressing a thoracic-mobility issue means addressing the hips and pelvis. Knowing that Dan lacked hip external rotation in both hips, we knew that if we worked on increasing range of motion in his hips and strengthening that new range of motion, the benefits could potentially work up the chain.
Once you’ve assessed an athlete, it’s important to take a step back and look at the big picture. As you’ll see, you can use the assessment to better target what you want to improve from when they first get to the gym to when they leave.
Based on the information from above, we designed a daily warm-up to attack these specific movement deficiencies. The objective of the warm-up is to get the athlete in better alignment prior to whatever activity he is going to do. It should progress from general exercises that address the athlete’s deficiencies to specific exercises that prime the body for what he is about to do.
Looking at his warm-up, we have Wall Press Dead Bug and Bear Crawl in there to address anterior core and pelvis stability that could be leading to his limited hip external rotation. Most anterior core exercises stabilize the hip external rotators. The Side Lying Windmill w/ Full Exhale is to address the lack of thoracic spine rotation.
Once we get through the “corrective exercises” we move into more movement-based exercises that prime him for the movement he’s about to do (pitching) and also address his deficiencies. That’s where the Banded Hip Abduction and Alternating Lateral Lunge w/ Reach come into play. The Banded Hip Abduction targets the gluteus medius, which is the prime mover for hip external rotation, and the Lateral Lunge is a frontal-plane exercise that helps him feel the load of the hip that he is lunging into.
Since he had just finished a full season, we wanted to stay away from a high volume of rotational med-ball work; however, there is some value to patterning movement with med-ball exercises so early in the offseason, so we programmed more anti-rotation med-ball exercises that helped pattern the movement we were looking to improve when pitching. The Half Kneeling Med Ball Scoop Toss forced him to stabilize his lead leg as he rotates the medicine ball over it into the wall.
Once we were able to get into some more high-intensity rotation exercises, we used the Step Back Med Ball Shotput throw to help address his inability to hold torque in his rear hip, and the Split Stance Recoil Rollover Throw to Wall to add a rotational component to an exercise designed to use the lead leg to propel the trunk into flexion.
After a month of cleaning up some technique flaws, we got right into dynamic-effort work because spending too much time doing maximum-strength work would be disadvantageous for Dan based on where his strength levels were. In the one-month technique on-ramp, we lived in the four-rep range and kept the load the same each week, focusing on quality of movement.
Once we got into dynamic-effort work, he paired squats in the strength/speed velocity range (0.75-1.0 m/s or 50-60% of a one rep max) with overload jumps. Because he was so muscle bound, the extra load for the jumps allowed him to summon that extra tension for jumps before transitioning into a more true-speed phase.
As far as addressing movement deficiencies in the weight room, we used a variety of methods, including adding tempo to accessory exercises to increase stability in the hips and pairing those with mobility exercises. An example is a Barbell Romanian Deadlift with a two second isometric paired with a Pigeon Pose to Half Kneeling. The Pigeon Pose to Half Kneeling takes the traditional pigeon pose, which stretches the hip into external rotation, and adds a movement to force the athlete to move in and out of hip external rotation. The goal is to increase the range of motion with the mobility exercise and then strengthen within that new range of motion.
Clip of Dan throwing during this spring training
This a solid example of why an integrated approach is so crucial for getting athletes results. It greatly benefits athletes for their coaches in multiple domains to look over information and discuss what each athlete needs. A strength coach can’t decide to stay in his lane and just focus on getting athletes stronger, because there will eventually be an athlete like Dan who is already strong enough and needs to focus his attention on other things. A pitching coach can’t just cue an athlete to “stay in his back hip” or “rotate his pelvis” because the athlete might not have the range-of-motion capabilities to do so.
In order to work towards achieving the athlete’s goals and needs determined during the assessment process, you need an R&D department that can tell you what is happening and a High Performance department that can help fill in the gaps about why it is happening. Once those two things are solved, the High Performance department and pitching coaches can work together to develop a plan to directly attack the issues at hand.

Phasic Loading: Eccentric Overload Programming Considerations - Driveline Baseball,2018-12-06T03:25:39+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/12/phasic-loading-eccentric-overload-programming-considerations/,"Dr. John P. Wagle defines accentuated eccentric loading as eccentric loads in excess of the concentric prescription of movements that require coupled eccentric and concentric action while creating minimal interruption to the natural mechanics of the selected exercise. In other words, it is lifting a heavier weight during the eccentric phase instead of the concentric phase of the exercise, without allowing the extra load on the eccentric phase impact the technique of the lift.
Since muscles are approximately 40% stronger during eccentric contractions than during concentric contractions, this means that you can load greater than 100% of your one-rep max for the eccentric phase. Eccentric strength is also critical for many actions involved in sports.
The goal of accentuated eccentric loading is to achieve potentiation. Potentiation is the increase in strength of nerve imPulse along pathways that have been used previously, either short-term or long-term. In other words, we want to increase the eccentric rate of force development.
One benefit of the eccentric muscle action is force absorption, which plays a huge role in any change of direction. For example, as the lead foot makes contact with the ground during the pitching delivery, the body has to absorb the force before the concentric imPulse.
Another benefit of eccentric muscle action is elastic spring function utilizing the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC). The SSC can be defined as an active stretch (eccentric contraction) of a muscle followed by an immediate shortening (concentric contraction) of that same muscle. In the pitching delivery, the SSC is used during scapular load to unload. The SSC also plays a huge role in sprinting and jumping, and, if you’re interested, we’ve also written more about the SSC in pitching mechanics.
Some other benefits of accentuated eccentric loading include the following: a larger hormonal response that can lead to higher testosterone levels post-training, an increase in cross-sectional area of type IIx muscle fibers, potentially a work capacity benefit, and an opportunity for athletes to retain and build max strength as higher bar velocities to focus on during velocity-based training.
The two main methods of accentuated eccentric loading are supramaximal loading, or more than a one-rep max, and submaximal loading, or less than a one-rep max. Supramaximal loads are best for athletes looking to increase their eccentric rate of force development. This method can be used for increasing strength or to maintain strength while focusing on bar velocity. When using to increase strength, the eccentric load can be ~105% of a one-rep max, whereas the concentric load can be 70-90% of a one-rep max. Research shows that the eccentric rate of force development stays increased for up to two reps after the weight is released. Because of this, sets should be performed as clusters. For example, you could perform one set of two to three reps, rest for 10-15 seconds, put the weight releasers back on back, and then perform two to three more reps.
When the focus shifts to speed work, the eccentric load can be ~105% of a one-rep max, and the concentric load can be 40-60% of a one-rep max. Bar-speed analyzing devices can also be used to determine the load for the concentric based on the speed range desired.
Submaximal eccentric loading is another method that can be used for accentuated eccentric loading. This is where both the eccentric and concentric loads are less than your one-rep max, but the eccentric load is still larger than the eccentric load. This method is best for athletes looking to increase concentric imPulse or the speed at which they can switch from an eccentric to concentric movement.
When using submaximal loads, the focus should be on bar velocity. An important detail when deciding what loads to use for the eccentric and concentric phase of the lift is that the eccentric load needs to exceed at least 30% difference from the concentric load to achieve potentiation.
If you don’t have access to weight releasers, other methods to consider include dumbbells, bands, and manual removal.
Dumbbells are a great option for exercises like jumping. Determine what 130% of an athlete’s body weight is, and have him hold dumbbells that make his total weight 130%. For example, 130% of 200 lb. is 260 lb., therefore a 200 lb. athlete would need to hold 30 lb. dumbbells in each hand. When going into the countermovement of a jump, drop the weights before going into the concentric phase of the jump. These can be paired with a heavy lower-body exercise for post-activation potentiation or paired with an exercise when bar velocity is the focus.
Bands can be used for accommodating resistance for exercises like squat, bench, and deadlift. While this is not true eccentric overload, the resistance will be heaviest at the beginning of the eccentric phase and lightest at the beginning of the concentric phase.
Adding tools like bands, med balls, and dumbbells to jumping variations are great for adding extra tension to the movement. This will help an athlete tap into the slow stretch-shortening cycle and give an athlete coming out of a strength phase and going into a speed phase more time to develop force.
When prescribing accentuated eccentric loading, it is important to take training economy into consideration. The eccentric phase of an exercise does the most damage to muscle fibers and is often what causes delayed onset muscle soreness. Therefore, when we are overloading or accentuating that phase of the exercise, it can crush an athlete.
We primarily prescribe eccentric overload to athletes during the offseason when their skill-specific training volume is low to moderate. It can be used during velocity or high intensity training phases, but volume should be modified to avoid overtraining. We would not recommend performing accentuated eccentric loading in-season.
Accentuated eccentric loading can be a great tool for advanced athletes, and research has shown that it has some decent benefits: an improved ability to absorb force; an increase in elastic spring for the stretch-shortening cycle, allow athletes to maintain strength as higher velocities become the emphasis; and hormonal and neural benefits as well. Accentuated eccentric loading can be used with supramaximal and submaximal loads and bands and dumbbells can be used if weight releasers are unavailable.

Velocity-Based Training: Programming Considerations - Driveline Baseball,2018-12-05T05:04:45+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/12/velocity-based-training-programming-considerations/,"We have written about what exactly velocity-based training is and how to broadly go about implementing that, but we wanted to go a bit more in-depth about the way many ways we use velocity-based training with our athletes at Driveline Baseball.
During our strength assessment, we have athletes perform three sets of back squats, trap bar deadlifts, and barbell bench press. For each, we attach a Linear Displacement Transducer Device (currently a Tendo unit while we test our VBT unit) to the bar to determine the average bar velocities in meters per second. We use an algorithm to determine an estimated elite one-rep max based on their height and weight in order to determine how much weight each athlete will lift. The algorithm is roughly based on a two times body-weight squat, two and half times body-weight deadlift, and one and a half times body-weight bench press. We say roughly because a 225-pound athlete will have a much different perceived elite one-rep max than a 160-pound athlete, and a 6’ 6” inch athlete will have a much more difficult time squatting to depth than a 5’ 7” athlete. Once we determine that estimated one-rep max, we then test at 30%, 40%, and 50% of that number.
The velocities at these numbers give us a few different pieces of information that help us individualize our programs. First, there is a pass/fail aspect to the assessment. We want each rep to fall at or above certain velocity ranges. For example, the 30% rep should be >1.3 m/s, the 40% rep should be between 1.0 and 1.15m/s, and the 50% rep should be between 0.85 and 1.0 m/s.
Next, the spreads between the numbers will help us form a force-velocity profile for each athlete. For example, a strength-based athlete will perform the 50% rep better than the 30% rep, and a speed-based athlete may better perform the 30% or 40% rep than the 50% rep.
Percentage-based programming is the last piece of information we can use the velocities for. Because the weights that we test are relatively light and a much safer alternative to max testing, we can use the velocities to calculate a projected one-rep max. For example, 0.8 m/s is 60% of an athlete’s daily one-rep max—yes, a one-rep max can fluctuate based on the day. But, if an athlete moves 225 pounds at ~0.8 m/s, we can calculate that his projected one-rep max is 375 pounds on that given exercise. We can then take that information and prescribe sets of four reps at 70% of his one rep max if he is in a strength phase.
While we primarily use velocity-based training for speed-based work, it can be a great tool when high bar velocities are not the training goal.
Earlier, we discussed how to use the assessment velocity numbers to prescribe weights for percentage-based programs, as well as how a projected one-rep max can fluctuate based on the day. One way to work around these factors and auto-regulate the on-the-bar load is to have feedback of bar velocity.
We know strength as 70-90%, for three to five sets of four to eight reps. If we compare this to the velocity-based training continuum, we see that falls in the accelerative strength velocity ranges of 0.5-0.75 m/s.
With that information, we could program three to five sets of four to eight reps and tell the athlete to find a weight that he can move all of the prescribed reps within that speed range. This will help autoregulate the load for him. On a day that the athlete is feeling more fatigued than usual, rather than forcing him to add 5-10 pounds to the bar and crushing them, we stay within the speed range and get the desired stimulus.
For power, we know that is three to five sets of two to five reps at 75-95% of a one-rep max. Because those percentages fall within both absolute strength and accelerative strength, I might have this athlete perform his prescribed sets and reps at a weight that he can move between 0.3 and 0.6 m/s.
The first speed range to touch on is strength/speed. Strength/speed is defined as moving a moderately heavy weight as fast as possible. The loads here range anywhere from 50 to 60% of a one-rep max and 0.75 and 1.0 m/s.
Speed/strength, on the other hand, is defined with speed as the first priority and strength as the second. In other words, it uses lighter loads at faster velocities. The loads here range from 30 to 40% of a one-rep max and velocities from 1.0 to 1.3 m/s.
An important note on training for speed/strength is that when performing the three main lifts of squat, deadlift, and bench press, the range of motion is too short to perform at velocities above 1.0 m/s. To make up for this, we recommend adding accommodating resistance in bands or chains to the bar. This allows the athlete to focus on accelerating the bar at high velocities without having to decelerate the bar as much at the top of the lift.
Starting strength is the last velocity range on the velocity-based training continuum. When training for starting strength, the load is 30% or less of a one-rep max, and it should be moved above 1.3 m/s. Starting strength is the ability to rapidly overcome inertia from a dead stop. The three main lifts should not be trained above 1.3 m/s. If you were to prescribe Olympic lifts, this would be the velocity range to train them in. At Driveline, we use Trap Bar Jumps at 1.3 m/s and above because research has shown that power output is similar and there is far less risk on athletes’ wrists and shoulders. They’re also easier to measure for power output due to a consistent bar path.
As far as sets and reps go for training in the speed ranges, we typically prescribe six sets of two reps. While the load is relatively light, the athlete should try to move the bar as fast as possible, which makes it a max-effort exercise. We know that when training for max power, the work rest ratio is 1:12, so an exercise lasting 5-10 seconds using the phosphagen energy system should have a rest period of 60 seconds.
Because of the shorter rest period, there is also a large work-capacity component to training in the speed-velocity ranges. This can result in athletes being better conditioned for the sport of baseball since actions occur roughly every 30 seconds in a baseball game.
Earlier, we talked about how we can use velocities from the assessment to create a force velocity curve and figure out if an athlete is more strength-based or more speed-based. How an athlete profiles plays a huge role in how we program for them.
Here is an example of an athlete who profiles as more speed-based than strength-based. We can see that his 30% rep is at 1.37 m/s, which is above the 1.3 m/s number we are looking for, and his 50% rep is slightly below the 0.85-1.0 m/s range we are looking for. Some might see this and program maximum-strength work because it could be this athlete’s biggest room for adaptation. However, if we lose strength in the process of addressing a weakness, we are not improving this athlete. Because this athlete profiles as more speed-based, it may be disadvantageous for this athlete to spend too much time doing maximum-strength work and more beneficial for him to focus on improving his speed.
This example shows an athlete who is above what we are looking for on all three of his reps but likely profiles a bit more as strength-based by looking at how high his 50% rep is and the small spread between his 30% rep and 50% rep. Because he is well above on all three of his reps, he likely has reached a point of diminishing returns when it comes to maximum-strength work; taking his back squat from a projected one rep max of 405 to 500 is likely not the limiting factor in developing velocity.
With that being said, because this athlete is so strength-based, he may struggle when trying to perform speed work. An option for him would be to perform exercises in high velocity ranges with accommodating resistance in order to help him create the extra tension needed to move weight at high velocities.
In the final example, we can see that this athlete not only falls below the velocity ranges on all three reps, but also his spread is very short between all three reps. This tells us that the athlete lacks not only the ability to apply force but also to apply force quickly.
Because of that, we might do a more linear periodization with this athlete and spend some time doing strength work (0.5-0.75 m/s) until he lifts a certain number in that velocity range. Once the predetermined number has been hit, he can then move into an absolute strength block (0.3-0.6 m/s).
Once the athlete’s strength is sufficient, high velocity speed work can be prescribed.
Many people think of velocity-based training as a high velocity training protocol only, but
VBT is a great tool that can be used for assessment protocols, autoregulation during training blocks, and as a modality for elite athletes who have reached a point of diminishing returns with their maximum strength numbers. That point of diminishing returns will always be on a case-by-case basis, and that’s what makes test/retest periods so vital to writing a successful program.

At what point does an athlete become able to produce enough force to be able to start to train speed strength? Is it relative to body weight?
Roger- You can use 2.5X bodyweight(BW) in the deadlift, 2X BW squat, and 1.5X BW bench for ideal 1 rep max numbers (keep in mind the height of the athlete). Using sub-maximal weight to determine force production – the 30% rep should be >1.3 m/s, the 40% rep should be between 1.0 and 1.15m/s, and the 50% rep should be between 0.85 and 1.0 m/s. If those are met, the athlete will be put into a strength program prioritizing speed.
Is velocity based training okay to do in season? Or is it only for the offseason?
Hey Brett, VBT can be used in season. Most of the time we will be dialing back the volume of the workouts for in season work. The main goal for most of our higher level athletes is maintenance. We want to maintain strength while still putting them in the best position, physically, to compete in games.

Bench Press: A Deep Dive with Programming Considerations - Driveline Baseball,2018-11-16T04:08:23+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/11/bench-press-deep-dive-programming-considerations/,"The bench press is one of the most widely debated exercises in the world of training baseball players, specifically pitchers. Despite the debate, not only is the bench press part of our assessment process but also some pressing variation is included in almost all of our athletes’ programs, to some extent. Much like weighted balls, the bench press is all about smart programming, proper execution, and the right population. Let’s explore this in more detail.
First, I want to dive into the benefits of the bench press, so let’s begin with the muscles involved. The prime movers in a bench press are the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and anterior deltoid, whereas the triceps and serratus anterior work to stabilize the movement. The antagonist muscles are the latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoids, and biceps. The rhomboids help keep the scapula retracted during the movement.
The latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major are two of the muscles that help accelerate the shoulder. The shoulder internally rotates at a max speeds upwards of 4600 °/s during the throwing movement. The serratus anterior is one of the three muscles that help upwardly rotate the scapula when the shoulder goes into flexion or abduction.
Research has shown that lacking shoulder flexion can put an athlete at a higher risk for injury. If the serratus anterior is weak, it could limit the ability to have sufficient flexion or abduction of the shoulder. The rhomboids are a prime mover in scapula retraction which aids in shoulder horizontal abduction in the delivery, also known as a scap load.
We test the bench press because it’s a great representation of overall upper-body strength. As far as performance goes, there is a study done by Mário C. Marques, et. al that shows a relationship between bench-press bar speed and throwing velocity in elite handball players.
From an injury-prevention standpoint, because the muscles used in the bench press help accelerate the shoulder, stabilize the scapula, and aid in upward rotation, it’s important to see if those muscles can apply force quickly since the throwing delivery is a very fast movement.
What we program for our athletes always depends on their training age, injury history, and movement assessment. There are many progressions and regressions for the bench press, and we want to match the athlete with the most ideal pressing exercise possible.
If an athlete has a previous shoulder injury, we may regress him to a push up or swiss-bar bench press to get him in a more shoulder-friendly position. If an athlete’s assessment shows that he has poor shoulder flexion or abduction, we may regress him to a landmine pressing variation to get him to work on scapular upward rotation directly. If an athlete has a young training age, we may regress him to a dumbbell bench press or dumbbell floor press that have a smaller learning curve.
As far as progressions go, once an athlete has perfected technique and sufficient strength, we can start to work on more dynamic effort and focus on bar speed. We can also add accommodating resistance with chains and/or bands. A few exercises that can be added as progressions are spoto bench press and incline and decline variations. These exercises are great for adding variety while also helping to improve the bench press.
As said earlier, the problem with bench press is not the exercise itself; rather it’s the execution and generally how it is used in programming. Most people are not very technically sound when it comes to bench press, because it is far more complex than lying on a bench and pushing a barbell.
First, I want to talk the setup. Like most exercises, the setup is crucial; if you don’t start in a good position, you likely won’t move well during the movement. The goals of the setup are to have an arch in your thoracic spine, keep the scapula retracted, and have your feet in a good position to put force into the floor; people forget that the bench press is a full body exercise.
The setup is a bit different for everybody, depending on what feels like the best position to press the weight while protecting the shoulders. To get extension through the thoracic spine, start with the bar at head height and use your feet to drive your body back until the bar is at eye height. Foot position varies depending on body types. Feet can be wide and flat out front wide and flat back in line with the hips or narrow with heels up in back and in line with the hips. To retract the shoulder blades, leverage the rack and push the shoulder blades back and down into retraction.
Execution of the lift starts with the unracking of the bar. It’s important to think of pulling the bar off the rack by using your lats rather than pushing up and losing retraction to bring the bar out. Once the bar is unracked, I like to use the cue of “breaking the bar” or “bending the bar in half” to engage the lats. The eccentric portion of the movement should be similar to a row; thinking of “pulling” the bar to your chest can help with this. This will also help stabilize the muscles that are retracting the shoulder blades.
As long as tension is maintained in the lats, the upper arms should be about 45 degrees to the torso as you lower and press. Pressing the bar will start with leg drive. The biggest mistake made with leg drive is that people often go into hip extension and have their butts come off the bench. To fix this, think of knee extension and drive through the quads instead. From there, think of keeping the muscles in the back tight to avoid going into elbow flare, and imagine pushing yourself away from the bar. The shoulders should remain protracted as the arms lockout at the top of the rep.
The bench press is one of the biggest bang-for-your-buck exercises for the upper body. It can be used in hypertrophy and strength phases for beginner athletes looking to increase their strength base. It can be used for dynamic effort with more elite-level athletes looking for an increase in performance. How the exercise is implemented and executed always depends on an athlete’s assessment, training age, injury history as well as personal goals.

Pitching Assessments and Changing Mechanics - Driveline Baseball,2018-10-31T01:58:42+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/10/pitching-assessments-changing-mechanics/,"Updated 6/16/2022
Over the past few months, we’ve been traveling around the country performing assessments on athletes with our mobile biomechanics lab. The lab is a crucial piece of our assessment process since the summer of 2017. The reason it’s so key to our process is the data it provides and how it combines with our strength assessment. The culmination of this data shows much clearer than ever before how our athletes move and produce force. But what’s more important here is how it provides us with a means of creating actionable changes to an athlete’s mechanics that circumvent some of the frustrations of a traditional approach.
Before we go into how we address mechanical changes, we need to understand the type of data we’re looking at in each piece of the assessment process.
The biomechanics lab is a markered system that measures the kinematics and joint kinetics throughout the throwing motion—or the motion of segments and joints, as well as the underlying forces acting upon those joints. Typically, we look at measurements starting at foot contact, not to be confused with foot plant, since this is only the initial moment when the foot first contacts the ground up until ball release.
We can use this data to provide us with a clearer look at what positions an athlete is achieving at various points within his delivery. This provides a huge advantage over any other means of quantifying movement. For example, if instead we used video to assess an athlete’s movement, not only do we lack a full 360-degree perspective of the movement, but also if we filmed the same throw with slow motion on an iPhone, which films at 240 fps, and an athlete’s arm is rotating at 6,000 deg/sec, we’d lose 25-degrees of motion between each frame. That’s a significant amount of motion that video can’t show.
Even at extremely high frame rates, the arm still blurs, and we lose a lot of understanding of how an athlete is actually moving.
Furthermore, a biomechanics assessment allows us to see things imperceptible to the eye, even on high-quality slow-motion video. For example, you may be able to see that an athlete is generating a decent amount of hip-to-shoulder separation on video, but you can’t see the timing of when the pelvis rotation peaks in comparison to torso rotation. Within the biomechanics data, we are not only able to quantify the degrees of separation but also the crucial timing of when the pelvis and torso reach peak angular velocity.
The ROM assessment in and of itself isn’t groundbreaking. We hand measure each ROM with a goniometer and assess both active and passive ROMs for various movements. Some of this data provides us with potential injury predictors; others provide us with stability or ROM restrictions that may be impacting performance. The main piece here is that it’s not subjective. Each position is measured, which limits the experimenter bias that may happen in less objective ROM assessment processes.
The strength assessment seeks to examine an athlete’s force-velocity profile. We use the tendo unit to determine barbell velocities at three different percentages (30%, 40%, and 50%) of an idealized one-rep max (1RM) for squat, deadlift, and bench press. The 1RM is determined using an allometric score, factoring both the height and weight of an athlete. This data can then give us some insight into how strong, how explosive, and how efficient an athlete is at moving at different weights.
To help provide some context as to what each piece of the assessment looks like, here’s a snippet of data from one of our pro pitchers, who used to sit in the mid 90s but now averages upper 80s.
The photo above is a look at the max hip-to-shoulder separation he generates during his delivery and at the timing of his peak-pelvis rotational velocity to his peak-torso rotational velocity. Ideally, here we want to see him generate a higher degree of hip-to-shoulder separation and have the timing between peak pelvis and torso rotation be at .05s or greater.
From the ROM assessment we see that his thoracic ROM is significantly lower on the left side. Since he’s a left-handed pitcher, it’s common to have a deficit to the throwing side. However, we know he already generates a low amount of hip-to-shoulder separation and because of this we would like to see a higher degree of thoracic rotation.
His strength assessment is significantly below the parameters we look for on all weights, but by examining the spreads between velocities, we see that the gap between them is fairly consistent, though greater than what we typically like to see. This suggests that the athlete is likely weak but explosive in nature since the lightest weight was only .18 off the mark, whereas the heaviest weight was .41 below the desired number.
We no longer perform VBT for our assessments, you can read more on our current assessment process at the bottom of this blog.
Admittedly, we’re not the first to use any one of these pieces to assess athletes. ASMI has had a biomechanics lab since 1987, ROM has been assessed long before the invention of the first goniometer, and, though velocity-based training technology is somewhat new, strength coaches have been using various percentages for decades to assess and train their athletes.
The game changer is how we examine the assessment. Typically, most places provide assessment reports in the form of piece-by-piece data labeling inefficiencies, similar to the above. There are also no prescriptions to correct these inefficiencies, so unless you have a high-level knowledge of movement, mobility, and stability, you really don’t know how to go about enacting change.
What we aim to do at Driveline is to combine each piece into a whole and then attack any deficiencies through an integrated approach. To better provide clarity, let’s discuss all of the data above from our pro pitcher and how they factor together.
So, we know from the biomechanics report that the athlete mentioned above is lacking hip-to-shoulder separation and the timing of this movement is poor. This is likely linked to his lack of thoracic ROM and his inability to rotate to his throwing side, but why can’t he rotate? The last piece of the assessment helps provide an answer: he’s lacking strength. So, for an athlete who once threw in the mid 90s, his hips and torso have to rotate at extremely high velocities. If his strength is poor, especially hip and core, then his body will provide protective tightness so that he doesn’t put damaging levels of stress on his spine.
What you haven’t seen is that his right hip also has a deficit in hip IR, creating a total IR/ER ROM deficit of 14 degrees. The right hip has created protective tightness to prevent itself from working into a ROM it doesn’t feel safe in, the lumbar spine has since become mobile rather than stable, and this has caused him to experience a myriad of lower-back issues over the years. From there, his t-spine has become stable since the lumbar spine is now mobile, the root cause for his significant deficit in hip-to-shoulder separation. Furthermore, this carries all the way up to the shoulder where he has a slight deficit in left-shoulder IR causing a total IR/ER ROM deficit in the throwing shoulder that is similar in nature to the right hip.
In order to get him back to throwing mid 90s, we first and foremost need to restore ROM and strength to the hips and core.
You may be reading this and say, “Well I’ve done parts of this. My trainers collect ROM data, I use video, my strength coaches improve strength. We’re doing all of these things even though we don’t sit down and discuss it together. Does that matter?” Or maybe you only do some of these things, but not all, so how does that impact the way you program and coach?
Let’s take a look at the same pro athlete’s data and consider how if you only look at one piece of the assessment, then you may wind up spinning your wheels and not developing your athlete at all, or worst case, decreasing his performance. For example, say you only look at the biomechanics data and see his deficit in hip-to-shoulder separation. We know we need to improve this, so you program roll-in drills to help him get into a position where his torso is closed while the pelvis opens into foot contact. However, he’s physically incapable of getting into that position, and repeatedly doing it and failing overtime will result in both he and you growing frustrated. You might think he’s lazy and he loses buy in with what you’re trying to get him to do.
This kind of scenario happens all the time in a variety of ways. We’ve seen it with athletes from a ROM aspect as well. The same athlete could come in and get assessed and find out he has a deficit in thoracic rotation. His coach programs a bunch of mobility drills around t-spine mobility, but the athlete is hypermobile and lacks stability. He does the drills religiously, but he winds up having worse rotation than at the beginning. Often the coach goes on to blame the athlete—saying he didn’t do the work, he was lazy with his reps—and meanwhile the athlete’s getting worse because his body craves stability and all you’re doing is adding more ROM.
Lastly, imagine you only look at his strength data. Sure, you know he’s weak and you know he has to get stronger, but what you may not see is the deficit in hip mobility. You may spend the next few training blocks hammering out bilateral strength, but if you’re not addressing his frontal plane and core stability, you may not help him restore his ROM. You’ve helped him gain a bunch of strength, but he may not be able to effectively apply that force and transfer it because his movement quality is still poor.
We’ve addressed part of this already, but to take this full circle, let’s discuss how we can use the assessment data to make changes to an athlete’s mechanics.
If you follow Driveline, you likely have an idea of how we use backwards chaining, over- and under-load weighted baseballs, Plyo Ball ®, and high-intensity training to alter mechanics. It’s a huge piece of our success and one that we’re constantly refining. One of the ways we’re doing this currently is using our biomechanics report to adjust programming by altering what Plyo Ball ® are thrown, what drills we use, how many reps are performed, as well as other things to influence mechanical changes.
This is something the baseball world has roughly been doing forever: seeing mechanical flaws and using drills to try and correct for them. With the biomechanics report, we just have a much more targeted approach.
However, where the real magic happens is what we can do on the strength side to drive mechanical changes. As mentioned previously, a lot of the time you’re putting athletes in drills or coaching positions they’re actually incapable of getting into. Using the biomechanics, strength, and ROM assessments, we can structure soft-tissue work and a warm-up around an athlete’s deficiencies by working to open up ROM, strengthen through the newly obtained ROM, and then priming for the rest of the workout.
As for the actual lifts, consider this excellent quote by Vern Gambetta: “We want to train movements, not muscles.” Sure, we want to get guys stronger, but we have to target the movements we do poorly and strengthen the ones we do well. This is what helps drive mechanical changes.
For example, we’re big believers in using med balls once we’re confident an athlete’s hip and core strength is ready for it. Med balls work well because they’re a power exercise, but not so light that they create a large amount of fatigue, which provides us with a great way to get extra repetitions of the movements we want to change when we can’t throw more baseballs.
The key here is that we’re not giving the athletes answers; we’re not telling them how to move or breaking everything down into a specific movement. That’s not an efficient way to learn. Instead, we help athletes achieve the adequate strength and ROM to move more efficiently through weight-room work and then use high-intent weighted-ball training with external cueing as the bread crumbs to allow athletes to self discover how to move optimally for themselves.
What we really want you to take away from this post is the importance of a full in-depth assessment for improving player development. You may not have the ability to perform each of these pieces the way we do at Driveline, but if you aren’t integrating these pieces to really take an in-depth look at your athletes, then you’re missing out on huge opportunities to make strides in their performance.
However, this is all useless if you still go about trying to change mechanics solely through internal cueing or drill work. You need more than that. Changing ingrained movement patterns is difficult, especially when a large amount of how athletes move is purely a result of their strength and ROM. Start thinking about different ways to create movement change. Don’t break the movements down into unnecessary pieces, but start assessing them and then structuring programs around what the athletes’ deficiencies are. If you’re putting them in constraint drills that force them to correct their deficiencies in order to throw harder, you’ll start finding that athletes will often begin moving better on their own as they begin to gain the strength and ROM to do so.

Starting in 2020, we revamped our strength assessment. Due to certain limitations in the tendo and similar units, we elected to begin using force plates. An overview of the testing battery can be found here. We use a range of tests to find the athlete’s Maximal Strength, Explosive Strength, and Reactive Strength.
Limitations using bar speed include standardization, accuracy of the technology, and skill involved in the lifts themselves. The aim was to minimize these limits and create a more robust dataset with our athletes. The new battery of tests has done this to a high degree and allowed us to continue to improve athlete results while creating some very interesting models, such as predicted velocity.
Great article. I will use this while rehabbing my pitchers. Most of the time they want to start “changing their mechanics” when they start rehab. I have to convince them to get mobile, stable and strong first. Thanks.

Comparing Coaching Philosophies - Driveline Baseball,2018-07-17T23:24:48+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/07/comparing-coaching-philosophies/,"Our methods for teaching hitting and pitching differ from most. While there are many different styles of coaching, even those who have seen or worked with such variety find that our methods stand out in a number of ways.
We’ve previously discussed various reasons for why we use weighted balls and wrist weights, as well as why we use weighted bats and constraints in hitting.
However, we have not spent much time discussing the underlying philosophical reasons for our methods.
To best, and briefly, show how our coaching is different, let’s break down a comparison by looking at a more common method of coaching compared to some of the philosophies and theories that drove us to think of training in a different way.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
Broadly speaking, let’s consider a developmental model of how many coaches in baseball think about teaching hitting and pitching. Although many of them probably don’t mention a specific philosophy, we can see some themes.
Often, coaches select a hitter or pitcher that they personally believe to be an ideal hitter or pitcher. This is usually a very popular and successful professional baseball player.
After this, they first attempt to figure out what pieces of that player’s mechanics are the keys to his or her success. This usually comes from picking up what players say in interviews about their thought processes on training. Second, coaches often analyze mechanics using pictures or videos, which has become increasingly popular. From this, coaches will choose the “big idea” pieces or movements of what they wish to focus training on.
Train at Driveline
Lastly, coaches make up drills to funnel their players towards what they believe the “correct” movements to be. This usually comes to form by matching specific positions in the swing or when pitching—for example, “every pitcher has a good balance point” or “points the ball to second base” or “each hitter gets their foot down early.”
Those drills are then repeated until a sort of mechanical perfection is reached. Players’ performance in a game is looped back to practice, where the mechanical pieces that players need to improve are practiced.
This approach is supported by a belief that players have good mechanics when they do well and bad mechanics when they don’t. So, this means that because performance is a mechanical problem, it can be fixed by rote repetition.
Coaches who implement this approach mainly work around the idea of an athletic or a baseball-skill funnel. They see what the best players do, and they take their players from where they are to what the coaches believe is best to do.
On the occasion that they don’t have one idea athlete to model, there is the belief that “all great pitchers/hitters do X or Y.” This can continue to have as many steps as the funnel, as the coaches believes there are absolutes in hitting or pitching.
The last piece of this “mystery baseball coach philosophy” is that they try to get their players to replicate the ideal model by drills and verbal cues, generally with a heavy emphasis on internal cues and feel.
Now, we understand that feel is very important to many athletes. Many successful athletes keep routines not only because they prepare them, but also because they have a more consistent feel each time they perform.
But that can also result in an issue: feel can change day by day. Take a second to imagine what a great batting practice session or a great bullpen felt like. Now, compare that feeling to a day you practice after little sleep or when you were sore from lifting.
While the task did not change between those events, the feel did.
This coaching model is probably the most common. Unfortunately, there are a few flaws with how it scales with a large number of athletes. Mainly, it can dismiss certain strengths that athletes have in an attempt to box them into certain movements.
Good theories are not improved by piling up more evidence in support. However, seeing what evidence does and does not support the theory boxes it in and gives better perspective. This makes it so that the theories either become more accurate or needs to be dismissed.
The problem with the coaching model we mentioned above is that coaches almost always solely focus on narrowing down support, rather than looking for exceptions or evidence to the contrary. This leaves holes in any analysis.
All coaching philosophies that are based on the replication of one athlete’s movements have series flaws.
While this doesn’t dismiss the fact that high-level players likely share similar principles, they are most likely much more broad than what’s currently discussed. Plus, trying to narrow down movements to very specific checklists leaves little room for variability.
Now that we’ve discussed one of those common approaches, this is where we can take something from dynamic systems theory (DST).
If we quickly take a big picture look, dynamical systems perspective says that human movement consists of a highly intricate network of co-dependent sub-systems (e.g. respiratory, circulatory, nervous, skeletomuscular, perceptual) composed of many interactive parts (e.g. blood cells, oxygen molecules, muscle).
Whew, that’s a lot to take in. Let’s try another way to think of this definition: everything matters, and everything is a piece of the puzzle of athlete performance.
Performance isn’t a top down mechanical only ‘problem’ but something that have multiple variables to attend too.
To us, this can be first reframed in simpler terms as a comparison to the older school coaching model. We should acknowledgement that both problems keeping athletes from improving and solutions helping athletes to improve can come from many different areas.
DST isn’t cut and dry, but it offers a framework where multiple variables can affect a player.
There isn’t one mechanical model to box athletes into. There are multiple ways that coaches can go about improving an athlete’s movement besides directly coaching it.
The human body is a complex system with different aspects interwoven with one another.
This means that when trying to improve an athlete’s performance, the discussion shouldn’t focus only on mechanics; it should also focus on how mechanics play a role intertwined with mobility, strength, and other factors.
This differs from the older coaching model mentioned above, where athletic improvement comes from mechanical fixes and poor performance also comes from mechanical issues.
Now, for the sake of comparison, we can simplify things a little. Let’s consider three scenarios where we can take a multivariable approach to improving an athlete’s performance. For this, let’s simplify the variables to mechanics, strength, mobility and psych.
Note: The changes in the graphic do not represent changing importance or intent in each variable but the focus of each may change to meet a goal. These adjustments in programming are also made with workload management in mind.
This is where we can see how we are moving beyond a mechanics solution by looking at many factors and trying to address them accordingly.
We should also say that there is significantly more to cover on dynamical systems theory in many areas, but for an introduction of how it may relate to baseball, this should remain simple. We need to start looking at multiple causes and solutions rather than seeing everything through a mechanical lens.
We admit that trying to move to a system that considers more variables for improving player performance can be daunting.
It can take a lot of time to learn a lot about one domain, so it’s natural to feel overwhelmed by the need to know a lot about multiple domains. However, it mostly takes time, effort, and desire to learn.
This is also where we can do better at breaking down silos among different groups in order to better work together: coaches, strength coaches, physical therapists, etc. We’ve mentioned before that good team communication is vital to success. We see our throwing trainers, strength trainers, and physical therapists discussing issues on players every day.
So, while it would certainly help to be knowledgeable about all these topics, in the meantime we can encourage more collaboration between people of different backgrounds to work with players.
This is why we closely integrate hitting and pitching movement, strength, and mobility, among others. They all have a stake in a player’s success and should be on the same page of what an athlete’s strengths and needs are to see where he needs to grow.
Interested in training with us? Both in-gym and remote options are available!
I definitely do not believe “old school” philosophy dismissed other important factors in performance.  Mechanics is probably the least important factor for professional athletes… however, for amateurs/ and aspiring professionals it is the foundation from which you build strength, mobility, timing, and mental aptitude. No one seriously believes the two box model you are describing above… love your stuff but your differentiation pitch has to be more credible.
Thanks for reading. We would disagree with your statement that “Mechanics…is the foundation from which you build strength, mobility…”. In our eyes the opposite is true.
Building strength in the weight room and working on targeted mobility feeds into pitching mechanics. Working on mechanics alone doesn’t measurable change strength and mobility in the same way.
Lastly, the comparison was purposefully broad in both the mechanics and multi-variable model to make a point. The point being movement (pitching mechanics) needs to be integrated with strength & mobility as well as other factors.

A Closer Look at the Kettlebell Carry - Driveline Baseball,2018-06-22T02:10:54+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/06/closer-look-kettlebell-carry/,"Recently we released our first peer-reviewed study at Driveline Baseball, titled “Surface Electromyographic Analysis of Differential Effects in Kettlebell Carries for the Serratus Anterior Muscles.” Now, the title is a little long and perhaps challenging to understand specifically what we studied. So with that in mind, let’s take a little time to explain the thought process behind the study and the impact it has had on how we train our athletes.
The Kettlebell Carry (KBC) is an exercise that has been programmed in gym as part of our recovery routine. It’s also one that has typically been performed in myriad ways depending on where you train. Historically, at Driveline we’ve performed them at 90 degrees of horizontal abduction. We wanted to compare the 90 degree position to a new position, approximately 45 degrees. An EMG sensor was placed on the serratus anterior to measure the difference between the two positions.
The serratus anterior serves as a prime mover for scapular upward rotation and a key muscle in scapular stabilization, two components for reducing injury risk and improving rotator-cuff function. It’s also a finicky piece of musculature that tends to lose function in both athletes with pain and those who are symptom free, but don’t move well. For these reasons, we take time after throwing to take care of this muscle in order to keep it functioning properly.
Prior to our study, we could not find literature on what arm position elicits the greatest amount of serratus activation during the KBC. Therefore, the goal of the study was to determine with minimal coaching which KBC position provided the highest amount of serratus anterior activity.
We used two positions: approximately 45 and 90 degrees of horizontal abduction. Our subjects split into two groups and had surface EMG sensors attached to their serratus anterior muscles. Once ready, we had one group perform a 90-degree KBC, take a short break, and then perform a 45-degree KBC. The other group followed the same procedure but in reverse order.
Our results found that the 45-degree KBC produced a significant increase in EMG activity for the serratus anterior in this position compared to the 90-degree KBC. This suggests there’s a better chance of the 45-degree carry impacting serratus function and strength. As a result, during our recovery work at Driveline, we have shifted from using the 90-degree KBC in favor of 45-degree KBC instead.
Also of note from this study is that technique was not heavily coached. This allowed us to see the levels of activation prior to any major technique intervention from a trainer. However, when we coach our athletes, we look for several things:
If you are interested in learning more, read the full in-depth look at the KBC study and the science behind it.
HTKC still has waiter walks at 90 degrees. I’m guessing we should switch this to 45 now?
How long do you carry? Timed or distance?
A good mark for the Kettlebell carry is 40 yards at a normal walking pace.

Two-Way Athletes and Considerations for Long-Term Health - Driveline Baseball,2018-05-08T05:19:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/05/two-way-athletes-considerations-long-term-health/,"According to the Paul Haggen at MLB.com, baseball and softball are the most participated in team sports for youth athletes, with over a combined 25 million participants in 2016 (Haggen 2017). Not only that, but baseball participation has increased 7.7% in 2016 (Haggen 2017). It’s great to see so many young athletes taking part in the game we all love and the sport beginning to offer more opportunities for youths to play. However, an aspect of the youth game often unaccounted for in an athlete’s treatment and development, is the two-way player.
Now, we are primarily talking about youth two-way athletes, but this has credence for the high school and collegiate player as well. Two-way players, are an integral part of the youth game. Often, rosters are limited and games and tournaments abound, which can make developing youth players a unique challenge. Everyone needs to be able to pitch and play the field so the team can compete, and playing multiple positions also helps aid skill development by granting opportunities for athletes to develop at multiple positions.
However, the downside to this is that training economy for youth athletes is often overlooked. Pitch counts and inning limits (on the mound) are instituted in many leagues to help curtail the rise in arm injuries, but there’s very little control over innings played in the field or other measures of workload. There are even horror stories of youth athletes playing as many as 120 games in a calendar year—which is only 20-games less than what a AAA team plays in the regular season and twice as many as most D1 baseball teams.
Admittedly, a 120 games is not the norm for most youth athletes; regardless, there are many things we need to consider when playing and training them.
Since we’ve already mentioned the absurdity of some youth schedules, we’ll begin with scheduling and how it affects the two-way athlete. From a macro look at the schedule, playing year-round has its benefits and drawbacks.
Now, we do not want to open the debate of early sport specialization (youth players should try to play multiple sports), but we do want to illustrate concerns about youth athletes’ health based around playing time and training economy. This is an even greater concern for two-way athletes because of the increased workload placed upon them.
It’s easy to lose sight of the volume of work placed upon these athletes throughout the course of a season. They play just as many games as their peers, but two-way athletes have a higher workload: high-intent throws when pitching and when playing the field, as well as higher volumes of rotation since they’re throwing more and swinging on top of that. At practice, they throw bullpens, shag, run bases, do fielding drills and take bp. There’s just far more work being placed upon two-way athletes that is not always being accounted for. This increase in workload can lead to an increased risk of injury.
Of the injuries youth athletes face, elbow and shoulder complications are fairly well documented, but rotational ones are less talked about. For more on that, our in-house physical therapist, Terry Phillips, has written about the prevalence of stress injuries to the lower back in rotational sports.
The key points to highlight though are that repeated rotation is linked to lumbar-stress injuries and any injury to that area can cause inhibition to the muscular system, resulting in a drop in performance. Drops in performance are clearly bad, but what’s worse is working an athlete to the point of having a stress reaction or stress fracture to the lumbar spine, which is something that potentially can be career ending.
So, if too much rotation can lead to lumbar issues, then that is important to consider with our focus here on two-way athletes. They’re often the ones rotating more than anyone else on the field with the amount of throwing and hitting they do. As coaches, we need to be cognizant of this fact and adjust their schedules appropriately. They may need more time off or they may need to have specific days dedicated to each task in order to limit the amount of rotation we’re placing on their developing bodies.
Not only is the amount of rotation an issue for two-way players, but also the increased levels of fatigue they experience compared to other players can be problematic. Again, in most scenarios two-way athletes put in a significantly larger amount of work when compared to a position-specific athlete. We touched on training economy earlier, but this is a reminder that this work adds up, and those elevated levels of fatigue have been shown to affect pitching mechanics and increase an athlete’s risk of arm injury (Erickson et al. 2016).
The key here is to be proactive. Yes, often the best athletes are two-way players and they’re key to a team’s success, and while winning that 12u championship is a great memory for your athletes to have, this should not come at at the potential cost of their playing careers.
As coaches, we have to be smart about scheduling. If they’re two-way guys, give them a bit more downtime than a specialized-position player. They need it, and it’s the right move to reduce the risk of injury.
The last point to touch on is the importance of strength training for any youth athlete, regardless of whether they’re two way or not. There’s a persistent belief that youth strength training is bad for developing bodies, and many youth athletes don’t train for this reason.
Now, it’s ok to not do strength training at this age, but there are complicating factors. We’ve all seen the parents who think their kid is a D1 superstar or the next Bryce Harper at age 10. They’re living vicariously through their kids and forcing them to play a ton already, and training economy is stretched thin as is.
Remember how we talked about fatigue? Piling more on a greater workload only makes things worse. From an even simpler standpoint, there’s merit to just allowing your kid to play a sport and enjoy it rather than dedicating himself to training at a young age.
However, there’s also merit to a well-structured strength program for youth athletes—especially since the negative effects have been shown to be more myth than fact. The research on the topic has shown that the majority of injuries come from improper use of equipment, lack of supervision, inappropriate weight, or poor technique (Dahab 2009).
With proper structure, there are a lot of positive benefits to such training. Athletes already have to accelerate and absorb forces near to or over their body weight when they run, jump, sprint, swing, and throw. That’s a lot to be able to handle, and it’s a part of why we see some of the injuries that we previously talked about. Getting in the weight room can help young bodies be more prepared to handle those forces. It also helps balance their body out.
For the most part, baseball is a unilateral sport. We’re always rotating one way; we’re always striding one way when we throw a baseball. Over time, these repetitive movements bias certain functional adaptations. While this makes athletes better at performing them, we need to account for this over time, and strength training is a great way to get some of that balance back.
We should not be over exerting youth athletes in the weight room—we’re not going for maximal squats or deadlifts. We just want to begin practicing good movement patterns and working on laying a foundation that will keep them healthy and setup the rest of their career if they choose to pursue baseball past adolescence.
The main takeaway from this is that if you’re coaching two-way athletes, they absolutely must have more rest time. This is non-negotiable. If they’re out on the field everyday throwing, hitting, pitching, playing every inning of every game, and never taking more rest then any of the other athletes, you are putting them at increased risk of injury, regardless of how good or how developed you think they are. They’re still developing, and it’s honestly not worth risking a kid’s career to win a few more games as a middle schooler. Let’s face it, while it is fun at the time, those stats aren’t going to define him getting a college scholarship or drafted as a senior in high school.

A Closer Look at Sport Specialization - Driveline Baseball,2018-05-06T14:49:56+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/05/closer-look-sport-specialization/,"During the draft of every major sporting event, the topic of “sports specialization” is guaranteed to come up. You’ll probably end up seeing plenty of graphics like this:
Undoubtedly, there will be people who point out that many top-draft picks were multi-sport athletes, and because of that, you should be one too!
But should you? The actual answer, as usual, is it depends. There are a number of factors involved in becoming a high-level athlete in any sport, with whether or not to specialize being one of them.
Here we’ll break down some of the nuance around what athletes should do about specializing in baseball.
For the context of this discussion, “youth” athletes refers to athletes under the age of fourteen, or pre high-school. We’ll discuss and refer to other levels later because athletes’ ages and levels matter in the discussing whether or not to specialize. We can think of specialization as narrowing the focus of an athlete to focus on one sport.
We’ve touched on this topic before, but it helps to restate that many statements in favor of multi-sport athletes suggest that a multi-sport athlete is the main criterion for becoming a high draft pick. However, just because these two may seem to correlate, it does not mean that they are related in the way commonly assumed.
“Most pro athletes played multiple sports, therefore specialization is bad.” Reverses cause and effect
In fact, we should be able to acknowledge that better athletes are going to be in highest demand of every sport. At every age group, the athletes who are faster, stronger, throw harder, and rotate well are desired by coaches of all sports. This is especially true of youth athletes because the differences in skill levels among them, and those in early high school, can be drastic.
This means that the better athletes are going to get significantly more opportunities to play multiple sports than others—not to mention the fact that school size plays a role in the opportunities presented to athletes. Just by math alone, it is easier to play multiple sports with a school body of 500 kids compared to a school with 2,500 kids.
The effect of being a good athlete means you get pulled into more sports, it is not the cause
So most of these stats claiming that playing multiple sports leads to high draft picks multi-sport are not being used properly. We should realize that the amount of general athleticism needed to be drafted in any sport is usually incredibly high.
We should also note that certain sports pair much better with each other than others. We can draw many more similarities of ball movement and player position between soccer, basketball and even football than we can between one of them and baseball—not to mention how typical fall sports like soccer, football, and cross country pair very well with a sport like track in the winter and spring.
Now, this doesn’t mean that youth athletes should not play multiple sports, they should. It’s just not great way of getting to that point.
One reason youth athletes should take time off from one specific sport to play another is to give them a mental break from the game. Another reason is to keep amateur sports away from increasing professionalization. For example, we can see that youth sports are now an incredible $15-billion dollar industry.
When specialization is talked about negatively, it is almost always framed in the a way that suggests these athletes are playing their sports competitively year-round. This often blurs the line between specialization and overspecialization.
Playing one sport year-round is often linked to injuries—mainly overuse injuries—which has been an issue for a long time as seen by the date of the New York Times article below:
When specialization is talked about positively, it often acknowledges that these athletes should take time off and train before competing again.
Now, there are some big differences between these two even though you rarely see them distinguished in an argument.
When trying to figure out where an athlete is on the spectrum, we should also ask, Who is driving the specialization? The athlete or parent? There can be a big difference between a parent who pushes for a youth athlete to play one sport and an athlete who decides he doesn’t like playing other sports.
Pressure to be great at a sport, and specialization in that sport, is often tied to the desire to play in college or play professionally.
Playing baseball specifically year-round is not going to be beneficial to an athlete’s development. Yes, athletes will improve by practicing the skills they need to perform in a game, but practice and training are different than playing.
Playing year-round is also closely tied to the politics and pressures of baseball, along with travel teams and the increase in year-round showcases. The perception is that every team and showcase presents one more opportunity to be “seen” by some scout to get that next chance at a scholarship or draft opportunity.
This is half true. Yes, athletes need to be seen to get a chance, but being seen isn’t going to help without skill and talent. Athletes get better by becoming stronger and training better, not playing. At Driveline, we’ve also had multiple athletes get college scholarships or pro contracts based on youtube videos alone, which supports the point that opportunities will present themselves—athletes just have to be really good first.
It can work, but it’s no guarantee. The research suggests the injury risks are certainly higher, which is an important factor to consider.
While there are flaws in the specialization model, we cannot ignore the fact that many Caribbean and Latin American countries greatly prefer specialization and have developed some great baseball players. However, information on burnout rate and injuries is lacking, and we should also point out that the incentives are quite different as well.
We have to acknowledge that practicing or training more will get you better at a specific sport.
That being said, there is still a belief that being better at a younger age will give an athlete an advantage down the road in that same sport. The survey results from a recent study (Brooks et al., 2018) on sports specialization are eye opening:
Contrast those numbers to a different survey study (Wilhelm, Choi & Deitch, 2017) of 102 current professional baseball players that found 48% specialized early, with the mean age of specialization being 8.91 years old. The study also found that those who specialized earlier reported more serious injuries while they were professionals—while 63.4% of the players surveyed believed that early sports specialization was not required to play professionally.
Another factor to consider is that it doesn’t matter how good an athlete is at a sport at the age of 10. It just doesn’t—playing on an fall all-star team, cool travel team, or having a “select invite” to a winter showcase at 10 may be fun, but there is no direct relationship between skill at that age and success in that sport later in life.
Another study (Erickson et al., 2017) found that between 2001 and 2009, 10% of the players in the Little League World Series ended up playing professional baseball—with 6 of the 638 players making the majors. And yet another study (Kearney & Hayes, 2018), looking at track athletes, found similar results: excelling as a youth athlete does not guarantee success later.
So do youths absolutely need to specialize before high school to become professional athletes? No.
What’s more, the downsides to early specialization are mental burnout and injury.
In a 10-year study, ASMI (Fleisig et al., 2011) found that pitchers who pitched more than 100 innings in a year were 3.5 times more likely to be injured. Playing year-round, on multiple teams, with increasingly smaller rosters are all variables that may lead youth pitchers to throwing more innings. This makes it all the more important how coaches run their travel teams.
Those same researchers also found that playing catcher appears to increase a pitcher’s risk of injury. This would suggest that because the gap in talent level in youth baseball is so large, better athletes are more likely to play more demanding positions and thus be at a higher injury risk.
One study (Yang et al., 2014) found no relationship between playing baseball exclusively and injury, but did find that pitching with arm pain and tiredness were associated with an increased pitching risk. There are two things we can take from this.
First, we can assume that playing year-round results in more chances for pitchers to throw with pain or tiredness. Second, like we mentioned above, not all specialization is the same; there are differences between competing year-round and just playing one sport.
So while there can be exceptions to the rule, it doesn’t seem that early specialization is the best way for athletes to reach their goals.
Of course this is still a simple look at the issue. There are underlying issue of teams and players having incredibly varied warm-ups and recovery protocols as well as having drastically different opinions on workload management and lifting. All of this factors into the risk of injuries.
At this point, we’d like to clarify that youth athletes should play multiple sports, because it makes them well-rounded. Different sports require different skills and types of communication to be successful, and it’s good for youths to have this variety. This should never be in question.
It should also be said that whether or not an athlete specializes in high school requires a different perspective from youth athletes. Once athletes hit high school, they should start to re-evaluate a few things to see if specializing in one sport makes sense to meet their goals:
An athlete’s decision to specialize in high school should be determined by his current skill level and what his goals are.
Age and skill are the important points in determining goals, these discussions should continue until a player enters high school and and then be more seriously considered as a player enters sophomore and junior years of high school.
Now, an incoming high-school junior who is an all-state baseball player and has been offered multiple college scholarships is probably fine continuing to play multiple sports.
However, the baseball player starting his junior year who has never been a full time starter but wants to play in college probably needs to make a different decision.
There are only so many top-level talents that we can hold up as examples until we realize that the majority of athletes have average skill sets but similar goals to the best players. Therefore, they need to make different decisions on how to reach those goals.
Pushing high-school athletes to be multi-sports athletes when they want to specialize ignores the fact that the more time athletes can spend training for their sports often means the better they can become. (Notice we said “training,” not “playing.”)
This shouldn’t be too controversial and is similar to the long-term athlete development plan that USA baseball recommends.
If you haven’t seen USA baseball’s long-term athlete development notes, they are worth reading, and this is a good start.
Decisions around specialization need to be considered in high school, but before high school athletes should try playing a variety of sports.
While participating in multiple sports is beneficial for youth athletes, we offer a quick word of caution for those playing multiple sports in high school.
One study looking at sport specialization (Jayanthi et al., 2015) found a strong relationship between specialization and spending more hours in organized sports and injury. Specifically, a high ratio of organized practice in relation to free play was a risk factor. Let’s use a baseball scenario to see how playing multiple sports can restrict free play or rest time.
With the increase of competitiveness in travel baseball, many teams try to lock in their rosters at the end of summer or fall while expecting to compete again the following summer. For teams, this does help them make sure that they have players, but it often comes with fall and winter practices.
This means a three-sport athlete could be playing football in the fall, with “optional” baseball practices on Sundays. This then leads to basketball in the winter and “optional” baseball practices on Sundays, followed by a competitive season in the spring.
Summer doesn’t get any easier. You could technically be in-season for baseball while going to football or basketball camps in the morning. These are potentially huge global workloads for high-school athletes, with very little rest.
Unfortunately, there isn’t an easy answer to these questions. Coaches are competitive as well and want certain players on their teams. This can lead to some awkward but necessary conversations with coaches who tell athletes that they have to go to certain practices or they won’t play.
So, parents and athletes may need to put their foot down and make certain decisions on which sports they are playing, or which practices they can make, earlier than they wish.
How do you keep the specialized baseball player safe? Limit throwing and rotational load.
Being specialized doesn’t mean doing baseball-specific activities 6 days a week. The specialized baseball player needs to be lifting, taking care of mobility work, and everything else that makes a strong foundation. Ideally, these pieces are able to be implemented after a solid assessment.
What is not needed is to play more or try to get better by throwing more bullpens and taking more short flips.
Part of the reason that not specializing in baseball is good for youth athletes is that there is time away from rotating and throwing, which prevents overuse of patterns. It’s not that soccer, basketball, or football have skills that directly relate to being better at baseball; rather they improve general movement skills in youth athletes but they also give rest from throwing and rotating.
But if youth athletes do just want to play baseball, then they need to take adequate time away from throwing and rotating. They should still take significant time off—aim for at least four months off in a calendar year. Parents should also attempt to have two to three of those months off continuously. Remember, athletes need time away from both throwing and from rotating.
The way one-sport athletes can get better at moving, without throwing or rotating, is take the weight room seriously.
After you realize all these forces are already occurring when athletes are practicing, you can see why progressively training to get the body stronger and better at accepting and creating force is a huge benefit.
Lifting for youth athletes doesn’t need to be complicated; it needs to be consistent.
To create and maintain consistency, covering the basic movement patterns and focusing in on technique are the key.
Squat, hinge, push, pull, move laterally, do some fun work. It’s going to involve education and practice.
If an athlete insists on doing baseball work, it should be unstructured. Taking grounders or fly balls can be fine; just don’t have them throwing.
Lastly, these extra baseball activities need to be driven by the athlete, not by the parent or coach.
Here is the biggest piece of actionable advice we can give: parents and athletes need to take time to plan and evaluate what they are doing and when.
Youth and high school athletes and their parents should ask themselves:
Points two and three can be asked for both one sport and multiple.
It best to think of an athlete’s schedule by looking six months back and planning six to twelve months ahead.
This gives you the best chance to get a wide look at things and start planning when athletes are competing, what sports they want to play, when they can take time off to train, and when they have time to rest.
The most important question is not about whether or not to be a multi-sport athlete. It’s what athletes want their careers to be and how far they are willing to go to meet their goals.
There is nothing wrong with playing sports for fun, and there is nothing wrong with setting a high goal in one sport and working towards it. But everyone needs to have a plan.
Athletes should come up with goals and get help from their parents to schedule how they can reach them. Then re-evaluate where they are and then decide on the best path moving forward.
This can be every year for a youth athlete or before a season to see if what sports they are interested in playing. In high school, decisions can be re-evaluated every season because factors in their control, such as skill level, and outside their control, school size and coaches, are going to impact their planning.
Then can then re-evaluate every season and see how, and if, their goals have changed and what they can do to train for them.
There is a lot of nuance in the discussion of sports specialization. We covered a lot of topics, so let’s recap the main points:

Great write up & break down of sport specific training.
Right on the money about issues trying to manage a kid who plays multiple sports and a coach that wants them at the indoor doing baseball stuff 9-10 months a year and possibly playing spring, summer and fall seasons.  When there are kids that want to play the same position and only play Baseball and your kid plays 3 sports, it gets tough to continue down that path when they could/will end up with less playing time because of that.

Player Development: Integration and Communication for Better Results - Driveline Baseball,2018-04-13T00:49:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/04/player-development-integration-communication-better-results/,"Player development is the holy grail of baseball. Velocity, movement, command, injury prevention: the teams that can develop these traits better and faster than others are the ones that will be, theoretically, hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy more often than any others. This doesn’t just play at the major-league level either. In fact, it’s almost more important at the college and high school levels where you can’t just shovel out huge salaries or make a trade to get the pieces you need. At the high school level, you can’t even recruit; you get whoever lands in your school district. This is why player development is so crucial to the success of an organization or team. This is why teams should invest big sums to further their players’ development.
However, that’s not what’s happening for the majority of baseball teams, especially at the affiliated level. This is a problem, because players have particular expectations. Like many others, I believed that if I was good enough to make it to the next level, to play college ball, to just get on an affiliate roster, there would be a coach there who would help me become a better baseball pitcher—because I knew I had more in the tank. Does this sound familiar?
The higher level you get to, the better coaching you believe you must receive. But that’s unfortunately not always the case, which brings us to this quote from a current minor leaguer:
“There is no player development. Teams aren’t adding velocity or any of that, the teams that appear the best at player development are the teams that are the best at not screwing their talent up.”
So, is that what good player development is? Is it just, not getting in the way? Or should it be something more?
First, we need to acknowledge that player development in-season is very difficult. While improvements can be made, development isn’t a primary focus when trying to compete and win baseball games.
Second, it comes down to the offseason—when high school and college players may be playing other sports or working around rules of contact hours, and minor leaguers are looking for another job to make ends meet.
Finally, you get into what players are doing in the off-season. You wonder if everyone is on the same page, especially when when almost thirty percent of all injuries needing surgery occur during spring training (Lindbergh, 2015).
So, if the current model isn’t ideally servicing our athletes, how do we change it? Now, I am by no means privy to all the details of player development in affiliated baseball nor am I aware of what every college and high school is doing around the country. I also realize that every player has their own unique situation and circumstances. However, since I have spent time around major and minor league clubs and coached college baseball for five years, I want to share what I see as some of the biggest issues currently facing true player development.
Any sort of self-help or leadership book almost always talks about communication. Communication as a whole is incredibly important—just ask your significant other; relationships don’t work without communication. However, often and at almost every level, we see a dearth of communication among the skill coaches, strength coaches, and the ATCs. (We won’t even begin to bring the R&D folks into this to keep it simple.) While this is not always the case, more often than not each group is siloed into their own realms and relegated to certain tasks: get them healthy, get them strong, make them throw strikes, etc. These shouldn’t be individual tasks; each group can have a positive impact in a cohesive manner.
This is where, when you really get rolling, true player development begins.
For example, consider a pitcher who’s struggling to throw strikes. The pitching coach works with him, maybe tries some mechanical changes, some drills, but however he chooses to correct it, the player either gets better or he doesn’t. The important part here is that the athlete’s skill development often begins and ends with only the pitching coach. Now, imagine instead the pitching coach takes a look at the struggling pitcher, realizes he has some mechanical inefficiencies with his lead leg, sees there’s a lot of lateral shifting, and knows that it doesn’t seem to brace well. The pitching coach then programs certain drills to improve lead-leg brace and then informs the strength coach and ATC about it as well.
The ATC does an assessment, learns the athlete is lacking internal hip rotation, so no matter how much the pitching coach does, he would have never helped that athlete to block his lead leg and improve his command. However, knowing this, now the ATC begins working to manually increase hip IR, and the strength coach programs mobility and strength work to help strengthen the hip through its newly opened range of motion. The skill coach can continue to help the athlete pattern that movement, while being cognizant of the athlete’s limitations and how he’s progressing his development.
The idea behind this process started when Kyle Boddy and Jack Scheideman took a trip to Altis, where they watched Stuart McMillin, Dan Pfaff, and others provide manual therapy while observing their sprinters’ warm-ups. They used manual therapy to adjust and correct for any movement restrictions they noticed in their athletes. The athletes, knowing their bodies and their “feel” better than anyone else also provided feedback so that the trainers could correctly treat and fine tune the athletes for that day’s workout. Through this simple communication loop, they began to not only bridge the athletes’ development gaps, but also improve their performance, allowing them to be more prepared for that day’s training or competition.
I should also point out that we know this scenario isn’t available for everyone, but it’s important for school coaches to reach out to their ATC and for facility owners to start networking local PTs, ATC, and chiropractors to refer athletes to. The goal is not to have athletes become dependent on treatment, but to provide a means of identifying limitations, treating them, and then putting athletes on a sustainable path that will allow them to be self sufficient through warm-ups and training.
My question then, is, Why are we not doing this with at least bullpen pitchers in baseball? If sabermetrics is telling us that the highest-leverage innings come later in the game, why do we not want these athletes as finely tuned for performance as possible? They often warm up for four hours before the start of the game. Four hours!
Now, that’s not four hours before they pitch; that’s four hours before first pitch. So, tack on another one and a half to two or more hours from there, and you can’t tell me that after getting hot six hours ago things haven’t stiffened back up. Just think about how you feel after sitting behind a desk for a few hours—great right? I doubt it.
So why would you not have a manual therapist working on helping pitchers feel better and become more finely tuned an inning or two ahead of their potential appearances?
While this falls under communication, making an effort to learn terminology and gain knowledge in departments outside of your own not only helps make you a better coach or trainer, but also facilitates ease of communication among groups. For example, if you understand the strength and conditioning concepts of energy systems and training economy, as a pitching coach it can help you better structure practices and coordinate with the strength coach on lifting, recovery, overreaching, and other important training factors required for player development. The same goes for the strength coach, who likely has a good understanding of the movements required for success in the sport but can benefit from understanding the movement and mechanical principles the skill coach is looking to have his athletes perform.
There are other examples of how important it is to know your training staff’s philosophies, what they’re doing to train athletes, and the terminology they use when speaking to athletes in order to make you and your athletes better, so we won’t wear this out. Just remember, the more you know about every aspect of your athletes’ training, the better you will communicate and the better you will be at training them yourself.
This is something I’ve been guilty of and that I’ve seen many smart coaches struggle with as well: it’s ok to share knowledge. It’s ok to let people into your world and to tear down that silo. All too often we feel the need to protect our knowledge. We live and work in a competitive industry and sometimes knowing more than everyone else seems like job security. You’re valued more if you know more, right? As wrong as this is, I’m sure we’ve all worked with others who have had this kind of attitude. Some of them even try to brow beat you over the head with their knowledge.
One major league strength coach I spoke with said he worked with a pitching coach early in his career who used his knowledge of biomechanics to throw other members of his staff under the bus when things went south for his pitchers. That kind of thought process doesn’t contribute to athletic development and success no matter how much you know. Not sharing information and not learning more of what your coworkers’ departments are doing limits you and your team’s ability to impact athletes positively. It also sets up a poisonous work environment. Regardless of how much that coach knew about biomechanics, you can’t tell me he was going to have long-term success. It’s just not possible with that mindset.
This is the last piece of player development we’ll touch on, so let’s set the record straight right away: Feel is not real, and technology is not the answer. You can hate sabermetrics; you can hate Rapsodo and edgertronic cameras. You can believe launch angles are the devil and deny batted-ball exit velocity.
However, the truth is you need these if you want to give your athletes the best opportunities to develop, but remember that these tools are not the answers in and of themselves. They’re simply a means of measuring improvement and providing feedback for quality control. You won’t believe how many athletes think they’re throwing a curveball only to discover on the Rapsodo that they’re actually throwing a 30% spin efficiency crappy cutter. While it may even look moderately ok to the eye, for some reason it keeps getting tattooed for doubles in the gap. Like it or not, the technology is there to help understand the why of what is happening.
But as I said, technology alone is not the answer, it needs a good coach to be able to interpret the data and communicate it to his athletes. You can’t just use the Rapsodo and edgertronic cameras to develop a new pitch if you don’t understand seam orientation, spin axis, spin rate, etc. A good coach provides feedback and suggestions based on an athlete’s feedback (i.e. feel) and data from the technology, and the same goes with hitting and using a Rapsodo or anything else you do. Regardless of the task or environment, there’s a necessity of having a coach there to discuss feel and direction; we just want to use whatever technology it is to help aid that process. It’s not meant to take over the process and it certainly isn’t there to replace a coaching staff. Instead, it should empower them to better own their athletes’ development.
Don’t be afraid of data and technology—baseball is going to the nerds and for good reason. They’re finding ways to analyze the game like never before, and this means more opportunities to understand the game and make your players better. Don’t run from it; embrace it, because players will always need coaches to show them the way and if you’re willing to look, the way forward is starting to have much better signs to guide us.
In closing, I just want to reiterate that for organizations and teams to experience peak player development, there needs to be communication. You can buy all of the technology you want, you can throw weighted balls, you can have the best, most educated coaching staff in the country, but if you’re not fully integrated with every department, if you don’t utilize your strength coaches, skill coaches, and ATCs to best of their abilities, you’re missing huge opportunities to develop your athletes.
We need everyone discussing what they’re seeing and sitting down together to formulate development plans with their athletes. It doesn’t matter if an athlete struggles with exit velocity, command, health, etc, everyone can have an impact on improving each athlete’s development. This is one of the reasons we’ve been so successful at Driveline. The more we’ve integrated all aspects of our floor into one, the better results we’ve seen, and the lower our injury rates have been.
So, let’s breakdown the silos. It’s time for a better age of player development where we don’t just avoid screwing talent up, we take talent and make it great.

I believe that your Research department should implement another aspect of assessment in pitching recovery in the form of MuscleSound. It will help to assist your team in analyzing how muscles recover after throwing and how much fuel or energy the muscles need to achieve optimal muscle size and composition.  Which to me means once the athlete is assessed with the Muscle Sound protocol then that athlete has a baseline fuel level. Then keep track of his fuel level( protein, water levels, nutrition) every 2-3 days and monitor his velo with his muscle recovery and fuel levels. The program is simple to use.  Plus  at driveline you have a steady sample size of pitchers   A university would have the same sample size. Meaning more pitchers or throwers to assess and be able to monitor and get to optimal performance. My hunch is this: if a pitcher is dominating at every start and throwing 95-98 or even. 88-93… but only lasts 4-5 starts then hits a dead period.  Could it be that the Muscle Fuel levels are low and we do not even know? Meaning If we track muscle fuel levels and compare with actual performance is there a correlation.  Could this information help each athlete ? Help each pitcher get better? Help an underdeveloped pitcher get better? I think so. After all what could it hurt? I have a Muscle Sound but really do not have access to constant athletes. Use it more for post op patients and work related injuries. But this seems to be the missing link in recovery and management of velo for pitchers after or during throwing. I have no finanacial interest in Muacle Sound but they are based in Denver Colorado and way to reach. From there I feel like Droveline can set up a protocol very easily with some outstanding conclusions that could change the way PTs., ATC  and MD and pitching organizations look at development. Why not be the pioneer ? Also could be done with hitters and any throwing athletes . The people who implement the MuscleSound can all be trained.  The software for each assessment is easy to read and is cloud based.
Integrating MuscleSound imaging of all athletes (pitchers and hitters) on a regular basis will provide an area of research for Driveline that is missing.  The correlation of muscle health ( fuel and composition) with velocity gains. I have a Muscle Sound imaging decision cue that I use on my patients and a small amount of athletes ( my son is a high school pitcher). So what I want to know is how is fuel levels correlate with his velo and what will his velo be when his fuel levels ( energy ) is full. I have been doing this for 3 weeks and his current fuel stays is low A compared to national norms and to his contrlateral side. So if he is at 29% fuel capacity now and throwing 87-91 as a 17 year old what will he be throwing at full capacity. How long do W.A. or take him to replenish his muscle fuel after he pitches a complete game.   These are all viable questions that can help everyone. I would like to see Driveline start to include this data with their research. It is easy to implement and the learning curve is easy. The tech savvy people who can scan the muscles are needed but a trainer or PT can easily do this. Muscle Sound is in Denver Colorado and easily accessed online for information.
We are open to the idea, but it is cost-prohibitive and the device lacks the open source support we require for our workload tracking integration. If the cost came down and the device/data was opened more, we would strongly consider it.

"Assessments, Data, and Individualization - Driveline Baseball",2018-03-09T03:28:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/03/assessments-data-individualization/,"Individualization is seen as a must have with training programs. While this is good, it doesn’t come without some misunderstandings. We’ve touched on some of those issues before, but it sometimes seems like people get confused by what individualization means in relation to sports.
At times, individualization is treated in the sense that all players have to have a training program that is entirely unique to them, and only them, one that is brand new and never seen before—except that doesn’t always make a lot of sense.
In reality, good individualization shouldn’t be a program that completely starts from scratch, with everything new. Rather, it should be one based on sound principles and then tweaked based on assessment in order to better tailor to the needs of the athlete. This should happen for lifting, throwing, and hitting programs.
Train at Driveline
A simple example comes from a lifting program. Each program should be able to cover the basic movement patterns: squat, hinge, push, and pull. But how each athlete does that is subject to change based on the particular characteristics each athlete has.
Maybe one athlete’s body is more conducive to the front squat than the back squat. Maybe he’s had back issues and bilateral squats (front and back) irritate his spine, but single leg work doesn’t. All of these changes fall under individualization and should come from a quality assessment at the beginning of the training process.
Baseball specifically has a significant amount of data in the game—nearly everything is tracked. This gives players and coaches a unique advantage to assess specific skills and then create programs built upon that information.
There are many misconceptions with the data revolution in baseball, many coaches feel as though the technology is intended to replace them, which isn’t true. There will be no winner between a battle of technology or coaching, but it also isn’t a battle that needs to be fought. The best teams will simply be the ones that integrate technology with coaching.
The worst uses of technology are the ones with no action, which is more common than not, and is probably why many dislike it. Spin rate, exit velocity and launch angle metrics with no ability to understand or know how to develop players off it is a waste. But those who disregard the data as a challenge to their current coaching concepts will be passed over by those who use it to their advantage.
Much of the technology now available gives coaches and players the opportunity to answer questions that people have been unable to answer.
Technology and the data it produces isn’t going to replace coaching. It’s going to fill in the gaps and supplement the knowledge a coach already has.
The best teams and coaches will be a blend of technology and coaching making the player development process more precise. The use of data in a formal and continuous fashion means that we can consistently assess our athletes to individualize programs to help them improve. Below we are going to look at how we can use information from assessments to individualize programming.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
We see assessment as a multi-part process. At our facility we have formal assessments every four weeks. There is a straight mobility check, a look a strength, and a look at either hitting or pitching movement.
Formal assessments serve the purpose of seeing if the pieces of the training program that are inserted to individualize and help an athlete with a skill are working.
This goes beyond watching a player train or play on a day-to-day basis. It’s a time to take a step back and get a look at how all the pieces of a training program are working together.
Many times there are “issues” that coaches see in a player’s hitting or pitching mechanics, and they try to cue them into better habits. This isn’t going to work if the player isn’t moving a certain way because he isn’t mobile enough or stable enough to hold that position.
Too often pitching and hitting are discussed in a vacuum that neglects strength and conditioning or mobility aspects.
This is why the first part of an assessment, for us, covers these measurables: mobility and strength.
We’re looking at range-of-motion and how an athlete moves under load, which gives us an idea of not only movement quality but also strength and power.
This can then be paired with a performance assessment by getting on the mound and watching a player throw, looking at movement quality with video, which does have his limitations, or reviewing biomechanics with either the Motus sleeve or a biomechanics lab—all while collecting velocity, spin rate, and pitch-movement characteristics.
This is where technology and data fit in so well to the assessment process. They are simply more specific measurements of the things that coaches are seeing day in and day out.
Doing all of these things gives us a detailed look at where a player is currently, so we can pinpoint the areas that need to improve. Each player is going to lift, do mobility work, and throw. But collecting this data allow us to take those areas and tweak them specifically to someone’s needs.
This goes beyond watching a pitcher throw and say that they move well enough or they look good. There are now measurables to aim for to keep an athlete healthy and improve their performance on the field.
Throwing programs can take many forms depending on age, skill set, and the season that the pitcher is in. If we focus in on the off-season, we can see the variety of ways programming can go for an athlete. But it’s important to realize that the throwing programs change because of the assessment process, paired with playing, training, and injury history.
What if velocity and strength are low? Probably this means it’s the best time for a lower-volume throwing with more of an emphasis in the weight room in order to build up a strong foundation of strength.
What if velocity is low but strength is high? This is a good time for more velocity-specific throwing work or velocity based training in the weight room.
What if there’s poor movement quality on the mound? Work specifically with Plyo Ball ® to remap your arm action, while working on getting stronger and more mobile in the weight room.
Good velocity but not strong in the weight room? Time to get your strength up to par.
What if they’ve got good velocity and are strong in the weight room? This either means that specific command work is needed or more pitch design work to improve other pitches.
The point is all of these are skills: velocity, command, and strength, which means that they can be improved. That’s why getting accurate measurements to see specifically where pitchers are can be so beneficial.
There is no better example for what technology can do to improve player development than pitch design.
In today’s day and age, there is no reason for a player to enter college or pro ball, be told that what he needs to do to get to the next level is to develop an offspeed pitch and not be able to get immediate feedback while working to improve one.
Every player and coach has spent time working on an offspeed pitch and then waiting days or weeks to see how it does in a game before tweaking a grip or cue again. There is immense value is shortening the time it takes by getting spin rate readings on a device like the Rapsodo and seeing how the ball comes out your hand with an high-speed camera.
Hitting has similar themes to pitching.
If an athlete needs to hit the ball harder, he is going to spend time working on his swing, but he is also going to need to get comfortable in the weight room.
If there are mechanical issues that need to be addressed, look at doing specific mobility work and using weighted bats and other constraint drills.
If an athlete has trouble catching up to high velocities, it’s good to be practicing hitting 92. If there’s trouble with offspeed pitches, practice hitting offspeed pitches.
This is also where measuring exit velocity and launch angle come in. Yes, certain hitters can overhaul their swing to hit the ball harder and at a higher launch angle. But they can also improve both of those metrics by becoming more consistent and getting less mis-hits.
There is a different process when you have a hitter who already hits the ball hard compared to one that needs to hit the ball harder and at a better angle.
It isn’t the technology or data itself that makes that choice, it’s the coach looking at the numbers and communicating with the player what the steps are to get to the next level.
All of these come down to assessment—seeing where an individual is at, then specifically looking at what each needs to improve on in order to get better.
The benefit of having a data-centric approach is that assessments can be continuous.
On top of the formal assessments, the data we collect during training, plus the time watching our athletes, train also works as an assessment.
Velocity days track throwing progress just like HitTrax can track exit velocity and launch-angle progress.
Even though these numbers can be incredibly valuable, there is often push back on how they should be used, or if they should be used at all.
One of the most unusual things about coaches and players not seeing the positives for certain metrics is that many of them simply describe what occurred: exit velocity, launch angle, spin rate, pitch movement, and even pitch velocity are all descriptions of what occurs.
They aren’t a new way of coaching. They just describe what happens. It’s up to the coaches and players to decide the best way to make a change or if change is needed at all.
We now have an unbelievable opportunity to measure what previously couldn’t be measured. So not only do we know what the better players do when they are successful, but we can measure where an individual player is and work on getting him to the next level.
All the data that can be taken in during an assessment, or tracked during training, is simply more information to better supplement good coaching.
Good coaching should be able to take the information of where that player is and help him work towards where he wants to be.
Pitch velocity and spin rate are valuable to a pitcher because they tell us more about how he should pitch. It’s no secret that faster pitches are harder to hit—that’s just math. All a radar gun does is give you a concrete idea of where you are. Getting spin-rate data from a Rapsodo can tell a pitcher how to use his fastball, and it can give much more specific information on how to improve other pitches.
Every hitter wants to get hits, so understanding how hard and where he is hitting the ball is going to be valuable information. Then, understanding what the players better than him are doing is going to give him goals to aim for.
Many of the counter-arguments against these metrics come linked to some sort of hitting or pitching philosophy, which is where the problem comes in. People do not understanding that the numbers have value in their own right, or they misunderstand or misinterpret what they mean.
Coaches can take that data and use it as a goal to work the player towards. How do you get there? Good coaching, that’s how. Coaches are going to need to take the data and do whatever they need to do to get the players to reach those numbers.
Doesn’t matter what cues, doesn’t matter the drills, just get the players from where they are now closer to their goals.
We now know more about professional players now than we did years ago, and that knowledge should be used to help develop players. We aren’t aiming for a certain batting average, because we now know: the best hitters hit the ball more often at X MPH and at Y Launch Angle, so those are the goals we need to reach to be better.
If I’m only going to get a hit three or four times every ten at-bats, then I should train to get as many hits at X exit velocity and Y launch angle to maximize the value of them.
The data collected during the training period feeds into the information we can gather from a formal assessment, gathering a more complete picture.
Both pitching and hitting are incredibly difficult, so the more information you can get to learn more about just one piece of the puzzle is incredibly beneficial.
It’s not technology and data vs. coaching. Technology and data can fill in the gaps of what players and coaches have been trying to figure out forever. The average coach intuitively knows more about the game than any number can tell him.
But the best coaches are going to be the best translators. Being able to take the data and communicate it to an athlete so they both understand where they are now, and where they need to be.
The clear advantage goes to the coaches who can build relationships and communicate what players need to do to improve while using data to track progress.
Coaches know the players best and know how they can get the message across, each athlete is different so the best coaches will be able to match the data to the player in a way that they can understand.
Having a good formal-assessment process means that your program will have individualization baked into it. Assessments drive programming, meaning you meet each player where they are and then give them goals to improve on.
Measuring all of these pieces isn’t the end all be all, because of course we all want athletes to perform best in a game situation. What measuring these data points does is gives you a much clearer picture of how a player can develop and that’s the next stage of the game.

Coaches Series: Year-Round Programming - Driveline Baseball,2017-12-21T04:56:02+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/12/coaches-series-year-round-programming/,"This post from our Coaches Series was written by Justin James, Assistant Coach at University of California, San Diego. He took over there in January 2017, having coached the previous seven seasons at Point Loma Nazarene University.
In previous posts, I covered implementing Driveline Protocols to a new staff only 30 days before first pitch, then followed with a Season Recap on how the implementation was a success. In this post I will cover year three of fall ball with my staff using Driveline WBs and Plyo Ball ®.
As pitching coaches, or any collegiate coach for that matter, we dread the breaks. During summer and Christmas break, per NCAA rules, we are not to monitor or control our staff regardless of safety concerns or how much better they want to get. That said, a solid, detailed plan broken up into “phases” must be easy to follow and easy to test for when your staff gets back from breaks without supervision.
With this in mind, teaching and allowing for self-awareness and accountability is beyond crucial.
Sometimes this leads to small setbacks, but it’s a necessity if you want a year-round pitching plan to actually be followed. Staff must be tested regularly and scheduled with consistency so complacency doesn’t set in with your guys.
Before each new “season”(start of fall, end of fall, return from Christmas, near end of season), a testing or baseline must be administered. This is for accountability, motivation, health, and the overall excitement of seeing ups and downs of developing. Keeping a track record of testing numbers is a great way to make sure your pitching program is heading in the right direction, and it’s also a great way to look for improvements with individual pitchers and the staff as a whole.
Once back from break, I always administer a WB testing session in week one, followed by Plyo Ball ® testing in week two. (This can be flipped or mixed at your discretion.) New members to the staff really enjoy this time because it gives them the competition element to training that was, for the most part, missing during the summer months.
This helps show gains, pitchers’ work ethic during the “off” months, and helps create their range velo-wise to accomplish recovery, hybrid, and high-output days. Without a baseline, they may not know what their difference is between hybrids and recovery days; this allows for more consistency and in return keeps them safer.
Not all arms are on the same summer or “off season” plan. Some go to summer ball and throw different amounts, and some stay home to train for various reasons. This particular year, we had new guys coming in playing summer ball and returners pitching all the way into August. I decided with these guys to train them differently than the rest of the staff.
I just let the new staff members pitching in summer ball pitch without trying to remotely train them for safety and over-training purposes. However, I provided example videos and articles to help them understand the process they would be doing once September training began; I said watch the videos a few times and read the “Why.” I personally felt more comfortable in this particular approach.
Returners that threw a ton over the summer and calendar year would not pitch off a mound for at least a month once they came back; they would be on a recovery and on-ramping plan until the middle of October. They trained like the offseason guys, were tested several times, and did a variation of the summer plan but not as extensive or intensive because of the short fall time frame and need to face hitters. Notably, these guys already had been in the program and very comfortable with the process, so they were technically in maintenance mode all summer long, so the gap wasn’t too large to implement this plan.
Strength and movement patterns are extremely vital in the fall. Getting on the same page with your strength guy and knowing each other’s plans is invaluable. That’s where we made huge improvements this year. Our Strength and Conditioning coach, Jon Gregory, has been unbelievable in implementing our plan, and he takes the time to learn what we are doing from the pitching side. We had a few sit-down sessions where we discussed what to look for pattern wise, our daily drills, conditioning, etc. We tried to line up our “recovery” days better on both the throwing and lifting sides. This worked out great. It helped me not over train our guys, which at times I might have. I didn’t have to condition guys like in the past, because I know what I wanted was already being done in the weight room. This fall was the least amount I have ever conditioned my pitching staff, and I feel way better with the overall approach. I would still do my staple conditioning drills but with less volume and more intensity, allowing for more recovery and corrective-style exercises (with limited NCAA hours per week, this helped greatly).
Our fall consisted of five days per week. Here are some of the results from the beginning of fall and the end of fall Plyo Ball ®-testing numbers:
In-game velocities were recorded and will be compared once the season starts for a more accurate reading, especially from the returners. Notably, many of the returners had gains, but not as massive as some of our new members. This is typical because they have been improving for over a year and gains will take even more work going forward. (This is explained in HTKC.)
Here is what occurred during the fall (the first time facing live hitters/last intra-squad). Sixteen pitchers threw in both first and last intra-squad. Pitchers usually have a small increase with adapting to the fall’s demands, in both throwing and in the weight room. I am pleased with these numbers:
All great changes worth anything take time. Sure, some instant results do occur from time to time, because simply cleaning up habits, movement patterns, and behaviors can help someone that was deficient in those areas. I mention that because this fall I made some minor tweaks to the fall program, and it’s too early to see if they were the root cause for the improvement within the staff. Our testing numbers jumped significantly, so everything is recorded to make sure a better plan is put forth every season.
Here are a few obvious changes we’ve done that many of you may already do in some degree or another:
I hope everyone has a great break and end to their fall. I highly recommend re-reading and sharing with your staff some of the new material in the updated HTKC. It’s well done, and it allows you to very easily communicate your intentions to your staff using the resources provided with the book/program.

Minimum Protein Needs Based on the Season - Driveline Baseball,2017-12-12T05:27:36+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/12/protein-needs-based-season/,"In our previous post, we laid the groundwork for understanding how much protein baseball athletes should consume. This time, we will determine the differing needs for macronutrients based on the time of the year and examine how best to consume adequate protein throughout the day. Let’s begin with the yearly plan for baseball players, looking at the season and off-season for professional athletes, college athletes, high school athletes, and gap year athletes.
A reasonable belief is that during the season (competitive period), athletes require the most protein. This is not the case. The competitive period is actually when athletes require the least amount of protein. The most protein is required during the off-season, when their training volume is the highest. During the season, it is more important to focus on fueling athletic performance and eating only enough protein to support recovery and maintain the hard-earned muscle from the off-season. Athletes should eat the most protein during the off-season to support lean-muscle gain. Outlined below is the approximate grams of protein needed based on the period of training.
The two categories that are necessary to understand are the competitive period and off-season training period. The competitive period requires 1.3-1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. This is enough to fuel and recover from competition. The off-season training period is when there is less emphasis on sport-specific training and more on strength training and conditioning. During this type of training, it is important for athletes to eat between 1.6-1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. (The table converts pounds to kilograms, so you don’t have to do the math.)
For example, a 190-lb. (86 kg) athlete needs to eat 112-130 grams of protein during the season to maintain lean muscle and to recover from athletic competition. During the off-season, that same athlete needs to eat between 138-155 grams of protein per day to aid in recovery from heavy weight-training sessions. A sample meal plan is given below.
In the previous article, we discussed that there are different amino acids: essential and nonessential. It’s crucial to understand the importance of getting all 9 essential amino acids. Eating protein in the form of animal meat is the safest bet. Animal meats like steak, chicken and fish are packed with 2-3 grams of the amino acid leucine (and all 8 of the other essential amino acids). Leucine is critical for stimulating muscle-protein synthesis, which is how the body builds new lean mass and keeps the existing lean-muscle mass running optimally.
These numbers should be seen as minimums requirements for athletes, who can then adjust based off their response to their diet.

Protein Requirements for Athletes - Driveline Baseball,2017-12-06T05:39:52+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/12/3-protein-requirements-athletes/,"Before we talk about how much protein players should be consuming, let’s talk about what exactly protein is, why it is essential, and what is does for the body. The word “protein” comes from a Greek word meaning “of prime importance.” Proteins are made up of the following elements:
Nitrogen in protein accounts for one of the biggest differences between proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Proteins are all made up of 20 different amino acids, known as the building blocks of protein, and the human body can synthesize an estimated 10,000-50,000 proteins from those 20 amino acids.
Think of the alphabet as the amino acids and the words that you form from letters as proteins. Of the 20 amino acids, there are 9 that are considered essential and 11 that are considered nonessential. The body can synthesize the 11 nonessential amino acids in sufficient quantities, so they are not considered a dietary requirement. However, the 9 essential amino acids cannot be produced in the body in sufficient quantities to meet the body’s needs making it important to consume those 9 essential amino acids as part of a regular diet.
In order for bodies to build and repair muscle, it is important to consume all 9 of the essential amino acids to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Consumed proteins are denatured in the stomach. (“To denature” is just a fancy word for digestion.) Denaturation can also happen when proteins are exposed to heat, like when you crack an egg into a hot frying pan and the egg whites change from a clear jelly to a firm white color.
Consuming enough caloric energy is important to stimulate muscle growth and repair. If an athlete is not eating enough calories from fat or carbohydrate, then his body will use amino acids as energy rather than for building muscle.
Incomplete proteins do not contain all 9 essential amino acids. Some examples are those found in plants and grains. Some plants and grains are rich in the amino acids that others lack, so it is possible to form a complete protein source by eating certain incomplete protein combinations. Complete proteins, on the other hand, have sufficient amounts of all 9 essential amino acids. Animal meat like chicken, steak, or fish are all great sources of complete proteins.
The body needs to be in a positive nitrogen balance in order to build muscle. But, what exactly is a nitrogen balance? There are three nitrogen balance situations that can occur in the body:
Since a neutral nitrogen balance is ideal, how do we get there? The recommended daily allowance for protein for the general population is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. This roughly equals 114 grams for a 200-lb. person. We are not considering the general population, though. In order to determine the protein needs of a baseball player, we need to understand the demands placed on the body of baseball athletes.
Baseball is a ground-based, intermittent-power sport. A baseball swing or a pitcher’s wind-up requires a large burst of energy over a short period of time. In order to be as strong and as powerful as possible, it is crucial to train for power both in practice and in the weight room. In order to fuel muscle to perform and recover, it is recommended that a power athlete consume 1.3-1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For a 200-lb. athlete, this looks like 118-164 grams of protein. That’s a pretty large window, and which side of that window a baseball player should be on changes based on what phase of training or competition he is in.
In our next discussion, we will examine varying needs in protein intake based on training season. We will also take a look at how to eat that much protein in one day.

Carbs or Fats for Athletes - Driveline Baseball,2017-12-02T04:04:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/12/carbs-fats-athletes/,"“Should I eat carbs or should I eat fat?”
This question has been a topic of hot debate recently, with very credible arguments on both sides. On one hand, we can consider the “right” answer for the general population, which is to probably take it easy on the sugar. However, when we consider the performance and athletic side of things, it is important to note that eating a diet that contains zero carbohydrates may not be the correct answer.
Fat is the most energy-dense macronutrient of the three macronutrients. (Carbohydrate, Fat, Protein.) Carbohydrate and protein each have four calories per gram, whereas fat has nine calories per gram. Fat is the major source of energy when the body is at rest. Fat metabolism is also the predominating source of energy during endurance exercise.
There are many crucial roles that fat plays in the body, some of which include the following:
Fats in the diet also play a role psychologically. Having fat in our food provides some wonderful flavors and textures that we, as humans, really enjoy. Fat also helps give us a feeling of fullness after a meal. Since fat plays so many major roles in the body, it is important to have some in our diet.
Carbohydrates are a major source of energy for activities that are short and intense in nature. Take a pitcher throwing a ball or a hitter sprinting to second base as an example. Without getting into too much detail on energy metabolism and the complex equations that explain it, let’s consider an example. If you ate pancakes for breakfast before the game (or the night before), your muscles have turned them into glucose to be used by the body in order to power the muscle contraction that propels you into a full sprint. (It’s not important to the conversation right now but creatine phosphate also plays a role here.)
Although clearly important for athletic performance, carbohydrates are not essential. We can function just fine without carbohydrates in our diet after getting used to it. That being said, I don’t recommend that any power athlete should restrict carbohydrate intake. The performance decrease is too large for someone who is carbohydrate adapted to make it worth depleting glycogen stores and committing only to getting energy from fats.
To truly optimize athletic performance, a baseball player should eat a diet that has plenty of protein, adequate carbohydrate intake, and enough fat. The combination of all of these macronutrients is enough to keep the body running at its best and will help athletes to train and compete harder.
This article was written by Driveline Strength Trainer Gabe Juarez
In the long run adapting to Fat instead of Carbohydrates, as energy usage, will be most optimal for athletes. Equal amounts Fat and Protein to allow the body to process the protein on the cellular level. Not enough fat and the protein will just turn into sugar. That’s why protein shakes are unfortunately a poor source of nutrients. Not enough fat.

Central Nervous System and Fatigue - Driveline Baseball,2017-11-16T03:00:19+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/11/central-nervous-system-fatigue/,"What is central nervous system (CNS) fatigue, and how will it affect the performance of my baseball athletes?
Most athletes know what central nervous system (CNS) fatigue is because at some point or another they have experienced it. Athletes are constantly subjected to the coaching staff’s great ideas, which usually include some version of individual practice, team practice, team weights, and team conditioning. All of these can cause great gains in athletic performance, but without proper programming and periodization, it is possible for athletes to become overtrained and experience CNS fatigue.
Currently, the widely accepted standard is to wait until performance takes a hit and then try to do something about it. However, this is a classic example of too little, too late. For example, consider monitoring and recording a pitcher’s throwing velocity or a hitter’s exit velocity off the bat. When the numbers dip too low, it’s time for a de-load week, but at that point, it is too late and misses the mark by a lot. What do we do about this?
The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord. For athletes, that system can become “tired” when it starts to have trouble communicating with the muscles of the body. CNS fatigue doesn’t happen when the muscles become tired, and not when the brain or spinal cord becomes tired, but when the communication between the two wears out. Overtraining can cause decreased performance, but also greatly increases the risk of injury. At the point of overtraining, the body has so effectively adapted to chronic stimulation of a certain variety that it no longer needs to adapt. It is enough to constantly wear athletes down but not enough to cause any actual performance increase.
The way the CNS and the muscles communicate is through neural connections, the neurons synapse with one another by way of neurotransmitters. The four that we will briefly consider are serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, and acetylcholine.
Changes in the concentrations of these synaptic neurotransmitters cause central nervous system fatigue. Here are some of the symptoms of what this looks like: First, acute fatigue comes as a result of a training stimulus. Either no effect or an increase in performance is usually noted at this point. If the training stimulus is too high for too long, then a cascade of events can follow. Functional overreaching can cause a temporary decrease or a return to an athletic-performance baseline. This plays an integral role in the training of athletes. The performance professional can manipulate variables to cause a desired adaptation, but beyond this comes nonfunctional overreaching. This is marked by a stagnation or a decrease in athletic performance. The last phase is when overtraining syndrome is present and causes a decrease in athletic performance. It is marked by significantly decreased force production, glycolytic capacity, and is often concomitant with sickness and infection as well as emotional and sleep disturbances.
(Haff, Triplett ’16)
It is (usually) impossible to look at an athlete and say: “You look like you are a little short on acetylcholine and high in cortisol (hormone associated with stress) today. We should adjust your training.” So how exactly can we assess the recovery status of an athlete?
Using methods for monitoring recovery from athletic training and competition can decrease this risk. One method is to use a mechanical analysis of a countermovement jump (CMJ) in order to determine neuromuscular fatigue. In trained athletes, the jump height remains largely unchanged when the athlete is fatigued, but the way the jump is performed changes depending on the recovery status. If the athlete is fatigued, then he changes the pattern of the movement to decrease the duration of the jump and increases the eccentric utilization of the movement. The peak power and jump height, however, remain fairly constant whether fatigued or recovered from exercise. Another way to measure an athlete’s recovery from exercise is by measuring heart-rate variability (HRV).
Heart-rate variability (HRV) is the measurement of time between heartbeats rather than simply the number of heartbeats in a given time period. HRV relates directly to the autonomic nervous system activity. The “branches” associated with the autonomic nervous system are the parasympathetic nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system.
HRV seems to be a good snapshot indicator of which one of these systems is more active: the parasympathetic, rest-and-digest system, or the sympathetic, fight-or-flight system. Generally speaking, the higher variable the heart rate is, the less stress the athlete is experiencing, and vice versa. A higher HRV indicates that the individual is in a state of recovery from training. A practical application of HRV monitoring is to identify the time with which an individual recovers fully from exercise and adjusting training accordingly.
Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing CNS fatigue. Proper nutrition around the workout is very important. For most athletes, a carbohydrate and protein drink is recommended before training, and a protein shake is recommended after training to assist in fueling and recovering from exercise. As important as pre- and post-workout nutrition is, it cannot replace proper nutrition and fueling during the rest of the day. It is important for athletes to eat a diet high in protein in order to aid in recovery from intense training. The diet must also have fat and carbohydrates in order to fuel activity. Carbohydrates are used in the body to fuel short bursts of high-intent activity. Fats are used to fuel lower intensity activity over longer periods of time. Carbohydrates primarily fuel an athlete sprinting from home to second, but fats keep him going in the ninth inning after he has been on the field for three hours.
Proper programming is essential. Forcing an athlete to throw 120 pitches and do a high-volume weight-training program in one week is a recipe for disaster and diminished performance.
It is crucial that when the volume of throwing or hitting is high for the volume in the weight room to be reduced. The opposite is also true. More is better is hardly true. In order for athletes to have long and successful careers, they must stay healthy and constantly perform well. This is why these variable are so important to consider.

"The What, Why, and How of Deloading - Driveline Baseball",2017-11-15T03:10:40+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/11/the-what-why-and-how-of-deloading/,"I’m not sure if it’s the semi-persistent ringing of the age-old mantra, “No pain, no gain!”, or just a belief that always doing less is a bad thing, but the word “deload” tends to be a borderline dirty word to some athletes and coaches. It shouldn’t be.
Deloads are a necessary part of training and a piece that may help athletes take their training even further. How? Let’s start with the basics.
Deloading is a period of reduced volume and/or intensity. It’s a time to promote recovery and restoration for the body and allow it to prepare for the next phase of training. Deloading is not a period of pure inactivity. It is not a time to sit on the couch and eat ice cream; athletes are doing a little less training than usual. By dropping a set or taking a few pounds off core lifts, the body is allowed to recover from the intensity of training.
A more recovered body is more likely to move bigger weights, which means improved performance during training—and improved performance is what we’re all after right? Right. Deloading works on the principle of supercompensation: start at a baseline level of strength, apply a training stimulus to the body for a period of time, then recover from it, and a new baseline level of strength will be higher, and the next block of training starts there.
But what if athletes don’t feel beat up and sore from their lifts? They will, eventually, if they’re participating in any sort of program that provides a training stimulus. Overtime, that stimulus adds up and their bodies will feel it. We want to stay ahead of that. By regularly having a deload period, athletes avoid falling into those detrimental states of demotivation while also reducing the risk of injury. What’s more, we even limit periods of plateau. By fluctuating the training stress, the body gets a new stimulus and that jump starts adaptation, which, more often than not, results in strength building faster than if the athlete had continued to train.
Implementing a deload is the easy part, and we’ve already hit on it. Reduce the volume and/or intensity of the training. If an athlete did four sets of back squats this month, drop it to three sets. If our athletes deadlifted at their working three-rep max for four sets, we’ll scale the intensity back and maybe even drop a set too if they’re feeling really poor. But like I said, this is the easy part. The hard part is knowing when to deload.
Every athlete is different, and everyone responds to training stimulus in different ways. At Driveline, we deload throwing and lifting on the fourth week of every training block. Why? The general window of needing a deload for most athletes tends to be in that four-to-six week window. Not all athletes fall into this, but the majority do, and I’d much rather deload a little earlier than necessary, rather than push a guy too far and have him plateau or feel beat up and unable to perform at optimal levels.
Like I said earlier, the goal is to improve performance. So, do your athletes’ bodies a favor. If you have them crushing training, but aren’t adding in a deload week, do it. Their bodies and performance will thank you.

Exploring Causes of Decreased Hip Mobility - Driveline Baseball,2017-10-20T05:27:05+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/10/exploring-causes-decreased-hip-mobility/,"One of the most common goals I hear from the athletes I work with at Driveline Baseball is the desire to improve their hip mobility. Since proper range of motion in the hips is associated with improved performance and decreased risk of injury, this is a great goal to have (4, 5). In my experience, complaints of hip tightness can have an actual, measureable restriction on range of motion, or athletes can have a “normal” range of motion but still experience tightness in their hips.
Searching across the internet produces a variety of results on why hips can become restricted and the fixes for them. However, I want to share the reasons that I’ve found as to why athletes complain of decreased hip mobility. Not every athlete falls into one of these categories, and if they do, it does not mean that there are not other possible factors—listed here or not.
Hip mobility is complex, and at the end of the day, some athletes may need to go seek a healthcare or strength and conditioning professional to help them achieve their goals. That being said, let’s take a look into possible factors contributing to this problem.
First, and probably the most easily identified factor is actual weakness in the hips and surrounding muscles. Athletes can have a good squat or deadlift and still be weak in the hips and the adjacent areas. Weakness in the glutes (maximus, medius, and minimus), hamstrings, trunk musculature, hip external rotators, adductors, and flexors can lead to muscular imbalances, creating feelings of tightness in the hips and pelvis.
An easy way to think about this is to consider someone at the gym who always works on his bench and overhead press but neglects his scapular musculature and rotator cuff. In all likelihood, this guy will have very poor shoulder mobility.
Conversely, but still applicable, this can often be the case for those who feel like their hips are tight, but when they get assessed, they actually have a high range of motion—not just in the hips but also in the majority of joints in their bodies. These athletes can demonstrate poor strength and stability in their hip joints. Without good control of a joint, the musculature around the area may start tightening as a protective means to reduce the amount of stress placed on that body part. The more range one actually has, the more strength he may actually need to maintain control and stability of his hips.
Another reason the hips can have reduced mobility is decreased stability of the lumbar spine. I’ve discussed in a previous blog post how it is not uncommon for baseball players (and other young athletes) to develop a spondylolysis (a stress fracture, or reaction) at some point in their careers. One of the signs of this, and something that can remain lingering after other signs and symptoms clear up, is hip tightness (2).
Specifically, this can happen in the psoas major, a main hip flexor, which is also part of the core musculature that helps stabilize the spine (3). When the spine is injured, the deep layers of the psoas, which attach directly to the spine, become weak and atrophied. As a result, the superficial layers can take over and become very tight (2). This can happen on one or both sides of the spine. This tightness, if pronounced enough, can affect motion in all directions of the hip. Importantly, this tightness, along with other signs and symptoms of a spondylolysis, can be present in the absence of pain. If an athlete has any worries that he may fall into this category, he should seek the opinion of a healthcare professional.
The third possible factor that can contribute to decreased hip mobility is inefficient positioning of the pelvis. Excessive pelvic tilt is a commonly discussed trait found in many athletes, as well as the general population. There are many thought processes—the Janda Lower Crossed Syndrome, and the Postural Restoration Institute Posterior Exterior Chain (PEC)—that state that tightness in the lumbar extensor muscles and hip flexors essentially outweigh the weakness of the hamstrings, obliques, glutes, diaphragm and lower abdominals and as a result, the pelvis tilts forward anteriorly (1).
Over time this can become the body’s default position. When the pelvis is rotated forward, a couple things can happen. First, the muscles that attach to the pelvis, femur, and spine can be placed into either a more lengthened or more shortened position. This can lead to those muscles not being able to stretch to their full capabilities. In addition, these muscles can also be put at a mechanical disadvantage where they are not able to contract optimally (1).
Second, the acetabulum (the “socket” of the “ball and socket” joint) can shift forward. As a result, the head of the femur (the “ball” part of the joint) will not be centered into the socket. This will lead to the neck of the femur prematurely running into the rim of the socket when the hip is moving through certain ranges (1). This can be accompanied by a feeling of a bony restriction.
As you can see, hip restrictions represent a very complex challenge that often can’t be fully addressed with standard stretching and mobility exercises. Athletes who have been dealing with this issue for a long period of time should consider working with a health or fitness professional to get a good, proper assessment to help them find the underlying causes of their plateaued progress. For many athletes, this could be an important piece for their future health and performance.

Velocity-Based Training: Device Testing and Review - Driveline Baseball,2017-10-10T03:48:24+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/10/vbt-device-review/,"Velocity Based Training – or VBT – has slowly been gaining popularity as athletes and coaches look for the most cutting edge methods to train their athletes. With VBT, instead of training for maximal strength, athletes train for maximal speed. In theory, this trains more fast-twitch muscle fibers which translates more directly to the athlete’s sport. We have begun implementing VBT with some of our more advanced athletes, and you can read more about it in our VBT articles: Part 1 and Part 2.
But how do we measure velocity? Sure it’s easy enough to just “feel it out” and do some lighter weights as fast as you can, but how do you know how fast you’re actually moving the bar? Well, there’s the Tendo Unit, which is the gold-standard, but retails for $1600. VBT guru Bryan Mann swears by the GymAware, but that costs $2200.
Fortunately, a wave of much cheaper IMU based sensors are being released, namely the PUSH Band, the Beast Sensor, and the FORM Lifting Collar. Instead of using a cable to measure velocity, these sensors use a series of gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine barspeed, rather than a string attached to the barbell like the Tendo and GymAware. Most importantly, they’re all priced in the $249-$289 range, which offers a much cheaper alternative to the wired units.
But do they work?
We took it upon ourselves to carry out a small in-house study comparing these 3 sensors to the gold-standard of VBT, the Tendo. Our primary measurement was average velocity, which is the primary measurement used in VBT. Each sensor was compared individually to the Tendo, and 20 athletes performed 10 reps of bench press each. We looked at the average absolute difference between the Tendo and the sensor for all the reps, as well as the mean absolute percent error, or MAPE (MAPE is a measure of accuracy, lower percentage is better), in order to compare the sensors.
Let’s not waste any time, here’s the results:
Just by looking at the table, the obvious winner is the PUSH Band. It had the lowest average difference, and the lowest MAPE. Purely based on accuracy, it’s the obvious choice.
It is worth noting that although the overall difference of the sensors is pretty good, there are some trends to point out. The PUSH Band consistently read both negative and positive results, so you wouldn’t necessarily know if any particular rep was slower or faster, but the overall average for the workout was pretty accurate. The Beast Sensor, on the other hand, read almost always slower than the Tendo. Your actual speed would more often than not be 0.2 m/s faster than what the sensor recorded. FORM was similar to the PUSH in that it read both negative and positive results.
But there are a few caveats that I’d like to address.
First of all, yes, the FORM Collar looks pretty bad. There were, however, multiple misreads. For example, I doubt that one of our athletes did a rep at -3.86 m/s. When we eliminate all of these outliers, we wind up with a much more reasonable result.
They still lag a bit behind the PUSH and Beast, but the results are much more competitive. Standard outlier calculations were performed to create this table.
I’d also like to briefly talk about peak velocity, as some methods of training use it as the recorded metric. FORM does not measure peak velocity, so only Beast and PUSH were compared. Here are the results:
Both the average differences and the MAPE were identical to those for average velocity, with the PUSH slightly edging out the Beast Sensor. Beyond peak velocity, power calculations were rather inconsistent in all 3 sensors, and due to its limited use in the VBT training world, I have omitted it.
The final thing I want to discuss is the usability of the different sensors. All three of them are Bluetooth enabled, use a phone app, and were pretty easy to set up and use. PUSH and Beast both have a web portal in addition to the app, while FORM only exists in the app. All 3 apps are pretty easy and intuitive to use, although going back and looking at past sessions was a bit confusing in all of the apps. The portals for PUSH and Beast were much better for looking at past training sessions, offering rep-by-rep tables and all the data you could possibly want. The PUSH Band in particular had a very nice and user-friendly portal (although it costs a small monthly service charge to access it).
The disparity between the Tendo and the IMU-based sensors seems to come from their method of measurement. Maybe the discrepancies are due to the fact that PUSH and Beast are placed on the users forearm/ wrist, and not the bar. Maybe the athlete bounced the bar off their chest and the sensors were prone to jostled. My guess, however, is that the IMU technology is just not yet accurate enough to compete 1-on-1 with the Tendo or other similar VBT devices. That’s not to say these devices will never compete, and I’m sure technology will continue to advance and these types of sensors will get more accurate.
So if I had to pick one, I’d pick either the Tendo or the GymAware. Ok, if I didn’t have $2000 I’d probably pick the PUSH Band. It’s not 100% accurate, but it’s pretty close, and definitely gives you a good idea of how fast the bar is moving. It’s easy to use, and the app and the portal were probably the best out of the bunch. Just make sure to account for the fact that velocity readings may not be 100% accurate.
This article was written by Joseph Marsh, Lead Product Engineer at Driveline Baseball.
How about Bar Sensai? Should add that one to the list also.
I would also add OpenBarbell to the mix although they are hard to get a hold of… Their price is $250 which comparable to Push and Beast. But OpenBarbell is a drawstring based unit similar to a Tendo with Bluetooth app capabilities.

Stability & Pitching Mechanics - Driveline Baseball,2017-05-19T04:39:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/05/stability-pitching-mechanics/,"In Part 1 of this series, we talked about the importance of mobility in the pitching delivery. While mobility is crucial, stability is equally as important since it plays a critical role in injury prevention.
Mobility is defined as the ability to perform a desired movement; stability is defined as the ability to resist an undesired movement. Mobility relates to the actual movement while stability relates to the ability to control the joint through movement. Though by definition the two are opposite, they are complementary in performance.
In Part 1 we talked about mobility in the scapula, thoracic spine, and hips. In Part 2, we’re going to dive into stability in the trunk, specifically the lumbar spine and the rotator cuff.
Why is a strong core essential for athletics? All athletic movements originate from the core. The muscles in the core consist of the pectoralis major, external oblique, internal oblique, rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, and hip adductors.
These muscles are meant to stabilize the lumbar spine for rotation, extension, and flexion. Having a stable core allows for acceleration and deceleration during movement.
Anti-extension exercises are any exercises in which you are trying to resist extension of the spine. Baseball players spend a large amount of their time standing in extension or excessive anterior tilt of the hips. Anterior tilt of the hips means that your hips are tilted downward, or toward the front of your body, creating a lengthened posterior chain. Anterior tilt of the hips can lead to pulled hamstrings, anterior knee pain, and hip pain.
The purpose of anti-extension exercises is to encourage posterior tilt as well as engage anterior core and lumbo-pelvic hip stabilizers.
Dead Bug – Take a big inhale promoting 360-degree expansion into torso and lower contralateral limbs in an effort to resist extension, full exhale at the bottom of each rep.
Hard Style Plank – Pull elbows and feet towards each other while squeezing glutes as tightly as possible.
Anti-rotation is right up there with scapular movement in degree of importance for baseball athletes. While it is essential for baseball players to be strong and rotationally explosive to throw with velocity or hit for power, it is equally important to be strong and stable to resist rotation. Any exercise in which you are trying to resist rotation through the spine is an anti-rotation exercise.
Hip-shoulder separation is a key factor in pitching development. It is difficult for athletes to dissociate the rotation between the hips and shoulders. Having anti-rotation core stability allows athletes to keep their trunks closed while their lower halves and hips rotate open. Being stable through rotation allows rotation to occur through the thoracic spine rather than the lumbar spine after getting to foot strike.
A great example of how mobility and stability compliment each other is the relationship between the thoracic and lumbar spine. Similar to what we talked about in part one, if athletes lack thoracic mobility, they will sacrifice stability for mobility in the lumbar spine to create “fake separation.”
Because of all of the rotation that occurs in baseball, such as swinging and throwing, baseball players must be able to decelerate rotation. This is why there is an abundance of oblique strains in Major League Baseball.
The goal for anti-rotation exercises is to keep the rib cage locked into the pelvis, rotate the hips, and remove pressure from the spine into the working muscles.
Standing Anti-Rotation Cable Iso-Hold – Hold the external load straight out from your chest without allowing the load to pull you.
Pallof Press – Press straight out with the external load not allowing the weight to pull you.
Anti-Rotation Cable Chop – Rotate the external load using only your arms without letting the torso rotate at all.
The muscles that make up the rotator cuff are the teres minor, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and subscapularis. Since repetitive throwing leads to anterior shoulder laxity, rotator-cuff strength provides stability in the glenohumeral joint for injury prevention.
In Part 1 of this series, we talked about the importance of scapular movement. According to the joint-by-joint approach, the glenohumeral joint should be mobile while the scapula should be stable. However, if athletes don’t have sufficient stability in their glenohumeral joint, it’s likely that they also don’t have stability in their scapulas; another great example of how mobility and stability work together.
While it’s important to have stability in the scapula regarding protraction and retraction, mobility is necessary for upward rotation. Similarly, while mobility in the glenohumeral joint plays a role in elevating the arm into scapular plane and internal and external rotation, the rotator cuff’s main function is to provide stability to center the humeral head in the glenoid fossa. In addition to assisting in glenohumeral range of motion, the rotator cuff assists in internal and external force production, which is essential for throwing a baseball.
As far as training the rotator cuff goes, the idea is to perform exercises that force the rotator cuff to “grab onto” the ball in socket—pretty much any exercise while holding a dumbbell or barbell causes the rotator cuff to fire.
When training the rotator cuff, it is important to understand that because of the small size of the muscles, we do not want to train them to fatigue. When the rotator cuff is fatigued, the humeral head will shift towards the acromion process, increasing the likelihood of shoulder impingement. Therefore, while band work is great for activating muscles pre-throwing and recovery post-throwing, excessive band work is unnecessary and can potentially be more harmful.
Half-Kneeling External Rotation Rhythmic Stabilizations – In scapular plane, gently tap the elbow and upper arm for 10 seconds, forcing rotator cuff to “grab on.”
Upward Throws – A great post-throwing recovery exercise we use in gym. Start in internal rotation and externally rotate up, tossing the ball. Catch on the way back down and control the internal deceleration.
90/90 External Rotation Iso-Holds – With back up against the wall in scapular plane, have your shoulder, elbow, and hand all against the wall, press back of hand into wall and hold for 1-2 seconds.
Bottoms Up KB Carry – Another great post-throwing recovery exercise in gym to stabilize the rotator cuff after throwing. Elbow slightly below shoulder, keep biceps relaxed and core engaged.
Mobility and stability needs are not always black and white. It’s important to assess athletes for movement and strength to determine what their individual needs are before programming. Regarding mobility and stability needs, understand the joint-by-joint approach, determine the soft-tissues surrounding each joint, and have an understanding of the needs of the surrounding joints and how they affect movement.
Most importantly, understand that mobility and stability, while their definitions are opposites, work together in unison to help the body move as efficiently as possible.

Return to Throwing Program,2015-09-30T14:05:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/05/data-driven-rehabilitation-tommy-john-surgery-troy-rallings-case-study/,"The traditional model for phases of rehab that occur after Tommy John surgery look something like this:
This blog will focus on improvements that can be made in a return to throwing program.
ThiThis blog was updated on 6/3/2022 and was written by Dean Jackson and Kyle Lindley, edited by Michael O’Connell
Below is an example of what an Interval Throwing Program may look like.
It’s our opinion at Driveline Baseball that this type of program has three major flaws:
Let’s break them down:
Your first day throwing on this program involves two sets of “warm-up throws” and 50 total throws from 45 feet. If you split the difference on the warm-up throws and call it 15 throws each (10-20 per the document), then you are making 80 total throws on your first post-surgery throwing day!
The most common side effect of these types of programs involves soreness and setbacks due to the inability to overcome the volume of the program. This can create a vicious cycle of starting, stopping, and restarting a throwing program.
Our article detailing “pulldown” throws goes into a bit of detail, but players need to be tested at game-like intensities before they return to competition. We need to make sure that they are occurring at the appropriate time
Secondly, there is no monitoring outside of distance. Pitchers going out to 180 feet on this program do so at varying angles, velocities, and intent. Throwing at 40 mph or 60 mph at 60 feet should not be equal.
This program cannot be equally effective for the MLB pitcher who sits 95 MPH and the 17-year-old who sits 83 MPH. Other than different starting points, there are drastically different resources available to one over another.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also has its flaws as a measure of intensity.
Previous research has shown that the percentage of effort that a pitcher is trying to throw at does not correlate strongly with how hard the pitcher is throwing compared to their velocity peak (Slenker, Limpisvasti, et al. – Biomechanical comparison of the interval throwing program and baseball pitching: upper extremity loads in training and rehabilitation AJSM May 2014).
At 60% of perceived effort, pitchers were generating forces of 76% and ball speeds approaching 84% of maximum intensity.
Pitchers are really bad at estimating how much effort they are expending and consistently underestimate it. This should have profound implications for rehabilitation programs.
Programs are often written in a way that doesn’t account for the rest of a player’s life.
Some baseball players returning from surgery have a nice, smooth recovery process. Others do not. Some players’ bodies won’t let them progress for a few weeks. Other athletes feel incredible, and they feel ahead of schedule. It’s a rollercoaster to try and help a player along with  Physical Therapists and surgeons.
They are difficult to adjust in all areas because everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Because of this, there will often be some sort of setback due to throwing volume and intensity. After all, everyone will respond differently to a program. But we need to remember that other factors outside of the throwing program can also cause setbacks. Lack of sleep, varying nutrition, school load, or travel are a few reasons that can also cause setbacks.
The fact of the matter is tools exist today that can raise the standards of Tommy John rehab. We want a standardized approach but an individualized method.
The solution is to use technology to better track progress and make programs individualized. This means utilizing
Combined with subjective measures, these objective measures give us the best chance for the next revolution of rehab programs.
Using Pulse and a radar gun, we can monitor the following variables:
You can read more about the metrics on Pulse here.
We can use those to better supplement subjective measures by asking the athlete questions such as:
We can combine these to create the four main phases of our return to throwing program:
We can layer on more extensive monitoring with Pulse and Radar Gun inside these phases.
Arm Speed will be used as our primary monitoring tool until ~700 RPM Arm Speed. Reaching ~700 Arm Speed typically occurs after several weeks of throwing.
Once ~700 RPM arm speed is reached, we would switch to a combination of arm speed and throwing velocity. Arm speed and velocity would be used to continue progressing intensity through the remainder of the rehab. We choose ~700 RPM Arm Speed because that is approximately where Pulse Arm Speed starts to deviate from throwing velocity.
We would progress intensity using object data (arm speed and throwing velocity) and subjective data from that point on. Focusing on how he felt he was recovering, how his mechanics looked like his, and how his body responded well to the increased intensity.
The example below is from a return to throwing program with athlete Ryan Cloude. This example represents a sample of what can be done with a data-driven return to throwing program. The advice dispensed in this article would certainly not work for everyone for the reasons stated above. We know how weighted balls affect the torque on the arm and workload, the example program below only used baseballs.
Ryan Cloude is a 21-year-old collegiate pitcher. He has an interesting training history, having increased his pitching velocity from 83mph as a college freshman to topping at 95mph as a junior. In the middle of his junior season, he tore his UCL and required UCL reconstruction.
The goal of this phase was to build a throwing volume base at a low intensity. We start all our athletes off with a low threshold to set them up for increased intensity later.
Ryan threw 3x per week during this 4-week phase. We monitored Arm Speed with Pulse, gradually increasing from a one-session average of ~200 RPM and top 1/8th ~250 RPM to a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM.
Total throws per session increased from 25 to 90 from the beginning to the last day of the phase.
We built this phase of the throwing volume base established in Phase 1 by increasing the throwing intensity on Monday and Friday each week.
Once Ryan hit the ~700 RPM arm speed mark, we switched measuring intensity from Arm Speed to throwing velocity.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM to a one-session average of ~600 RPM and top 1/8th ~850 RPM. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 49.9 mph and top 1/8th 57.6 mph to a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th 76.0 mph.
Instead of throw counts, Ryan was given options between 60-90 throws on the higher intensity days. At the same time, lower intensity days progressed gradually from 90 to 120 throws. He did the max number of throws most days, except for three days where the daily notes had some variation of “another crazy conditioning at 6 am this morning, body felt dead. Stopped at 60 throws”—no arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
One week, the same intensity was repeated (instead of progressing it) because Ryan was exhausted from team conditioning and didn’t want to push it.
Return to throwing templates lack guidelines on how to make adjustments to the program. At times the adjustment doesn’t need to be because something went wrong with the throwing program. But other parts of a player’s life are still ongoing when rehabbing a throwing injury. Tracking these programs leaves a player and a coach in a much better place to make an appropriate adjustment.
The only difference between the schedule of this phase and the last is that instead of the weeks going HLH, HLH (higher intensity, low, higher, and repeat), they went HLH, LHL (higher intensity, low, repeat). This shifted Ryan from 4 higher intensity throwing days every two weeks to 3 high-intensity throwing days every two weeks.
There were two new additions in phase three. First, bullpens at lower intensity began in this phase. Second, we started to focus more on moving efficiently. We measure movement efficiency by throwing the prescribed velocity with the lowest possible arm speed.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~600 and top 1/8th of ~850 to a one-session average of ~700 and top 1/8th of ~ 925. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th of 76.0 mph to a one-session average of 69.6 mph and top 1/8th of 89.4 mph.
His volume options remained 60-90 on higher intensity days and 90-120 on lower intensity days. Ryan decided not to throw the max amount of throws on a given day: total body soreness from training with his team and getting kicked out of the gym as it was closing. No arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
Bullpen throwing velocity was dropped back to the high 70s, with two pens being thrown each week, and lower intensity days were added over a couple of weeks until Ryan was throwing five days a week.
Throwing velocity on main bullpen days gradually increased from a one-session average of 64.5 mph and top 1/8th of 77.4 mph to a one-session average of 74.2 and top 1/8th 90.9 mph.
We had phases that we wanted to progress through and a good idea how roughly how much we should progress over a certain period, but ultimately we let Ryan’s body decide if it was ready to progress or not.
If the prescribed intensity for a session wasn’t comfortable, we would not progress intensity in the next session (regardless of what the program template said). We would repeat the intensity (or reduce it) until it was comfortable. The main idea in the intensity prescribing process was “letting the door be opened” when Ryan’s body was ready and not trying to “kick the door down” and force a more intense stimulus on his arm before it was ready.
Other pitch types were added first to recovery days during this phase. Simply by throwing offspeed in flat ground or catch play/long toss work. Intensity and volume were gradually increased until Ryan was throwing at maximum intensity on the mound.
Volume options for total throws on each bullpen day gradually increased from 60-90 to 90-110, while volume options for lower intensity days stayed 90-120. Once Ryan’s velocity got back into the high 80’s a few bullpens turned into recovery days because he didn’t feel fully recovered.
The first live session versus hitters happened roughly 10.5 months post-op and went well enough that Ryan decided he was ready to face hitters in a game that counted for his team. The first outing versus hitters in a real game happened just before the 11-month post-op mark and resulted in 1IP 0H 0BB 3K.
After completing his return to play, Ryan reflected on the process as a whole:
“Having objective data to show my progress was massive for my mental state. On days where I wasn’t able to hit my goal or days where I felt I was so far away from being healthy, I’d be able to look back and see how much harder I was throwing and how much more arm speed I was able to handle.”
It’s widespread to hear athletes talk about the mental toll injuries took on them and how grueling the whole experience is. I believe collecting data to give athletes a good idea of where they are now, where they have been, and where they need to go can significantly improve how comfortable their experience with rehab ends up being.
Ryan also said:
“(I) loved having a progression based on how I was recovering and not a cookie-cutter program that’s the same for everyone.”
We’re attacking it via our integrated staff training methods, technology, and Driveline TRAQ – and results have never been better, both on the performance AND rehab sides.

Athlete Screening Part 2: Performance Screens - Driveline Baseball,2017-05-15T23:56:05+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/05/athlete-screening-part-2-performance-screens/,"Last time, we discussed the importance of having a movement screen and a few of the options that are available to coaches. If you missed that article, check it out here, as a few of the concepts we touched on will come into play throughout this article as well.
For starters, let’s define what strength and power are: Power is the ability to generate force as fast as possible while strength is the ability to exert maximal force against an external load. In facility, we use very few true strength tests during our screening process: the dynamometer for external and internal shoulder rotation strength, and grip strength (both discussed in the previous article) are about the only true strength tests we do. Most lean towards the power end of the spectrum.
The main reason for this is safety. Most athletes are ill prepared to perform a five rep max back squat or deadlift their first day in facility, or they simply can’t perform these exercises with good technique. It would be irresponsible to force them to do so. By using other power metrics, we have a more consistent baseline test across all athletes from which we can better measure and track their improvement.
When structuring our screening process, we start with power exercises first and then move towards strength exercises. The reason for this is that the energy systems responsible for power exercises are depleted quicker than those that provide energy for strength exercises. In order to prevent fatigue during power exercises and establish as accurate of a baseline as possible, we transition from power- to strength-based exercises.
The first assessment we perform are jumps. We progress through a sequence of broad jumps, single-leg broad jumps, lateral jumps, and vertical jumps with the tendo unit. Jumps are not only an easy way to test overall athleticism and get an idea of how much force an athlete can put into the floor, but they’re also another way to screen how well athletes move.
In the last article, we talked about dynamic-movement screens. Jumps are a great form of this. Watch how an athlete moves: do the knees dive in, does the trunk collapse, does he go slip into lumbar extension? What do the knees do when he lands?
We can learn a lot about movement by looking at it dynamically on top of doing a typical range of motion (ROM) screen. This is where it’s also important to note tha an athlete is only competent in a movement if they can perform it with speed! Just because athletes get into the positions doesn’t mean they have stability through that ROM, so we take notes on how they move when moving fast.
The next assessment we perform is rotational power with the aid of a Keiser machine. A chop is primarily used for assessing pitcher’s rotational power due to its similarities to the rotational component of pitching. The Keiser is also ideal because it’s easy to use, provides instant feedback, and the weight can be adjusted easily for different level athletes.
Another option, though more difficult, is to use med balls and a radar gun. Changing the settings on the radar gun allows for lower velocities and performing med ball shot-puts gives an idea of how well your athletes can rotate.
Our lifting assessment, again, leans slightly towards power, with our athletes performing back squat, deadlift, and bench press at submaximal weights on the tendo unit. We use the tendo unit during this part of our assessment because it allows us to have measureable data on an athlete’s improvement while providing some indication about what an athlete’s maximal strength capabilities are without having to perform a rep max test.
However, many coaches don’t have access to a tendo unit. In this case doing a rep-max test with athletes is the most viable option. Even with athletes you’ve trained and know will demonstrate good technique, it’s often not worth pushing them to a one-rep max test due to the accumulated fatigue of working to failure and the breakdown in technique that tends to occur. Instead, we recommend working in the three-to-five rep range.
In addition to assessing strength, this is another opportunity to check movement quality. Some of an athlete’s technique comes down to how he was coached, but some of it comes down to his ability to move. Is he missing ROM or does he have too much ROM? Does he have the ability to maintain a neutral spine? Do his knees dive in on a squat?
Use this as an opportunity to assess and gain knowledge for what your athletes need, not just how strong they are.
As we touched on at the end of the movement-screen article, it’s important to have some form of strength/power assessment to monitor your athletes and track performance. It’s even more important to have some form of both movement and strength assessment. Far too often coaches and trainers view these as separate needs when they are not. You don’t need an exaggerated, long screening process that checks for everything, but what you do need is something to assess your athletes and provide you with the information to make the right prescriptions for their training programs.

Athlete Screening Part 1: Movement Screens - Driveline Baseball,2017-05-10T01:15:29+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/05/athlete-screening-part-1-movement-screens/,"You can’t fix a problem if you don’t know it exists.
If you’ve played the game of baseball before, chances are someone has told you to fix your mechanics. Mechanics are an ingrained part of this game that players and coaches alike seek to consistently improve upon and refine. However, what is often neglected when striving for perceived mechanical perfection is how an athlete moves on a fundamental level.
Enter the movement screen: an integral piece of a successful training program, because, when it comes down to it, pitching is movement. If we are going to constantly assess, critique, and change our pitchers’ mechanics, then we also should understand the elements of their fundamental movements.
By gaining an understanding for what players do well and what they need to work on, from a base-movement standpoint, we can begin to positively change their programming in the weight room to improve weaknesses and possibly even solve some of those persistent mechanical faults!
First, let’s look at what we’re actually assessing in a movement screen. What we’re actually looking for is joint mobility and stability, and we do this in one of two ways.
The first is in a static position that requires the athlete or trainer to actively move the athlete’s body through a range of motion (ROM) in order to determine if a “normal” ROM is present about that joint. An example of this is having the athlete perform a straight-leg raise from a supine position.
Another way to assess movement is to have the athlete perform some sort of dynamic activity such as a squat, a lunge, or a push-up. These provide even more feedback, because if you understand mobility, you know it’s important to not just have full ROM but also to have strength through a ROM.
This is where you can really begin to see things that are potentially impacting your athletes’ performance.
One of the most popular movement screens is the Functional Movement Screen (FMS). The FMS is a good place to start for coaches looking to implement a simple baseline movement screen, because it assesses seven basic movement patterns and includes dynamic movement. It’s also fairly easy to screen and score, and it provides a measure for baseline performance of an athlete. This makes the coach’s job easier too, because it allows for a simple rescreening process with measurement of improved performance.
Another option, one a bit more applicable to baseball, is the Titleist Performance Institute (TPI) screen, which is intended for golfers. This screen has a more rotational focus than the FMS.
It’s important to note that regardless of what screen you decide to start with, one mentioned above or your own, re-testing is vitally important. You want to know if playing games or training has had a positive, negative, or no effect on a player’s movement.
Neither of the previous two screens are specific enough for baseball players, especially pitchers, and what’s more unfortunate is that there isn’t a quality baseball-specific screen available yet.
Although, what’s most important is starting somewhere. Once you start and rescreen, you can always continue to evolve and add or subtract things to your screening process.
That’s exactly how our screen at Driveline has come about. We initially started with the FMS, which we modified and changed. Even today we continue to evolve as we learn more and more about our athletes. With that said though, the best screens include a review of basic movement patterns and some sport specific screens.
Below are some more baseball-specific screens that we use in facility, which coaches and athletes can implement easily:
Internal / External Shoulder Strength: A table and a hand held dynamometer can be used to measure the force of both shoulders during the season. Be sure to measure both shoulders to compare a pitcher’s dominant to non-dominant arms. It is common for internal-rotation peak force to be higher than external-rotation peak force on the throwing side. This is not cause for concern unless the strength in the external rotators is below 60% of the internal-rotation strength.
Internal/External Range of Motion: A table and an extendable goniometer can be used to measure the range-of-motion of both shoulders during the season. Be sure to measure both shoulders to compare a pitcher’s dominant to non-dominant arms. It is common for pitchers to gain external ROM and lose internal ROM as the season goes on. You will want to retest ROM throughout the season to see if there are any changes to the total range of motion of an pitcher’s throwing arm.
Grip-strength: Grip strength is a simple assessment that can be completed with a grip dynamometer. It can serve the purpose of testing strength gains if used throughout the year. It can also be a helpful measure in-season. Periodic testing in-season can give a glimpse of an athlete’s central nervous system. A sharp decrease in grip strength from a baseline can suggest a fatigued athlete.
Hip Internal/External Rotation: With the athlete lying supine, flex the leg to 90 degrees, place a hand on the ankle, the other on the knee, and gently move the athlete into internal and external rotation while noting when you feel bind. Examine the other leg for inconsistencies in ROM between sides. This is a fairly simple test for internal-external rotation mobility which has importance for lower-half movement when throwing.
As I said, our movement screen at Driveline has continued to grow and shift as we’ve expanded our screening process to include more technology. One piece of technology is the Kinetisense.
Kinetisense is a markerless motion-capture system that allows us to quickly and efficiently determine degrees of ROM for certain joint movements. The benefit this provides is that it removes the inter-rater reliability. We now have data that reflects an athlete’s actual ROM for a movement, which will be consistent across all testers.
And as you know, here at Driveline, we love data! But in all seriousness, having this data helps us to refine our movement screen. Most movement screens only look for deficiencies compared to the right and left sides, but baseball is an asymmetric sport—we often only rotate one way. What makes an athlete’s right side different from their left side might be what makes them great; it might be what keeps them healthy. As we continue to assess and validate the kinetisense through our biomechanics lab, we hope to bridge the gap between base movement deficiencies and actual injury predictors.

Velocity Based Training Part 2: Programming - Driveline Baseball,2017-04-27T11:23:04+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/04/velocity-based-training-part-2-programming/,"In Part One, I explained velocity-based training (VBT) and why we’ve decided to implement it with our athletes.
Today, in Part 2 I will explore how to program VBT individual athletes to best improve their performance.
(This article was written by Jack Scheideman, High Performance Trainer at Driveline Baseball)
At Driveline, we are attempting to maximize strength, hypertrophy, and power production to create athletes that can throw gas and drop tanks.
We strive to provide individualized programs based on assessments (which deserves its own blog post) to maximize athletes’ results with the focus on power production. For a VBT program to be successful, individualization needs to occur to allow the athletes to work on their specific needs.
A young athlete needs to squat, deadlift, and bench press while the MLB All-Star needs to focus on more fine-tuning related to his sport-specific training.
Athletes need to be sufficiently strong before they start a VBT program. This, admittedly, will depend on each athlete and his playing level. But it should be pretty clear that any high school or college athlete that is struggling to squat 225 needs to lift more and focus on strength. To be able to maximize strength and hypertrophy, you need to use big exercises where you can move significant weight. This is why we choose to bench, squat, deadlift, and lift heavy rows. You need to pick big exercises, the big lifts, that stimulate the most muscle fibers possible in order to grow..
If you don’t think size matters in baseball that’s fine, but let’s take a look at the top six average exit velocities in baseball last year.
Aaron Judge is 6’7” and weighs 282 lbs, Nelson Cruz is listed at 6’2 and weighs 240 lbs. Wait—someone on this list has to be small, right? The answer is no, all of these guys are listed at at least 240 lbs.
If you’re trying to increase strength and your strength coach brings out a speed ladder, run away as fast as you can.
If you are a coach starting a VBT program, the trainee will either be an intermediate or elite athlete, based on Mark Rippetoe’s classification rubric. The rough rule of thumb is that a novice will be able to recover from “heavy loads” between 24 to 72 hours.
An intermediate athlete might take 72 or more hours to recover from a “heavy” load, while advanced/elite lifters can take weeks to recover from heavy loads.
It takes longer for elite athletes to recover because these athletes are much closer to their genetic max, which makes each session significantly more taxing on the Central Nervous system (CNS). This is why autoregulation, an objective measure of overtraining, is so important for intermediate/advanced/elite level athletes. (I went into depth on this in Part 1)
These classifications are important because it would be pointless to throw novice athletes on a VBT program. If you can’t squat 225, stop reading this article, and go hire a coach to learn how to squat and deadlift!
There is no magic program that will help you at this point; you just need to spend hours with a barbell in your hand and progressively add weight to the bar. There are two main reasons for this;
A good rule of thumb is to start an athlete on a VBT program when his deadlift is 2x BW, back squat 1.5x BW, and their bench press is 1x BW. If an athlete reaches this point and is still progressing using a “linear periodization model”, don’t stop. Gains do not come easily.
If you have ever worked with or been an intermediate or above lifter, you know how frustrating stalled progress can be. If athletes haven’t reached these goals by the end of their novice cycle, which is highly likely, then another absolute strength module should be started. Pick a programming-format model where exercise variation is occurring, coupled with either a percentage-based system or a linear periodization in which the athlete progresses from week to week. When the athlete does not add weight to the bar every workout, this is because he can no longer recover from the stimulus.
As you can see with this template, as the athlete leaves the novice phase, more complexity needs to be programmed in to provide a new stimulus. Complexity refers to new exercises being introduced to the athlete. Without this new stimulus, an athlete will reach a plateau much faster if there is not an introduction of new exercises or velocity range.
This is the stage where we choose to add in a VBT program to give the athlete a new stimulus, with the hope of adding significantly more power production by training the CNS through a VBT protocol. By this point, an athlete would qualify as an intermediate athlete; this is a result of his recovery ability decreasing. He is at a higher level of his genetic max and because of that, the work he does is significantly more taxing. It is not an indication of how strong the athlete is, as we know everyone has different genetic ceilings.
Once we learn where the athlete’s absolute strength levels are, we can now program VBT based on his needs. Remember, I’m going to say this again: don’t be the guy that starts a VBT program squatting 185 and deadlifting 225.
Every new athlete that comes to Driveline goes through the same assessment so that we can give him a lifting program that works on his specific needs. Novice athletes don’t need to prance on a bosu ball, do endless core work, or go through every corrective exercise under the sun. Squats, deadlifts, presses, and rows are going to provide stability and core training.
Yeah I’m sure Marius built this core doing side planks and reverse crunches. Or maybe it was because he picked up heavy objects all day, for decades.
Our assessment includes a mobility portion (a topic worth another blog post), rotational power using the Keiser, and a test of power production where we use the tendo unit. We use the tendo for two main testing protocols:
Based on the weight used on the three compound lifts, we are now ready to write a program that caters to each athlete’s unique needs.
Once we have established that the athlete is strong enough to start a VBT program, the first quality we start training is strength-speed. This is the first progression from the quality of absolute strength, and the athlete also produces the most power in this velocity range. We use the main three lifts: back squat, bench press, and deadlift, as they allow the athlete to move the most weight, which produces the highest power production. We do not use accessory lifts for VBT, such as a certain type of row. Accessory lifts are programed to work on weaknesses and help the athlete progress on the main movements. There are a few rules to follow when starting the first phase of a VBT program:
I will have the athletes do doubles for 8-12 sets until they drop below 90% on two consecutive lifts of their best rep that day. In order to calculate this, for example, I’ll look at if the athlete’s best rep that day was at 0.88 m/sec and on set 7 they have two consecutive reps below 0.79 m/sec, then I’ll know the athlete’s workout is done for that day. This ensures that they are not overtraining and will be able to recover before the next workout.
We use a “linear progression” model from workout to workout so that progression is continuously occurring for the athlete. If you keep the weight the same every week and the velocity is not improving, that athlete will not be giving his body a new stimulus to adapt to. He’ll be spinning his wheels and not improving at all.
This might sound like a lot of technology in the weight room, but it allows us to better track progress. The athletes will have to quickly learn how to train with intensity and what it means to put force into the barbell. If they don’t, the tendo will tell us. This isn’t most gym cultures.
Mediocre intensity is frowned upon; yelling and loud music is celebrated. If you learn to truly train with intensity, you will be rewarded; if you don’t know what that means, go watch Westside Barbell lifters lift on YouTube, or better yet, come to Driveline. It is imperative that weight is added from workout to workout to allow athletes to continue to progress their rate of force development. In a month, if your are doing the same amount of sets and the velocity has stayed the same but you have added 30 pounds to the bar, your power production has gone up significantly.
Rest periods for your dynamic effort days are imperative and one of the most undervalued variability in training. It is imperative that the rest periods are kept under 60 seconds, which is different than on a max-effort day, when rest periods should last 5 minutes. Why such a short rest period?
If you don’t agree with these reasons, that’s fine, continue to text and look at Facebook on your iPhone while trying every program under the sun, blaming your college coach every day, and not understanding why you throw 75 mph and haven’t improved in two years. There is a reason so many guys make it to elite levels of athletics using so many different program besides genetics.
At some point, each athlete will plateau when using a linear progression on dynamic effort days.
Once an athlete has plateaued, the key is to create variability in the training. A plateau occurs when the athlete is either not adding weight to the bar and keeping the same velocity or not improving velocity with the same weight. Don’t overreact to not improving for a few weeks; a true plateau is months of stalled progress. If this happens, a change in some aspect of training needs to occur to allow for the athlete to adapt to a new stimulus. If the athlete has truly understood what training with intensity means, then it is time to progress. There are many different options that you can pick from:
This is where training becomes much more complicated, and analysis of an athlete’s strength and weaknesses needs to be conducted. By this point, the athlete is sufficiently strong and should be producing sufficient power. The goal now is to be able to be more precise in what we are doing on the training side to be able to produce the best results on the field. The first step is to identify where the athlete would have the most carry-over in training by identifying the weakness of the athlete. This could be that starting strength-speed needs work. This is where a speed-strength program could be utilized, by using accommodating resistance, plyometrics, and different throwing exercises to improve performance. An injury or overtraining could be the root of the issue, and then programming and lifestyle need to be addressed.
One of the most common issues is that the work being done in the weight room will have very little transfer once the athlete becomes elite. A young athlete has a huge pool of exercises that transfer to performance, but the opposite is true for the elite thrower (a later blog post will go into this programming). This makes assessing the elite athlete’s strengths and weaknesses hugely important to optimize training to transfer into sport-specific performance.
One of the hardest parts about being an older athlete (30+ years) is maintaining the same power production that made one good in the first place. Many older athletes will see their pitching velocities drop and bat speed start to diminish. This can be from a multitude of reasons, such as a large workload of innings pitched or injuries accumulated over time. One way you can change this is to continue training for power production in order to maintain and continue to build type-2 muscle fibers. This can be accomplished by training maximal strength, plyometrics, and VBT as these training methods stimulate high-threshold motor units. As the athlete gets older, type-2 muscle fibers atrophy, and it is imperative that the athlete continues to stimulate these muscle fibers to ensure that type-2 muscle fibers do not fade away over time. If these muscle atrophy, then performance will decline.
A few examples of older athletes who are throwing just as hard or harder than ever as they push into their 30s are Joe Beimel and Casey Weathers. If you go to Beimel’s Instagram @joebeimel97, you will see videos of him throwing 95 mph on a flat ground or Casey pulling down 107 and sitting mid-90s with a 5 oz baseball from an indoor mound. Both of these athletes have continued to progress with regards to velocity as they age and both have a few things in common.
Talking with both of them, it is clear they have each taken recovery and weight-room activities seriously throughout their careers. This is definitely a huge reason for their continued performance, but there could be another reason for their success as they have gotten older: both have started a VBT program this offseason, instead of the all-too-common, misunderstood, and misused corrective-based programs for older athletes.
This offseason, they both implemented a VBT-style program, with great results. If you look at Beimel’s posts, you will see him smashing 400-pound squats, a 500-pound deadlifts, and benching 300 pounds all through full ranges of motion. Casey has thrown harder off the indoor mound this winter then he has at any point in his career. This could definitely be a result of older athletes lifting heavy and using a VBT program to stimulate type-2 muscle fibers. Both of these are crucial as athletes age and move into the latter part of their career. Older athletes need to continue to train for power or their performance will suffer.
This phenomenon is best shown through Olympic-level shot-putter Werner Gunthor, who had biopsies taken of his muscles late into his career. This is a test in which part of the muscle is taken out of the body and analyzed. Werner had a low number of fast-twitch muscle fibers for an elite-level shot-putter: the area of muscle fibers was much larger than any athlete tested. This meant that through training, he was able to hypertrophy his fast-twitch, or type-2 muscle fibers. He lifted heavy, used eccentrics, plyometrics, and speed-based lifts to hypertrophy these areas, and because of this, he became an elite-level shot-putter.
Here you can see Gunthor’s biopsy results and above is a link to his training style—look familiar?
As you can see, he continued to progress until 1988, which is near a world-record mark. After that, however, he continued to perform at a high level: his last year of competing, he was 34 years old. Consider that a 22-meter throw wins almost any Olympics and a 21.50 gets you a medal. For almost a decade, he was able compete at a world-class level, which is considered very rare in track and field, or any sport.
VBT allows athletes to produce significantly more power by using a data-driven approach to the weight room. The objective feedback of the number on the screen does not lie; you can’t cheat it. Athletes will have to learn what it means to train with intensity, and at some point, they will just have to grip it and rip it.
Get strong, get fast, and see what it can do for your performance.

Integration of Throwing and Strength - Driveline Baseball,2017-04-24T13:32:25+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/04/integration-throwing-strength/,"In recent years, baseball has undergone a pendulum shift. Big leaguers are posting offseason-workout videos of 500 lbs deadlifts or 400 lbs squats. Colleges all around the country are throwing their athletes into the weight room and telling them to get bigger, faster, stronger, and all of this is a good thing for the game of baseball, as evidenced by the increase in fastball velocity and 400+ foot dingers.
However, like anything being introduced for the first time, there comes with it a deluge of misunderstanding and misguidance on how best to incorporate it. The most common problem being that all too often the strength and throwing side of things are pigeonholed into their own silos.
Honestly, it’s not good enough to just have a strength program. If it’s a part of your training, then it needs to be fully integrated with your throwing program. That means we have to have strength coaches and pitching coaches sit down together and plan out programming as one.
So, before we delve into how to do this, let’s look at why we need this. Honestly, the why is pretty simple. It all boils down to the fact that training economy matters and that each athlete’s training economy is limited.
Imagine an athlete’s training economy in the form of a dollar.
He goes through a moderately intense practice; practice costs him 50 cents. He runs sprints after practice for conditioning; sprints cost him 15 cents. He gets his moderate-intensity lift in post practice; that costs him 35 cents. That’s his whole dollar right there, but that’s fine because he had a dollar to spend.
Now imagine you have him throw five innings, eighty pitches, in an intrasquad game. That’s going to burn through a lot more than 50 cents of his dollar. Let’s say that costs him 75 cents, and then if you compound conditioning and lifting on top of it, your pitcher is pretty quickly in debt from a training-economy standpoint.
The most important part here to also consider is that it takes your athlete time to earn, or “recover,” the money to pay off his debt, as well as earn enough to pay for his next bout of training. Stack up enough debt, and both an athlete’s recovery and performance will tank.
Training economy is a pretty simple concept, but it’s the first thing we need to understand when we start building out the strength and throwing programming. After that, we focus on what goals we have for each athlete and what time of the year it is. To simplify this, you can break the goal setting down into two categories: the first being physically oriented; the second being skill oriented.
These goals will likely create the greatest initial performance improvements as well as lay the foundation for improvements years later in development. These can be broken down into three subcategories of goals: Hypertrophy, strength, or power.
For example, if we have a 6’3” freshman pitcher weighing a buck sixty who can’t deadlift twice his bodyweight, we need to increase body mass (hypertrophy), and then in later phases, develop strength and power. He is an example of having physically oriented goals and the majority of his training economy will be spent in the weight room.
These goals are more specific to pitching and include mechanical efficiency, command work, pitch development, velocity development, etc.
In contrast to the college freshman who struggles to pick a weight up off the ground, if we have a junior pitcher who is 6’2”, 215 lbs, and is strong as an ox, he’s going to have different developmental goals. For him, the physical weight-room work isn’t as important. Instead, he needs skill-oriented goals. He needs to spend less of his training economy in the weight room and more on performing tasks that are either throwing related or very close to the movements.
Now that we know what goals we have for our athlete, we need to look at the limiting factor: the time of the year. This matters because you’re not going to have an athlete crushing physical work with little skill work right before the start of your season, or tons of skill work with no physical work four months from opening day.
One thing to point out here is that regardless of an athlete’s goals and needs, he will spend time performing both physical- and skill-oriented goals throughout the offseason based on the time of the year.
Just because one athlete moves weight now doesn’t mean we don’t need a period of training focused on strength and power; just because another guy is leaner than a bean pole doesn’t mean he won’t have periods dedicated to skill work.
All right, so we understand goals, we understand training based on the time of year, now how do we put it all together?
There are thousands, if not more, situations you’ll face as a coach when it comes to programming since each athlete is different. However, to lay down some guidelines that should help you out, let’s break things down into three examples of athletes: novice, intermediate, and advanced.
Novice athletes are your younger, weaker, less physically developed athletes. These are the athletes whose developmental goals are primarily physical. Their focus needs to be on gaining size and developing strength. Skill work is limited here. Yes, everyone wants to pull down and see the radar gun light up, but at this stage in the development process, less throwing is more for them. What we want to do is build a base level of size, strength, and movement quality for later athletic development.
Remember, each athlete has a limited training economy and a ton of high-intent–high-volume throwing work is going to take away from and slow development in the weight room. Relegate these athletes to movement quality work with Plyo Ball ® and limit high-intent throwing days during early stages of offseason training.
These are the athletes coaches most often struggle to program for. They have decent levels of hypertrophy, but they are not exceptionally strong in the weight room while also lacking in skill-specific goals as well. These athletes are going to need a more periodized programming approach than the novice athletes did.
For example, one of the ways we’ll program this in facility is by beginning the offseason with a focus on strength development. At this point there will be higher levels of volume in the strength training, and throwing should be tapered down to one or fewer high-intent days.
After that, training block-power development can be applied. With less volume in the weight room, you can begin to increase the volume of high-intent throwing. Although remember, we need to be careful about increasing the volume too much on the throwing side at this point, or we’ll spend all our training-economy cash and the athlete won’t get the power increase in the weight room we need for later training blocks.
In the third training block, we continue to focus on power or speed, but at a greatly reduced volume. This allows us to really hammer out skill work on the throwing side. Two or more high-intent days a week, bullpens, flat grounds, etc. This is where athletes make strides. All the strength and power work they developed in the last few months should now be applied to their throwing. Note, this reduction in weight-room volume is also what every athlete should be doing in a preseason training block, including the novice athlete.
Advanced athletes are your athletes who have great levels of strength and power in the weight room but are lacking in skill traits: whether that be velocity, command, or pitch development. Regardless of the goal, weight-room work will be similar to the example block three for intermediate athletes: low volume, high intent, with a focus on skill work.
Again, training will be adjusted based on the time of the year. Novice athletes won’t strictly be doing high volume all year, intermediate athletes won’t always work straight through those three training blocks, and advanced athletes will need periods of higher volume in the weight room to rebuild strength and power lost during the season.
The take away though is that an athlete’s throwing volume and intent work needs to change based off what he’s doing in the weight room if you want to get the most out of him.
High volume on both sides will crush an athlete, and you’ll see performance numbers on both ends fall.
Determine the most important needs for each athlete and program accordingly. Remember, it’s about the development of every individual athlete, so taking some time away from skill or weight-room work to lay the foundations of future training is a must.

Nice article. Love the $ bill analogy. Very tangible.
Great content. One aspect that always seems difficult is with collegiate programs, 1 strength coach vs. 30+ athletes from the weak novice freshman to the 5th year senior, strong as an ox. Unfortunately too often they’re all on the same program from top to bottom. This in turn creates a much less than optimal return on investment. Economy model is great way to look at this. I agree also the intermediate group is sometimes most difficult even from a psychological standpoint. They’re often the ones that want to ramp up beyond what they may be ready for because they are at the level that they want to see that next big jump since they’re beyond the “beginner gains” phase of their physical development. As always great stuff here. Keep spreading the good word and opening the dialogue.
[…] This isn’t to say that flatgrounds don’t have any place in practice, but they are often overused. We can all remember the teammate who “one more his way-ed” to 10 more sliders on flatground to get the movement right. This isn’t going to be a beneficial use of an athlete’s training economy. […]
[…] Proper programming is essential. Forcing an athlete to throw 120 pitches and do a high-volume weight-training program in one week is a recipe for disaster and diminished performance.  […]

Velocity Based Training for Baseball Athletes - Driveline Baseball,2017-04-13T02:34:47+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/04/velocity-based-training-for-baseball-athletes/,"Absolute strength is a crucial stage in an athlete’s development; however, the stimulus will need to change as an athlete gets further into their career. Absolute strength is a great tool for young athletes to develop high force production, neuromuscular efficiency, and lean-body-mass gains. Solely focusing on absolute strength is not the best tool for intermediate and elite level athletes, because after a few years these measurable gains will undoubtedly plateau.
Elite athletes have often adapted to the stimulus of absolute strength, and to keep on pushing for greater strength gains takes away from their work capacity.
The weight room supplements the throwing; it should never take away from the throwing.
As we grappled with how to further enhance athlete performance from the weight room to throwing, Kyle Boddy and I came across Dr. Bryan Mann’s book on Velocity Based Training (VBT). We thought this could be a huge enhancement for some of our more advanced athletes and further push their on-field performance.
(This post was written by Jack Scheideman, High Performance Trainer at Driveline Baseball)
Different speeds train different qualities of the athlete, and to train for maximum performance, choose appropriate velocities. The SAID principle states that the body will adapt to the Specific Adaptation of the Imposed Demands. Based off of what velocity you choose, train the quality that is designated with that specific velocity.
For example, training for starting strength has minimal carryover for absolute strength, because you are training the opposite quality. Choosing the correct velocity based off of training age is crucial for an athlete’s success. If you don’t, you will not be training the athlete in an appropriate way for his maximum development.
Let’s break these strengths down.
Absolute strength is defined as moving the heaviest weight that the athlete can move one time, or his 1RM. This speed usually occurs in the .13-.35 m/sec, depending on the athlete’s qualities. Absolute strength is the fundamental quality for all the other strength and speed qualities that follow. Absolute strength needs to be the first quality that a young athlete trains, as it can have huge carryover.
The athlete, by training absolute strength, is attempting to train to produce more maximal force.
This is crucial since the athlete needs to be able to produce a lot of force to be successful. However, there will be a time in an athlete’s career when absolute strength will not have minimal transfer to his performance.
Transfer of training showing different correlations of exercises to throwing distance.
Based on the table above. an elite-level shot putter could be considered to throw 19+ meters; shot putters also need a much higher level of absolute strength then baseball pitchers. This is because a shot put weighs 16 pounds and moves at a much slower velocity than a baseball. As you can see, a 1rm back squat had very little transfer as the athlete became elite. Once a sufficient level of absolute strength is acquired, the athlete needs to train other aspects of the force-velocity curve.
Submaximal training is when the athlete is near a max of .35-.45 m/sec. These reps are difficult, but the athlete is not in danger of failing a rep. These are usually done in the 2-3 rep range, where the athlete is training to improve his absolute strength. Circa-max phases are crucial to improving the athlete’s absolute strength, as absolute strength work can not be trained very frequently. Going for maximal weights is very taxing on the central nervous system, so the majority of the work is done in the circa-max velocities. This has a carryover to your absolute strength, because they are in similar velocities zones.
Velocities of acceleration strength are in the .5-.75 m/sec, which constitutes a relatively heavy weight that an athlete is still able to accelerate. The weight will be heavy but not too close to absolute strength since the bar will never slow down or stop, as in absolute strength. Bryan Mann gives a great example of a defensive lineman in football. When they accelerate at the snap, they move at 1.5 m/sec as they make contact and dominate the offensive lineman they accelerate through them at 0.6 m/sec. This case only happens if the defensive lineman is able to dominate the offensive lineman; if they don’t dominate them, it turns into an absolute strength quality.
The quality of strength-speed occurs when the bar is moving from .75 to 1 m/sec, and it is classified by strength in the condition of speed. It is moving a moderate load at maximal speeds, in which the bar constantly accelerates through the concentric movement. Because of this, it has a higher rate of force development. This is where most, if not all, dynamic effort days fall into. This is because strength-speed is highly transferable to both producing more force and being able to produce that force faster. It lies in the middle of our force velocity curve, so it is inherently the first speed we select with a new athlete starting a VBT program. Once that athlete has already trained for absolute strength, the methods of circa-max strength and acceleration strength can come into play.
The quality of speed-strength is achieved when the bar velocity is moving between 1-1.3 m/sec, and it is classified by speed in the condition of strength. It uses lighter weights than strength-speed which increases bar velocity. It has the second-highest rate of force development behind starting-strength. Usually to create this speed, you have to use some type of accommodating resistance—either bands, chains or weight releasers. This allows the athlete to have less weight at the bottom in order to accelerate the bar from the start of the concentric movement. As the bar is accelerated, the athlete is able to maintain the velocity as it accelerates through the accommodating resistance.
Starting strength is achieved when the athlete is able to accelerate the implement greater than 1.5 m/sec, which is the ability to overcome inertia from a dead stop. This makes it the highest rate of force development possible. Many elements in athletics require this velocity range when throwing a hammer, baseball, or swinging a bat. It is also one of the hardest elements to train in a weight room: because of the speed required, the weight needs to be extremely light. This speed is mainly neurologically based and usually inappropriate to train in the weight room. Rather, most athletes would benefit from speed-strength or strength-speed since these qualities produce more power. Most athletes will train the quality of starting-strength through their competitive event, either throwing different weighted balls or different weighted bats. We choose not to train it in the weight room because athletes get this work in through sport specific exercises.
We are currently measuring speed and power of the lifts with a Tendo Power Analyzer. This gives us average velocity and power, peak power and velocity, and eccentric velocity measurements that we can use to track our athletes. We are able to connect it to your computer with a Bluetooth™ device and track the progression of the athletes as they go through a cycle. There are many other, cheaper velocity-tracking devices such as GymAware, PUSH band, or Beast Sensor, and we are currently testing their validity.
Velocity-based training (VBT) allows athletes to pick weights based off the speed quality that the athlete is attempting to train at—we will go into these qualities later. This system replaces a percentage-based system where the weights are pre-selected.
The athlete warms up with the Tendo unit connected to the bar and picks the weights based off the speed. During the session, if the athlete goes below or above the selected speed, adjustments are made with the weight to make sure we are training the correct velocity quality.
VBT is a constant adjustment based off of how the athlete is performing that day, whereas a percentage-based system can’t make adjustments from objective data.
There are three main areas where using velocity-based training yields better results than percentage-based training.
1. Accuracy: Percentages are inherently based off speed; intensity is directly correlated to the mean concentric speed of the lift. But using VBT allows us to pick more appropriate weights on our dynamic effort days. Now each day an athlete trains using VBT with a Tendo power analyzer, the athlete is training using the section of the force continuum that we have programmed.
2. Daily fluctuations: The reason that percentage-based training is not as accurate is because there are daily fluctuations in an athlete’s one-rep max (1RM). This is because our nervous system has daily fluctuations due to overtraining, nutrition, lifestyle, and a number of other factors. Using VBT allows us to get an idea of how these stressors affect an athlete, because they will show up in their readings. You are not able to lift your max every day. So, if you base your percentages off of one-rep maximum, estimations of that day’s maximum capacity will be less accurate than testing velocity of the barbell and the selected weights for the session.
3: Risk: There are two reasons that percentage-based training can be risky: First, your percentages fluctuate everyday. So if you select 90% of 1RM, and your 1RM that day is actually 95% of your assumed 1RM, you are much more likely to break down in technique and can be easily overtrained.
1RM testing can also be very risky for young athletes who do not have consistent technique on the lift. This can easily lead to injury. So, if you don’t test it, then you can’t choose appropriate weights on dynamic-effort day. Remember the weight-room supplemental training that athletes are already doing on the throwing side.
Dynamic effort is defined as moving a sub-maximal load at maximal speed. This is usually paired on a different maximal-effort day where you work above 90% of 1rm or 0.15-.35 m/sec. The Westside program is set up in a lower/upper split, where either the upper or lower body is the focus that day.
For example, Monday: max effort upper; Wednesday: dynamic effort lower; Thursday: dynamic effort upper; Saturday: max effort lower. Popularized by Westside Barbell and Louie Simmons, this style continues to drive maximal strength but also works different qualities of the force-velocity curve to improve rate-of-force development.
We had already been programming based on a Westside template before we got the Tendo Power Analyzer by using velocities to train velocity qualities. Athletes were using a progression of 1RM on dynamic-effort day.
For a back squat, for example, the athletes were doing eight sets of two reps on week: 40% of one rep max; week two: 45% of one rep max; week three: 50% of one rep max; and then a new cycle would begin. On the maximal-effort days, athletes were working to above 90% of 1RM for doubles or triples based off of the cycle.
At the time we were seeing athletes getting much stronger but not necessarily throwing much harder; it wasn’t translating to their performance as we would have liked.
We thought this may have been happening because of two main reasons:
While the Westside template has been proven to produce great results in the powerlifting community, it doesn’t necessarily transfer to pitchers who also have an aggressive throwing program or do not currently have reasonable strength levels.
Athletes can become good at many things, but not everything. There needs to be a focus in each cycle: if throwing volume or intensity goes up for an athlete, something needs to be taken out, and this will usually come from the weight room. After analyzing an athlete’s performance, we evolved into using VBT to maximize performance on the field.
[clickToTweet tweet=”If throwing volume or intensity goes up, activities in the weight room must be taken out.” quote=”If throwing volume or intensity goes up, activities in the weight room must be taken out.”]
Autoregulation, with VBT, is a way of monitoring athletes’ workloads by monitoring the velocities of their lifts. These velocities should be monitored during workouts, and from workout to workout, to make sure overtraining does not occur.
During workouts, we select a weight based off of the speed for that day—let’s say 0.8-0.9 m/sec, which is considered a strength-speed day based on the chart above. The workout officially starts after the athlete has added enough weight to reach the chosen speed. The athlete does a maximum of 12 sets of 2 reps on the minute, or until he drops below the designated speed—whichever comes first. Once one of those occurs, the athlete’s workout will then be over. This makes sure that the athlete is only working the speed trait that we want (see table above) and that the athlete does not become overtrained. This is a great way to monitor workload especially when participating in a high-intensity throwing program.
Based off of the data that you have been tracking, you are able to monitor athletes from workout to workout. For example, if last week the athlete is moving the bar at .8 m/sec with 225 and this week he is moving 225 at .6 m/sec, you can see the athlete is clearly not recovering and adapting from last week’s work. You can end the workout there because clearly overtraining has occurred, or you can go for a lighter weight at 0.8 m/sec than last week. From there you can look through workout logs and see if he was not ready for VBT or there was too much volume and/or intensity. This can also lead to a great discussion with the athlete about lifestyle choices and how to set up for the best recovery.
If the athlete has two reps, one at .78 and one at .81, then the workout will continue if the target velocity was .8-.9. The athlete needs to have two consecutive reps below 90% of 0.8 for the workout to end. The athlete would then end his workout if there were two reps below 0.72 m/sec. Some reps can just be a bad technically, so we want to see that athlete has two bad technical reps for the workout to end.
External cues for an athlete are powerful tools that can either enhance technique, with proper cueing, or hurt technique. These cues during a lift can be “knees out,” “sit back” on a back squat, or “tuck your elbows” on a bench press. These are important cues for novice athletes who need to learn the proper movement patterns to maximize their lifting progress. Once athletes have been lifting for years, these cues are still important, but to continue to progress in the weight room, other cues can have a greater effect.
An external focus/competition is greater for the intermediate/elite athlete and is where the Tendo Power Analyzer has been great tool for our athletes. By positioning the Tendo screen where the athlete can see the velocity, the athlete gets immediate feedback on whether the rep was successful or not. By doing this, he gets an external-focused cue, and by doing so, he might change his technique or mindset to maximize his performance.
This is very similar to having radar boards all over Driveline: athletes will change their technique based off of the external focus without being force fed external cues. This allows athletes to learn how to move in their best way to maximize their performance.
By having this external focus, the athlete has constant competition with himself and other athletes to move more weight faster. This creates a culture in the weight room where when athletes get to work, they have to push themselves, because the numbers won’t lie. Competition with other athletes is also important. By pairing up athletes with similar strength levels, they can compete with each other in order to maximize their performance.
With these objective measurements with the Tendo, the athlete is able to analyze the workout and decide whether it was successful or not:
These questions now have objective numbers where the athlete can ask himself these questions and have answer to them. This creates constant progression between the coach and athlete. If they are not progressing, it is the coach’s job to take a step back and first look at the program to see if it is inappropriate. Then the coach can look at the athlete’s lifestyle, etc, and adjust the program based off of the athlete’s specific needs. These objective measurements allow the coach and athlete to constantly analyze performance.
The novice athlete does not need to focus on rate of force development because absolute strength in a novice athlete takes care of this. The novice athlete will not have the strength or technique to move a heavy enough weight at a fast velocity. Think of a young, untrained athlete: when his absolute strength increases and his lean body mass increases, his speed will usually increase.
You are likely to see a novice athlete improve his broad jump, 60 yard dash, throwing velocity, and bat speed through just training absolute strength. However as we have seen with Dr. Bondarchuk’s table (see above), once they become elite, absolute strength will have very little transfer to the athletes. This is where VBT comes into play.
Think about a large semi truck vs. a Ferrari: a semi produces lots of power but does so very slowly; a Ferrari produces less power but is able to apply a high percentage of its force rapidly. Our goal is to help athletes be like a semi in their novice years to become able to produce a lot of force. Then, they transition into becoming like a Ferrari, where we are able to take that large amount of force and train to produce it rapidly. If you train like a Ferrari too early, you still won’t produce a lot of force, so it doesn’t matter how fast you can apply it.
Once an athlete has a good base of absolute strength, it is now time to work on his rate-of-force development. Rate of force development is a measure of explosive strength, or how fast an athlete is able to produce force. These adaptations occur because the athlete improves his stretch-shortening cycle by improving his neural drive, or muscle fiber type, or muscle fiber area. Athletes with higher rate-of-force development have been shown to have more success in athletics because they are able to produce more power. Athletes with more power production are more likely to throw harder or swing a bat faster.
As you can see in the graph above, if you are able to train rate-of-force development the force velocity curve will go up and to the left. This means that the athlete is able to produce more force faster (source).
When an athlete first steps into Driveline, absolute strength will always be the first goal. If they have not already achieved this, then they will transfer into a VBT program to work on rate-of-force development.
The graph above shows that through proper strength and power training, the athlete will improve his force-velocity curve at a greater rate than an athlete just training for speed. By implementing a VBT program, the athlete will continue to improve his absolute strength but also improve his rate-of-force development. This allows the athlete to produce the most power possible.
This is accomplished by working in the correct velocity zones we talked about earlier in order to maximize power production. When athletes first enter our VBT program, they will stay within three velocity ranges: absolute strength, strength-speed, and speed-strength.
Absolute strength is in the program so that we can continue increase their 1RM. This is so that their speed-strength and strength-speed will continue to increase. If an athlete’s 1rm stays the same, he will plateau fairly quickly with speed-strength and strength-speed because the athlete will not be able to move 80% of 1RM in the strength-speed velocity.
We use strength-speed on our major three lifts: Deadlift, Back Squat, and Bench Press. When an athlete first starts, we mainly stay with the strength-speed velocities because they are able to produce more power with these speeds. This is because their speed-strength would be too light of weight on any lift to have high-power production. As we progress we will add in speed-strength to the big three lifts by mainly using accommodating resistance bands/chains. While we have used a trap bar jump for speed-strength when an athlete first jumps in VBT, our main focus is strength-speed.
Our periodization model for VBT is a progressive overload in which the athlete tries to add weight to the bar between sets or from week to week. This allows for constant increases in power production so we can get the greatest benefit from that day. It is imperative that the weights are picked wisely: They need to be hitting the velocity that you have selected. We also use the autoregulation technique that I discussed earlier.
Here is an example program for someone who is just starting to enter a VBT program. These are just the major lifts; I will not add in the assistance work because this depends on an athlete’s needs.
Monday: Max Effort
Back squat: 65% 5 reps, 75% 5 reps, 85% 5+ reps

The main goal here is to rest and recover from the last cycle. Ideally this deload will also happen during a throwing deload for proper recovery. Here, you should lower the volume of the speed lift and the intensity on the max effort days.

When would you use single leg lifts in the program? Are they part of this program or is it just the main 3 lifts. For example, I usually add split squat and a few others, so which day would I do the single leg exercises?
Brett- Generally, it will be those 3 main lifts. You could use split squats in place of squats, which we have done. One issue we see with this is athletes compensating form for speed. You will see the back arch out as they are trying to move the bar as fast as possible. You can always use some additional exercises that focus on single leg range of motion and stability.

Individualization in Athletics: Potential Points of Failure - Driveline Baseball,2017-04-06T11:24:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/04/individualization-in-athletics-potential-points-of-failure/,"Individiualization.
It’s the solution to everything in coaching. Trainees want to be treated as individuals with specific needs and get personal attention to solve their issues, and coaches promise it to them in droves. Personalized workouts, custom-built templates, individualized programs, everything is based around the individual and tailored to their needs.
This isn’t a bad thing, by and large. Bad CrossFit boxes ignore this and program Workouts of the Day (WODs) blanket across their population and get people hurt doing high-rep Olympic weightlifting. Good ones understand a reasonable on-ramping procedure and the importance of mobility as drilled by famous CrossFitters like Dr. Kelly Starrett. Baseball is much the same – bad facilities, college programs, and pro teams treat their players like cattle, while good ones understand each individual responds differently not only physically, but emotionally and mentally as well.
Individualization is now “baked in” to most good programs, where a pre-determined template is configured around an athlete’s needs based on screenings or other key performance indicators. This is a great way to show individual attention to an athlete, gain efficiency, and scale the trainer’s business in a reasonable way. Doing from-scratch individual programs won’t scale for more than 20 athletes (at most) per trainer, and handing out copied templates to everyone won’t get the best results (and client retention will go to crap).
Our flagship training program, Hacking the Kinetic Chain, has tons of examples of this in the website’s back-end database:
Example program list in HTKC
Example of a program in HTKC
Unfortunately, there are two cases where this type of “individualization” can fail, and it happens on both extremes of the continuum of athlete success.
Legendary trainer Mark Rippetoe (Starting Strength, Practical Programming for Strength Training) described the training phases an athlete goes through, guided solely by the stimulus response the trainee is encountering. These labels are not good or bad, but merely talks about how programming must be modified – individualized, if you will – for the trainee depending on how he/she responds to stressors.
Here’s how I see the training phases:
If it wasn’t clear, it goes Novice -> Advanced Novice -> Intermediate -> Elite Intermediate -> Advanced in order of increasing complexity.
Individualizing a novice’s workout is completely counter-productive. The Novice Phase period is where you can literally pile on a ton of basic work and they’ll get amazing stimulus from the simple stuff in addition to the fact that mastering the basic movements is a prerequisite for doing anything fancy down the line, and retraining movement patterns is way tougher than training them for the first time.
If a pitcher is 15 years old, sitting 68 MPH, and is weak with very limited throwing volume in the past, keep it very simple and very repeatable. Individualizing workouts here only serves to distract the client, usually with the intention of providing perceived added value so the trainer can keep booking sessions and padding his wallet. The athlete really doesn’t need a coach here. He needs self-motivation and consistent work in the weight room, dinner table, and football field long tossing.
This off-season we saw a very successful professional pitcher (not Brandon McCarthy above, though he’s a client) who had serious velocity loss. When he arrived for assessment and screening, we put him through our manual testing and our two-dimensional video-based kinematic automated screening. This athlete presented with a unique profile relative to our professional athlete metrics database:
Frankly stated, none of our “individual” programs would be useful for this athlete, since our templates are largely geared towards attacking the Advanced Novice through Intermediate (and some Elite Intermediate) profiles which makes up the vast majority of our training population. This athlete does not have any glaring mechanical weaknesses when pitching, and even if he did, he was an older and very successful MLB pitcher who wouldn’t be able to tolerate movement retraining at this time.
While the general throwing drills outlined in Hacking the Kinetic Chain were used with our Plyo Ball ®, we had to make some specific adjustments to the program that fall outside of the usual scope of how we attack weaknesses. Low internal rotational torque values are not common in professional athletes; if they have a deficit, it usually presents itself in external rotation strength, which is a more sensitive measure of projecting future arm injury than simple range of motion testing (ex: GIRD testing). Most pitchers have the ability to internally rotate with power, since that is the nature of their job. In this case, limited throwing on-ramping was part of this, but the pitcher was already throwing in competitive situations. To attack this weakness, we prescribed manual isometric work at specific joint angles applying internal rotation torque against a fixed object and heavily-biased his throwing load with overload objects – 450g and 225g Plyo Ball ® and 6-11 oz. leather weighted baseballs in catch play. We also stayed away from maximum effort throwing such as pulldown / running throw work, since it wasn’t a specific way to attack the issue at hand.
Our High-Performance trainers that worked with the pitcher used manual therapy techniques (FAKTR, PRI, specific trigger work) to help restore trunk rotation range of motion, which was very effective. We then blended that with throwing drills to ensure the gain in ROM would express itself dynamically on the mound, and used high-speed video to check this metric.
However, while velocity was ticking up significantly in just two days of assessment and work, trunk rotation wasn’t being maximized. This is where years of experience with professional pitchers and having a wide base of knowledge can be very useful in practice despite the situation never specifically coming up in the past.
I was working on integrating all of the modalities together, and since rotation was still not being expressed dynamically, I decided to use the a style of training that I thought could maximize transfer: a type of French Contrast training. Named after French sports scientist Gilles Cometti, this is a method of training that seeks to maximize rate of force development and power. While these benefits are useful, they were not the main reason I chose to use a contrast method of training; contrast training is also a very good way to layer general movements to skilled movements to improve the transfer of training in a shorter period of time.
We had this pitcher do the following contrast cycles:
After five cycles of this while tweaking the reps/sets scheme as the pitcher tired, he posted a +8 MPH gain (still not his working velocity, but a big increase!) in just a single day of working. The athlete didn’t get any stronger or faster in a few days of training, but professional athletes competing at the highest level almost always have the potential inside of them – it just requires figuring out how to attack the movement patterns, restrictions, or other issues preventing it from being expressed.
The pitcher left with a four-week program to continue improving strength/power metrics, throwing-specific metrics, and proprioception work to do on his own, truly individualized for an elite athlete. Coaches who work with elite talent should be well-read and must keep up with new training ideas in case they need that Swiss army knife in the back pocket – just know that you should only be using the tools very sporadically. If you find yourself using new ideas on a regular basis, your templating base of training needs to be better tested, re-tested, and documented.

Upper Body Pulling Exercises: Everything Rows and How To Progress Them - Driveline Baseball,2017-04-04T03:54:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/04/upper-body-pulling-exercises-everything-rows-progress/,"We have all heard the saying “you have to row to grow.” While this statement holds truth, rowing exercises play a pivotal role in performance, injury prevention, and movement quality. Rowing variations are also one of the most commonly butchered exercises, and without proper technique, the carryover of benefits will be minimal at best.
The main muscles targeted in rowing variations are the latissimus dorsi (lats), rhomboids, and trapezius (traps). While building these muscles will increase overall performance, their main throwing functions are to assist in scapular upward rotation and decelerating the arm. While scapular movement is a topic for another post, heavy rows allow overhead athletes to load the scapula directly without compromising the glenohumeral joint—and that is worth mentioning.
In addition to increasing strength and hypertrophy in the lats, rhomboids, and mid traps, heavy rows also increase the strength of stabilizing muscles around the shoulder joint and help keep the humeral head centered within the glenoid fossa. This will help keep range of motion sufficient in both internal and external rotation, which is sometimes lost and/or gained due to repetitive throwing.
The first rowing variation we will discuss is the inverted row. Just as the push up is a great upper-body pushing exercise for determining relative strength, the inverted row shows one’s ability to pull his own body weight. The inverted row is great for both beginners who might not have the ability to pull a heavy-external load and for advanced lifters who want to improve relative strength and core stability. Because the inverted row requires maintaining a strong base and neutral spine, core stability is a huge component to performing the exercise.
Set up a barbell inside a rack at about hip height. Lay down and grab the bar with a slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip. Begin the pull by pulling the shoulder blades down and back to engage the lats. Keep the core tight, and pull your chest to the bar.
Inverted Row Start
Inverted Row Finish
Moving on from the inverted row, let’s discuss single-arm cable rows. The biggest benefit of cable rows are the ability to perform multiple variations. Cable rows can be performed in a standing position, half-kneeling position, or split-stance position. By switching up those variations, we can either progress or regress by either incorporating more core stability in a half-kneeling position or a heavier load in a standing- or split-stance position. Most cable machines can also be adjusted to high or low settings. By varying this component, athletes can pull from different angles, putting the shoulder in different positions, and thus strengthening the rotator cuff by forcing it to grab on and keep the humeral head stable.
Standing Cable Row Start
Inverted Cable Row Finish
Half-Kneeling Cable Row Start
Half-Kneeling Cable Row Finish
Be sure to get a full range of motion, but do not pull the weight too far. If the elbow extends too far past the body, the humeral head will rotate forward, putting the shoulder in a compromising position.
Split-Squat Cable Row Start
Split-Squat Cable Row Finish
Arguably the most functional of the rowing variations is the 3-point dumbbell row. The 3-point dumbbell row is where we begin to increase the external load and get into more of our maximum-strength work. Because the load is heavier, the benefits we talked about before with the inverted row and cable row are even greater.  With a full range of motion, we will achieve greater scapular retraction. The rotator cuff has to work harder to stabilize the humeral head at greater loads. In order to maintain a strong and stable base in the 3-point position, we must activate our erector spinae muscles. In addition, because the 3-point dumbbell row is unilateral and we can load it heavier, we get an increase in core stability through anti-rotation. The 3-point dumbbell row is possibly the most “bang for your buck” exercise.
3-Point Dumbbell Row Start
3-Point Dumbbell Row Finish
Place your opposite hand on bench and slightly bend both knees. Maintain a neutral spine, and keep the core engaged. This position also places an emphasis on the hip hinge. When beginning the movement, engage your lat and drive the dumbbell up and back towards your hip to maintain tension. Get a good stretch at the bottom of the movement to emphasize scap retraction.
Finally, the exercise that has arguably the biggest carryover in strength and hypertrophy is the barbell row. Contrary to other rowing variations that are unilateral movements, the barbell row is a bilateral movement that works both sides of the body simultaneously. Because of this, the external load will be greatest with the barbell row. Where the 3-point dumbbell row increases core stability through anti-rotation, the barbell row increases core stability through anti-extension. The spinae erectors are extremely active throughout this movement as the body is maintaining a strong base in a hip hinge, similar to a 3-point dumbbell row but without the support of the opposite hand.
Barbell Row Start
Barbell Row Finish
Starting with the bar racked, grab the bar with a slightly wider-than-shoulder-width grip. Hip hinge by pushing the hips back and keeping the chest big. With the chest at about 45 degrees, engage the lats and core to maintain a neutral spine. Pull the bar back and towards your bellybutton to maintain tension throughout the lats and rhomboids. A normal grip will target the lats most, a reverse grip will target the biceps more directly, and a wider grip will target more of the upper back and traps.

"Baseball In-Season Lifting Program: Managing Volume, Intensity, and Fatigue - Driveline Baseball",2017-03-21T02:03:56+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/03/season-lifting-managing-volume-intensity-fatigue/,"How can we continue the progress made in the off-season by creating a good baseball in-season lifting program? What variables matter when creating a good in season baseball workout?
These questions get asked every March when the college season is well underway, most high-school tryouts have completed, and spring-training games, along with the World Baseball Classic, have all kicked off. It’s one of the best times of the year and one of those times that gives both strength coaches and athletes alike a bit of trouble when it comes to figuring out what to do about their training.  It’s not always an easy task to know what to do.
On one hand, athletes have just put in (hopefully) a lot of quality off-season work and made big strides in their development. Obviously, we want to maintain and, if possible, continue to develop throughout the season. However, on the other hand, you’re also usually dumping a ton of more sport-specific work on top of your athletes by adding the rigors of practice to their schedule.
Let’s be honest, we all know the coach who loves to have the four-hour practice, or the classic “mental toughness” hell week on the first week back. So, how do we program for this, and can we even continue lifting during season and make strides?
The answer is a resounding “yes.” We can lift during the season, but there are considerations we need to make. The first, and in my mind most important, is fatigue. We need to be aware of the amount of fatigue placed upon our athletes and how that fatigue is actually accumulated in the weight room.
In general, athletes are competing anywhere from three to seven times a week. That takes a toll on your body and there’s no way you’re going to be able to maintain the lifting program you were doing in the offseason while continuing to perform at optimal levels on the field. We need to change focus to create a productive baseball in season lifting program.
The first instinct for most athletes is to go lighter in the weight room. That is, they cut the weight down and bang out more sets with more reps but at a lighter weight. This seems legit. Lighter weight is obviously less fatiguing, right? Maybe— then again maybe not.
If I squat 275lbs for 3 sets of 10, and I work up to that weight in a progression of 135×10, 225×10, 275 3×10, I perform a total work volume of 11,850lbs.
If I perform higher-intensity squats, but lower reps, say 365 for 3×3, and work up in a progression of 135×5, 225×5, 275×3, 315×3, 365×3, I get a total work volume of 6,135lbs.
That’s almost half the volume of work performed even though I completed four more sets and I’m working with a load almost 100lbs heavier. Performing half the volume of work, even at a higher intensity, is obviously far less fatiguing than performing a greater volume with lighter weight.
This also carries over to the number of exercises you perform. Performing one-to-two compound lifts and three-to-four accessory exercises is fine for the offseason, but that volume may be a bit excessive when the athlete is also standing for three hours at practice and making additional throws and sprints that they weren’t making a month ago when they were training aggressively.
With that said though, when it comes to the intensity of an in season baseball workout, I prefer to have our athletes keep two-to-four reps in the tank. Don’t get me wrong, there are times when you need to struggle to complete that last rep, and there are times when you need to dial it back just a smidge.
A lot of athletes don’t like doing this. They’re super intense every time they’re in the gym, and they’re pushing their bodies to the absolute limits, whether they’re in-season or out of season, because they’ve been conditioned that this is the only way to make gains.
But the research suggests that training this way every time you’re in the gym accumulates a ton of fatigue pretty quickly. Not only is pushing that last rep to failure taxing the body far more than saving two reps in the tank, but also, maybe a bit surprisingly, is the fact that you don’t accumulate that much, if any, extra strength gains by going that extra mile regularly.
The other question to tackle is when to lift and the amount of days to do so. For the most part, athletes lift one-to-three days in-season, regardless of being a starter, reliever, or position player. This is inevitably going to be fluid with the competition schedule since we’re not looking to train three times a week when you’re a reliever and your team’s playing five games that week.
The same goes for the polar opposite when you train once that week when you have only two games that weekend. The key is to be smart about your programming and adjust the days you lift accordingly.
So now that we’ve covered the basic nitty-gritty weight-room stuff, let’s talk about the actual key to lifting in season. Don’t be an dummy. Whether you’re a starting pitcher, position player, or reliever, this is the most important factor in determining an athlete’s success.
For example, maybe you’re a reliever who had a big conference weekend and pitched Friday and Sunday, throwing four more innings and fifty pitches more than normal, and still need to be recovered for a mid-week game on Wednesday. Drop a set or two from your workout, and give your body additional time to recover.
Maybe Johnny Baseball got caught breaking a team rule mid-week and coach set the tone for the entire team by having you run poles for an hour after practice, but there’s a lift the next day and a three-game weekend series one day after that. Bang some sets out from that workout and let your body recover.
Don’t misunderstand me, I’m not trying to give athletes an excuse to be buttery soft and skip an in season baseball workout, but what I am detailing is that to be able to execute a baseball in season lifting program, maintain a high level of performance, and still seek some gains, you need to make smart choices and manage your fatigue appropriately.
Don’t be the athlete who mismanages their fatigue, has wild 8 mph velocity swings from one appearance to the next, and spends half of practice complaining about his mechanics being off and doing the towel drill to try and fix it all because his velocity is down.
Lastly, get some sleep. There are stressors that affect each of us daily, and sleep often takes a back seat when it comes to training, practice, travel, and school. Get as much of it as you can. You’d be surprised how much better you feel and how much better your performance in the weight room and on the field is when you get to bed early and grab nine hours of shut-eye instead of spending an evening with Johnny Baseball and only getting six.

"Everything Push-Up: why you need it, how to teach it, ways to progress it – Part II - Driveline Baseball",2017-03-08T04:53:18+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/03/everything-push-need-teach-ways-progress-part-ii/,"Part I of this series covered the basis of why the Push-Up is such a beneficial exercise for the developing baseball player – and really, any athlete in general. The benefits discussed ranged from teaching postural awareness to enhancing lumbopelvic control and trunk stability, from improving relative upper-body strength to incorporating proper scapulothoracic and glenohumeral movement. The Push-Up truly is an over-achiever in the “bang-for-your-buck” department.
Additionally, Part I covered a teaching progression for coaches and athletes who are beginners in terms of training experience. The main point of emphasis was to improve all aspects of the Push-Up (trunk stability, upper-body strength, postural awareness) simultaneously by using appropriate progression.
Today’s installment, the second and final piece of this series, is more of the “practical” component of these articles, with less discussion, and more examples of Push-Up progressions.
The following variations of the Push-Up only include subtle changes/challenges to the base movement. In this way, they don’t over-challenge the system so that it fails and breaks, but add enough of a challenge to stimulate growth in the movement.
Push-Up Plus
Quite honestly, the Push-Up Plus is how the Push-Up itself should always be performed. As discussed in the previous article, one of the Push-Up’s strongest benefits is the freedom for scapular movement. In contrast with the Bench Press (where the scapulae are locked down in retraction for the duration of the movement), the Push-Up allows the scaps to protract and retract. The scaps, then, should protract at the top of the Push-Up each rep, but oftentimes this is cut short. The Push-Up Plus seeks to emphasize scapular protraction and a natural curving of the thoracic spine with each rep.
Yoga Push-Up
The Yoga Push-Up, or “Push-Up + A-Frame/Downward Dog” accomplishes a couple of things: for starters, it makes for a great mobility exercise for the scaps (upward rotation is needed to effectively reach full shoulder flexion) and thoracic spine (through extension). These are the more well known benefits of the movement.
But, I also use the Yoga Push-Up in my programs as a way to progress the trunk stability and postural awareness components of the High Plank and Push-Up. Once an athlete has established competency in holding the High Plank or performing the Push-Up, I will use the A-Frame/Downward Dog position to destabilize that strong postural alignment that they have built, and then force them to come back to the position and “find it” again. Before adding any perturbations or external resistances, I’d much prefer to destabilize their postural holds through rhythmic and predictable patterns of movement (i.e. going from High Plank to Downward Dog and back, repeat…), as this is a much more conservative progression of movement.
External loading is a great way to challenge both the upper-body strength and trunk stability components of the Push-Up. But, we must be careful to select appropriate loading. Just as the traditional bodyweight Push-Up may be too much loading for a beginner (e.g. the trunk sags), so too can excessive loading be too much for the intermediate. The following three loading parameters move in descending order, beginning with my preferred method of adding external loading.
Band- or Chain-Loaded Push-Up
The Banded or Chained Push-Up is my preferred method for adding external loads to the Push-Up, as they do not impede the scapulae from moving freely in the Push-Up. And, as scapular freedom is one of the main reasons ballplayers should use the Push-Up, I try to keep it a focal point.
Weighted Push-Up
The only real downside to the Weighted Push-Up (with weight plates) is the potential to prevent the scaps from moving freely.
Feet-Elevated Push-Up
While this progression does sufficiently challenge most athletes in terms of upper-body strength, it is often butchered with either too high of an elevation or a complete loss of trunk stability and postural alignment. If I am going to incorporate this variation, it will certainly be with a very slight elevation at first, and with conservative progression over time.
By adding instability to the Push-Up with some of the following variations, trunk stability can be further developed. This isn’t because the athlete needs to “balance” more with these exercises, but rather because they put the athlete in a position that challenges the anti-extension and anti-rotation components trunk stability.
Physio-Ball Push-Up
The Phyio- or Stability-Ball Push-Up challenges both shoulder and trunk stability by providing an unstable surface. For me, it is more about having the athlete continue to focus on performing the Push-Up or High Plank with the utmost focus on posture and movement despite the dynamic environment, and less about “balancing” on the ball.
Renegade Row
When done correctly and strictly, the Renegade Row is one of the hardest version of the Push-Up you can possibly implement. That is because, in order to lift a weight off of the ground from the Push-Up position, the entire body must pick up the slack by creating immense tension. Choose an appropriate weight and you will undoubtedly feel your entire body. Choose an excessive load and you can expect to accomplish very little.
Remember: if we want to improve upper-body pulling strength, we would set up in the strongest, most conducive position possible to do heavy rows. The Renegade Row, though, is not for improving rowing strength; the position itself is inherently weak and unstable, thus we can’t row the same weight on the floor as we can from a traditional rowing position. So, instead, grab the 15 or 20 lbs dumbbells, spread your legs out wide, push your feet into the floor hard, squeeze your glutes, control your breathing, and keep your trunk as still as humanly possible as you perform the Renegade Row.
“The Push-Up Complex” concept deserves an article all to itself. But, briefly, I should emphasize its versatility, variety, and effectiveness.
By my own definition, a Push-Up Complex is any series of movements out of the the High Plank position. The beauty of the Push-Up Complex is that it can allow the coach to program variety (for the purposes of incremental progression, as well as athlete compliance) without having to necessarily add repetitions or load. For example, have an athlete do a set of the following:
Perform each movement in succession, 5 times through
After one set, the athlete will have only done 5 Push-Ups, but they will also have accumulated 5 shoulder taps and 5 leg lifts each side, plus many “touches” with the hands through 5 inchworms. The result is an athlete that not only feels challenged physically, but also is challenged, but in more ways than they may realize; posture, trunk stability,and shoulder stability are all tackled in this complex, as well as hip and t-spine mobility.
Want to address t-spine rotation? Add a High Plank Reach-Through; upward rotation? Add a Downward Dog. Want more of an upper-body challenge? Make it multiple Push-Ups each round, or add a Bear Crawl. When it comes to the Push-Up Complex your imagination is the limiting factor.
Sometimes athletes can’t do the Push-Up due to injury/discomfort. Other times, you may simply want to change it up.
Neutral Grip Push-Up
By using dumbbells or the “Perfect Push-Up” handles (or something equivalent) the athlete’s wrists can be placed into neutral, thus eliminating any wrist discomfort which may be present for whatever reason. Be careful though: the goal of using this modification is to achieve a neutral wrist, not to add range of motion to the bottom of the Push-Up. Do not allow excessive extension of the humerus.
Landmine Press
The Landmine Press, in all of its loading patterns and set-ups (e.g. Half-Kneeling, Banded, Split Stance, etc.), is an excellent Pressing/Reaching exercise for the upper-body. Without going into too much depth, just know that it allows the scapula to move freely just like the Push-Up (and unlike the Bench Press).
***
Between Part I and Part II of this series, we have covered nearly everything you could need to know, as a coach or a player, in order to practically utilize the Push-Up in your training program.
In Part I we discussed the importance of incorporating “Reaching” exercises that allow the scapula to move freely in concert with the humerus, thoracic spine, and rib cage. We also went over a path for initial regression and progression for beginners.
Then, in Part II – this installment – we covered many advanced progressions for the Push-Up, including various loading patterns and methods to destabilize posture and trunk stability for a greater challenge to the entire system.
Ultimately, the goal of this two-part series is to encourage you, the athlete or coach, to appropriately implement the Push-Up, its progressions and regressions, early and often in the yearly training plan.

"Everything Push-Up: why you need it, how to teach it, ways to progress it - Part I - Driveline Baseball",2017-02-23T23:07:09+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/02/everything-push-need-teach-ways-progress-part/,"There are many different ways to select and utilize exercises in order to compose a successful strength-training program. Regardless of which variations you select, the staple movements of most complete programs include the following:
In this series we will discuss an exercise that falls within the Push/Reach category – an exercise that reigns supreme in the world of baseball performance training: the Push-Up.
Today, in Part I of this two-part series we will touch on the significance of the Push-Up, as well as a means to teach it. In Part II we will go over a series of progressions and variations to ensure that you get the most out of the Push-Up during the year-round training plan.
It’s hard to quantify all of the reasons the push-up is such an essential exercise for the baseball player (and all athletes in general). Let’s look at a handful of them (in no particular order):
1.Improving true relative strength
Relative strength is defined as a ratio of strength to bodyweight. Although this can be used to measure an athlete’s strength in nearly any upper-body exercise relative to bodyweight (e.g. a 200 lbs athlete Bench Pressing 315 lbs) what strength is more relative than an athlete’s ability to move their own bodyweight through pulling and pushing? Thus, the Push-Up, Pull-Up, and Inverted Row are three great exercises for determining relative upper-body strength.
2. Postural Awareness
The “High Plank” (a traditional plank, except with elbows fully extended; in other words, holding the top of the Push-Up) is a tremendously simple yet effective exercise for teaching posture. From lumbopelvic control, to scapulothoracic positioning, the High Plank alone does a great job of putting an athlete in a position to learn and control for posture. The Push-Up, then, challenges that acquired awareness and control of posture by adding dynamic movement, and it does so in a way that the Bench Press and its variations simply can not.
3. Trunk Stability
Additionally, the High Plank is an effective exercise for building trunk stability and core strength. Being able to properly align the segments of the body, and subsequently control for this under movement and stress is the essence of trunk stability training. Just lowering one’s bodyweight into the bottom position of the Push-Up poses a challenge to postural integrity. Ascending back to the top can be even more difficult.
4. Scapular Positioning
When done correctly, the Push-Up performed through a full range of motion (more below) not only trains upper-body strength, it also develops strong positioning of the scapula on the thoracic spine and rib cage. For the baseball player, scapulothoracic positioning is vitally important in terms of shoulder health and performance, thus dysfunction in this area should always be addressed. Many of the possible dysfunctions in this region can be remedied by a proper Push-Up and its variations.
5. Freedom of the Scapula
Ultimately, the most significant difference between the Push-Up and other pressing exercises, such as the bench press, is the freedom of the scapula to move, and for actual glenohumeral rhythm to occur. The Closed Kinetic Chain (CKC) nature of the Push-Up allows the scapula to move freely throughout the movement (retraction as the athlete descends, protraction as they ascend). Whereas, with the Bench Press, the scapulae must stay locked down in retraction on the bench for the duration of the movement in order to ensure shoulder safety, and to minimize the amount of total work necessary to complete the lift.
Throwing a baseball requires the glenohumeral joint (in conjunction with all surrounding joints in the Kinetic Chain) move optimally and freely. The Push-Up not only matches this movement demand, but it also encourages the development of safe and strong shoulder function.
When teaching the Push-Up, the coach should avoid taking out the trunk stability components simply to make it easier. For example, we should not put our athletes on their knees to make the exercise easier on the upper-body. It is vital to progress and regress the entire movement as a whole system, rather than focusing only on upper-body strength. This is because enhancing upper-body strength alone will not concurrently develop trunk stability, postural awareness, etc.
Thus, we should select teaching regressions and progressions that not only adequately challenge the strength of the athlete, but also appropriately develop postural awareness, and bring along trunk stability as well. Additionally, appropriate regressions/progressions place the athlete in the best environment to learn new movements.
There are a couple of “check-points” that must be observed in each phase of the progression before moving on to the next variation. Personally, I like to see the following:
The athlete first must be able to attain this positioning in a static position before movement can be added, and then the athlete should maintain all of these “checkpoints” despite movement and fatigue. The Push-Up will not be progressed until these checkpoints are met and maintained under increasing stress and fatigue.
Above all else, these two themes are most emphasized early in the program:
In order to do this, we always start with the High Plank as our base regression for the Push-Up (as well as for Trunk Stability programs).
The most effective cues I have found have been the following:
“No soft shoulders. Push the floor away” for scapular protraction, and
“Belly button to spine” for lumbar positioning
Also, I will place them in a position to meet these two cues by starting them in a Quadruped position, and then taking them into the High Plank.
Upon showing proficiency in maintaining the proper High Plank for roughly 30 seconds, we then progress to Eccentric-Only Push-Ups on the floor, and Concentric Push-Ups from a regressed, hands-elevated position.
Eccentric-Only Push-Up
Once the athlete has shown proficiency in the static High Plank position, we begin to challenge it by adding dynamic movement. Most novice trainees experience the greatest difficulty maintaining posture during the ascension from the bottom back to the top of the Push-Up, thus we use the Eccentric-Only Push-Up to develop upper-body strength and incrementally challenge posture and stability without overloading it to a breaking point.
Additionally, because the athlete does not perform the concentric phase during the Eccentric-Only Push-Up, they must reset to their High Plank every single rep. Thus, 3×5 of the Eccentric-Only Push-Up forces the athlete to properly position and align themselves fifteen times, without having to explicitly dedicate time to working on the High Plank.
Generally, we will emphasize a 3s eccentric and a 3s isometric on each rep.
Concentric Push-Up from Hands-Elevated Position
Initially the Eccentric Push-Up is used individually and alone. But, as this becomes easier (which happens quickly as the athlete sees progress rapidly in the initial stages of training) we begin to pair it with full push-ups (Eccentric and Concentric) where the hands are elevated to the appropriate height. By elevating the hands, the upper-body strength required to complete the lift is lessened. But, unlike the push-up from knees, the hands-elevated position still challenges posture and stability, thus maintaining the bang-for-the-buck of the true Push-Up despite being regressed.
In general, this pairing of exercises may look something like:
1a. Eccentric-Only Push-Up from floor (3s eccentric + 3s isometric at bottom) – 3 x 5
1b. Concentric Push-Up from hands-elevated position (1s eccentric + 1s isometric + 1s concentric) – 3 x 8
Once the athlete shows an ability to proficiently stabilize the trunk and control posture thought the movement, while also exhibiting the strength to complete the desired repetitions, we can begin to progressively remove the Eccentric Push-Up volume, while simultaneously lowering the height at which our hands are elevated.
After a few weeks/months, most athletes (with reasonable body weight/composition and strength) tend to progress to the floor and use traditional Push-Ups.
In Part II of this series we will discuss ways in which to add variety and progression to the traditional Push-Up to ensure that it can be effectively used year-round with athletes of varying training capabilities.

"The Meaning of ""Sport-Specific"" in Baseball Training - Driveline Baseball",2017-02-21T02:46:41+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/02/meaning-sport-specific-baseball-training/,"Go to just about any baseball field in the country and you are bound to hear the term “Sport Specific” a handful of times in reference to strength training. Whether it be players, coaches, or parents, they all want the same thing: performance training that adequately matches the demands of the game of baseball.
This rings true at every level, and not at the exclusion of the high school. I can personally attest to this: I don’t believe I have experienced many conversations on the topic of training with a player, coach, or parent at the high school level where the phrase, “baseball specific” wasn’t thrown out at least once, if not multiple times.
Certainly, this is for completely understandable reasons. Every player deserves the best training available to them, and this includes training that matches the demands of their sport. But, great training takes into consideration more than just the sport in which the athlete competes. We must also consider the individual as well; their biological and training ages, their capabilities and limitations.
What most parents, ball coaches, and players are seeking, as they often will directly reference, is methods that most likely lay beyond their current abilities or necessities as a novice athlete; they mostly speak of the highly specific and specialized movements that they seen on the internet.
But, this doesn’t mean that “sport specific” isn’t an appropriate goal at this level. It is simply used in the wrong context: the novice trainee – i.e. the majority of all high school baseball players – needs predominantly general strength-training.
The sport specific context that we should be after at this level is the one which accommodates training to avoid contraindications for the overhead throwing athlete. In more simple terms, we are looking for training protocols and exercises that do not put the baseball player at risk of getting hurt, or at risk for accentuating any chronic pathologies – both symptomatic and asymptomatic.
This leads me to two goals that sit at the core of my high school baseball program design:
Let’s take a closer look at each goal
This specific topic has been discussed at length in its own right on this blog as well as my own blog, so we won’t spend too long reiterating the points here. But, a couple things should be noted:
As stated above, most high school level athletes simply need generalized strength-training. This isn’t necessarily because they can’t handle any more than this – although this is the case for many – but more so because, to do anything hyper-specialized would be a gross misuse of time, at least initially.
In reality, almost anything can work to get a novice athlete stronger. Of course, we don’t want to give them just anything, but we also don’t wan’t to risk injury, nor do we want to inefficiently use our time selecting exercises and methods that just aren’t necessary, and may be above our athletes capabilities.
General strength-training exercises that are complex (meaning they use multiple muscle groups and joints) using free-weights (e.g. the loaded barbell) should be incorporated early and often in the novice’s program. You certainly can never go wrong with Squat, Deadlift, Rowing, and Reaching/Pressing variations. These exercises will challenge and stress many muscle groups at once, and thus will need massive neuromuscular recruitment and force production. Adaptions can be seen relatively quickly for both in this way, especially in terms of the nervous system. Don’t be surprised to see your new trainees adding strength exponentially while gaining very little body weight initially.
As the athlete progresses, grows, develops, and gains experience in training, more advanced protocols can more safely be used. Specialized movements will not only become more appropriate, but also more necessary to see positive development.
So, in what context can we actually implement baseball specific training so that our athletes get the best training that we can possibly provide them?
What we can provide, in terms of sport-specific training at the high school level, is exercise selection and programming that avoids placing stress onto areas that don’t need additional stress. We are looking to avoid contraindications; exercises that should not be used due to either limitations of the individual or tendencies/trends seen in a specific population.
For our particular population – the overhead throwing athlete – this means accommodating exercises for the baseball player to avoid shoulder, elbow, hand, hip, and back pathologies. Ballplayers create and transfer significant forces across many segments in the body, resulting in adaptations both good (for performance) and bad (for health). Some of these adaptations can present pathological symptoms. Others may not present any symptoms despite still posing an underlying risk.
Thus, exercises that place unnecessary stress on these segments, in addition to that in which they experience in competition, have no place in the program – at least, not in their contraindicatory state.
For example, the squat. The Back Squat is a great exercise for developing lower body strength and power. In fact, it is one of the kings of the metaphorical training jungle. That being said, it happens to place the athlete’s shoulder in an externally rotated state, while also allowing very little ability to control what is happening at that joint. The low-bar Back Squat accentuates the position. One slip of the bar, especially with a heavy load, or too much exposure to the position could risk irritating even a seemingly healthy shoulder.
This is not to say that we should remove the Squat. Accommodation is the key word, and we can accommodate the needs of the baseball player and their shoulder by utilizing the other squatting variations. Specifically, the Squat with a Safety Bar (if you’re so lucky to have one) or the Front Squat would allow for nearly equal loading capabilities, without the external rotation torque at the shoulder. Even the Front Squat itself could be accommodated with straps to remove any discomfort caused by the front rack position,
Also consider the overhead press (e.g. the Military Press, Barbell Press, etc.). This thought is more widely accepted: opting out of the overhead press. For me, personally, it isn’t just about the weight directly. It is more about the indirect influencers on the movement further down the chain, i.e. the shoulders and lower back/trunk. Most young athletes do not possess the requisite mobility of the shoulder (or they may actually possess pathology at the shoulder) or proper trunk stability to execute the movement correctly or safely.
Thus, we opt to accommodate the movement: we still work overhead, but with lighter loads (less likely to amplify symptoms) and with exercises that put the athlete in a position to successfully complete the lift. For example, there are Wall Slide variations, which require that the athlete work through the overhead range of motion, yet can more easily control for lumbo-pelvic positioning. We could also use a Kneeling or Standing Landmine Press, which does the same, and also restricts full shoulder flexion.
Now, is this to say that I have never and will never Back Squat a baseball player? Does it mean that I have stopped every baseball player from pressing overhead? No, not necessarily. But, if there are more appropriate and effective methods/means at my disposal, I will generally opt to use those.
Again, the goal is not to disbar any exercises or movement; rather we are seeking to accommodate exercises to enable and foster safe and effective movement that meets the demands of the athlete and their sport.
***
If anything is gleaned from this discussion, I hope it is that “sport specific” training is context-dependent; it means many different things depending on the caliber and experience of the athlete. When planning the training program for high school ballplayers, we should certainly view the program through a sport-specific lens – the lens of age-appropriate and non-contraindicatory exercises and protocols. As the athlete progresses and develops, they can then start to paint their exercises in a sport specific hue that reflects better transfer to training.

Great article. What is your opinion of full power cleans for overhead throwing athletes. That is a key exercise in our high schools performance PE class. As a parent I worry about my sons elbow in this lift. I have asked a friend of mine whom is the baseball strength coach at a local college and he only has his players bring the lift to their thighs and then drop the bar. Love to hear your thoughts.
Todd, thanks for the post! Short answer, the power clean can be done if you are a baseball player. The power clean has to be done correctly, which is difficult given that it is a complex, full-body Olympic lift. That is why we say it can be done, but it is not recommended. Even athletes who perform proper power cleans can make a mistake occasionally and stress the elbow. Instead of power cleans, we do high pulls. They do not stress the elbow because there is no catch portion of the lift.
Good stuff, kind of going along with the previous comment… what are your thoughts on these lifts such as the Power Jerk and Snatch as well.? And does bench pressing affect throwing velocity (negatively or positively.) For our Physical Fitness lifting class at school, we have a Level 3 National Level Coach for USA Weightlifting (USAW) as our weightlifting coach and is awesome, and we do tons of great all-around exercises from body-weight to Olympic lifts. Everybody gets stronger and quicker with an extremely minuscule amount of injuries, but he treats the baseball players like any other sport (like football for instance). Do lifts like the snatch and jerk strengthen your shoulders in a way in which you can increase in velocity eventually?  I just wanted to know your thoughts
There have been studies linking bench press to velocity in handball but none that I know of for baseball at this point.
As for snatch & jerk, if they are being taught technically correct it should be ok. We prefer landmine pressing to straight overhead and we tend to stay away from snatching, but having strong shoulders is obviously important.

Building Your Team's In-Season Training Plan - Part III - Driveline Baseball,2017-01-30T15:57:40+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/01/developing-season-training-routine-part-iii/,"In the first piece of this three-part series we discussed the overall importance of in-season training for the high school baseball player, and how it fits, philosophically, within the context of the spring baseball season.
Part two covered the considerations that should be taken when planning out the in-season training program – laying out the game and practice schedule, having multiple training modes prepared, and maintaining flexibility in your programming.
In this discussion, our final installment, we will look at how to structure in-season training sessions in order to get the most bang for your buck, while also minimizing the amount of time spent in the weight room.
Time spent in the weight room should be centered on two things:
1. The aspects of training that are most important to sport performance and that cannot go an entire season without being addressed
2. Aspects and modes of training that cannot be addressed on the field
With these two stipulations in mind, we can “trim the fat” of each training session in order to focus on the bulk of the meat.
Some non-negotiable’s of in-season training include total-body strength, power, and mobility. An entire in-season period of several months without these qualities being addressed would lead to decrements in strength that would ultimately see a reduction in power. It would also allow the insidious progression of musculoskeletal adaptations in response to throwing, such as augmented ranges of motion at the shoulder and hip.
Neither one of the above scenarios is ideal for a baseball player of anyone level. And, given the relatively less demanding schedule of high school baseball compared to higher levels of the sport, there is no reason strength, power, and mobility shouldn’t be addressed.
Trunk stability and “arm care” too are vital, especially in order to off-set all of the game and practice loads that the players experience in terms of rotational movement (i.e. throwing, swinging).
With these five “non-negotiable’s” in mind, let’s discuss some ways to maximize the exposure of our athletes to these qualities of training, while minimizing the amount of time and energy taken away from games and practices.
Of the above non-negotiable’s, quite a few of them can be trained outside of the weight room. While strength, and oftentimes power need heavy loads of select equipment to best drive their adaptations, performance qualities such as tissue quality, joint mobility, and trunk stability need little by the way of equipment, space, or even time. Thus, there is a great potential to address these aspects of training on the field before, during, or after practice. And, because of this, not only does that eliminate the need for additional time-costly training sessions in the weight room, it also means that they can be addressed often, if not every single day.
For tissue quality and joint mobility, the greater the exposure, the more likely we are to see substantial changes, rather than transient ones. Thus, working soft-tissue modalities (such as foam rolling with a roller or baseball), or addressing mobility can be used daily in smaller, yet highly effective doses.
One of the easiest ways to work in mobility and tissue quality is to include them in the warm-up, as the warm-up is conveniently used every day. Rather than glazing over during a monotonous warm-up, treat it as a prep session that addresses the needs of the individual, or the overall needs of the team.
As for stability and “arm care”, these can be included in the warm-up as well, or around the various practice session stations. In fact, they can be a station all to themselves; they need not but 5 minutes or less if their is a focused plan and attitude. Regardless of how you integrate these aspects, their frequent inclusion will help the athlete become more cognizant of posture, while also helping to cement stability through strength.
This is not to say that any of these qualities can’t or shouldn’t be addressed in the training session as well, but the most prudent suggestion would be doing so only in order to emphasize what you feel needs additional focus, not just for the sake of including more work (and using more time).
When developing the training sessions themselves, you should always keep in focus the goal of the session. Remember, we are training for performance – we are not exercising.
For example, if we are looking to maintain or gain strength, we should not be programming sets of 12 reps on the Squat. Rather, high intensity sets of 2-6 reps could be used to stimulate the muscles to produce great amounts of force to overcome the load. Likewise, with the goal of maintaining or gaining strength in mind, we should not rush our players to perform sets in 60-90 second intervals just for the sake of time or “hard work.” In order to produce maximal force from set to set, we must allow for adequate recovery times in between sets.
Power, too, should be similarly focused. Power production capabilities will taper off as muscular and neurological fatigue accumulates. Thus, high rep sets of box jumps, cleans, med ball work, etc. will eventually lead to sloppy, unfocused, and non-maximal effort work. Again, rest is vital as well.
Hopefully you are starting to realize a major theme to in-season training: volume is not the priority. Thus, we should focus our time and energy on what is most appropriate: strength, power, and any recovery that is necessary.
One way to ensure that the focus is always simple to understand and implement is to divide the training sessions, each with one narrow focus.
While we could spend a little time of power, and a little time of strength, and a little time of pre-hab, etc. each session and get away with it (young trainees get good results with “mixed training” as this would be called), it could be hard to explain at times, and tough to ensure that the focus remains intact during the in-season. It can also make flexible/adaptable training schedules harder.
Instead, you could spend one thirty-minute session on strength each week, one thirty-minute session on power/speed, and one session on recovery/mobility if a third day is allowed given the time constraints.
Moreover, a week can see any given combination of these sessions. If the team seems to be fatigued, a recovery/mobility session may be a better choice that day than say, a power session. Regardless of which sessions are selected each week, the focus of each session will remain constant to that day’s theme: if it is a power day, the athletes know they must move the weight fast, and if it is a strength day, they know they must exert some serious force.
It should be noted that there are many effective ways to structure a training session. Regardless of how you choose to do so, you should be mindful to keep the training goals in focus at all times, and also strive to minimize the time necessary to accomplish those training goals.
It may seem obvious to many, but the easiest way to maximize time efficiency is to actually eliminate training sessions. This means refraining from training splits that require more training sessions than necessary. By moving away from two upper-body and two lower-body sessions per week in order to use two to three total-body training sessions, we can eliminate hours of work and get the same goals accomplished.
Additionally, time can be best used within the session itself by utilizing active rest, whereby a rest period for the lower-body is occupied by an upper-body exercise or some other non-lower-body taxing exercise.
In our lifts, we may select an emphasis for the day, such as the Squat. This exercise will only have a trunk stability or a mobility exercise paired with it. In that way we are using our rest periods judiciously, yet not overtaxing the body – even an upper-body exercise during a rest period can make the Squat feel that much harder. Additionally, we may have mismatched sets for that emphasis. In other words, we may have 5 sets of Squats, but only 3 sets of a trunk stability exercise. The purpose of these mismatched sets is to ensure that the most physically demanding sets have zero interference from any other exercises during rest.
Beyond our “emphasis”, we might pair upper-body and lower-body exercises the rest of the way. For example:
Again, the overall idea is to maintain focus on very specific training goals during our sessions, while also minimizing the time needed during training to foster these adaptations.

When it comes to in-season performance training, a handful of very important themes must be held onto closely:
If the coach keeps these key concepts in mind, in-season training is sure to become a successful component of the competitive season at the high school level.

Building Your Team's In-Season Training Plan - Part II - Driveline Baseball,2017-01-24T02:17:32+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/01/building-teams-season-training-plan-part-ii/,"In part one of this three-part series we discussed some initial considerations to account for when developing an in-season training program for the high school baseball team.
In summary, Part I established the overall purpose of strength-training and performance training in-season, and the importance of keeping it within the context of the game and practice schedule. We also discussed the topic of mitigating injury risk when prescribing exercises and the overall training plan.
Today, in Part II, we will talk discuss a way to simplify the planning process for the training program within the confines of the game and practice schedule.
The first step is to lay out the competitive schedule, and define each phase of the season – Pre-Season, In-Season, and Championship Season – determine the importance of each phase in terms of training and winning, and then understanding the role of flexibility in planning.
For the purposes of this blog post I will utilize the DeLand High School Baseball schedule as an example.
First, I suggest labeling each phase of the season:
Our student’s first full week of school after winter break begins on January 9th, but we do not begin training until the following week (1/16). This allows for two full weeks of training prior to our official tryouts. Games, though do not begin until February 14th, thus we have two additional weeks for training leading up to the first competitions. Let’s call this the pre-season phase.
The pre-season phase should is characterized by training that blends the gains made in the off-season with the training that they will need for the regular season. This also serves as an additional four weeks of training in which the weight room and physical preparation can be the main focus (before it officially shifts into the background in favor of a focus on competing).
Once the games begin, that is when more careful consideration must be made when scheduling training sessions.
The competitive season should be centered around on-field performance. This means that strength-training, conditioning, etc. should take a back seat to actual baseball.
A “back seat” doesn’t mean that they are no longer important. But, it does mean that the game-schedule, which is the ultimate priority, should be laid out, with practice and training built around it. Not every game or game-week carries equal significance, thus laying out the game and practice schedule also allows the focus to shift to and from performance training.
For example, between February 14th and the end of the month, our DHS squad will only oppose one “District” opponent. District games are the only competitions during the regular season in which the outcome truly has an impact – a team’s record after all District play has concluded dictates their seeding in the first phase of the post-season (aka “Championship Season”).
During these first two weeks of play, the outcomes of the games matter much less than the overall development that is seen, including the progress that occurs in the weight room. Also, the athletes are more fresh; less mentally and physically fatigued from the their playing and school workloads.
In comparison, some weeks later in the season carry much more weight. For example, the final week of March and the first week of April both contain two District games a piece (against what we presume will be
highly competitive teams). Additionally, these weeks occur later in the season, when accumulated fatigue may become a much more prevalent factor. This is in stark contrast to the previous week exemplified above.
When comparing these two scenarios, we can see that laying out the game schedule and determining the importance of each week can help shift the priority from one focus – on-field performance and weight room performance – to another.
Unfortunately, to say that planning your training sessions for an entire season is as easy to do as picking out your tough or meaningful weeks, and then training less in response (or your less significant weeks and training more).
You also must consider many other factors. For instance:
How important is practice time on the field, in the cage, etc. at any point during the season? Early on we could say that practice time might be most beneficial, as the team has just been assembled and the fundamentals and strategies must be drilled into the players.
What about later in the season when, possibly, a new defensive concept needs to be installed, or after the JV season when select players are called up to the Varsity squad?
What happens when practices are rained out on consecutive days, or when school functions inhibit practice plans?
How about when the players show signs of fatigue?
The point of asking these questions isn’t to suggest that you should find and prepare an answer for each, and then create a plan for every scenario before they occur. The goal is to prove the following point: in-season training plans should be written in pencil, not pen.
Plan as much as you’d like, but ultimately there are too many variables for the high school coach to control for all at once.
That’s why I suggest the following steps be taken to ensure that the training frequency and schedule best meet the needs of team in-season:
With all of this in mind, you are prepared to plan out your in-season training program, and also have mechanisms in place to enable flexibility and adaptability in the program. In this way, the specific needs of the team and the athlete can be addressed at any one point in time during the season.
In our third installment we will discuss the more minute X’s and O’s of the training program in-season, including those pertaining to volume, intensity, frequency, etc.

Building Your Team's In-Season Training Plan - Part I - Driveline Baseball,2017-01-14T07:46:40+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/01/building-teams-season-training-plan-part/,"The competitive high school baseball season is nearly upon us. As 2017 has finally arrived, many southern states are merely a handful of weeks away from tryouts, leaving very little time left for planning. Even the northern states who observe a true winter will see their first pitches thrown sooner rather than later.
With whatever time your school has remaining prior to baseball season, it is vital that the high school baseball coach thoughtfully plan out not just their practice plan, but also their training plan, should they want to incorporate strength-training into the competition season.
The goal of this three-part season is as follows:
Part I: to discuss general considerations for in-season training that must be accounted for prior to putting pen to paper
Part II: to establish a simple plan for overlaying the competitive and practice schedule, and then building a flexible training schedule around this
Part III: to create a simple, yet effective program for in-season training
Today we will discuss some preliminary concepts, such as the overall purpose of in-season training, the fit of strength-training alongside all of the competing demands of the season, and the ways to mitigate risk in-season.
The first step in integrating a strength-training program into the competition season at the high school level it to understand its purpose in the entire scheme of the season.
The value of strength-training at the amateur level cannot be understated: novice athletes can benefit more in nearly every aspect of their game simply by getting stronger through quality movement. Their nervous systems’ are ripe and ready for the stress of progressive resistance training, and for this reason will adapt very quickly.
These days, amateur baseball is a year-round endeavor, transforming the four traditional calendar “seasons” into just three. The high school athlete will compete in the spring, and will travel to compete in the summer and fall. While “Winter” may be a real season in the south, youth baseball simply does not recognize it, and the competitive fall and spring seasons nearly overlap. Thus, to take any part of the year entirely off from strength-training in order to focus on competition is essentially committing to foregoing a vast opportunity for development.
But, this is not to say that strength-training should carry an equally high emphasis year-round. We can place an emphasis on competition at various points of the year; accumulating, peaking, and tapering our training as needed to accommodate our games.
Call me old fashioned, but if I had to assign a true competitive season during the year, I still believe the spring high school baseball season is that. They compete as a team for a common goal, just as they will at nearly every level of baseball.
Thus, during the spring season, we want to maintain our strength-training, yes, but we must also remember that it is not the ultimate priority; performance on the field is.
The number one priority in-season when it comes to performance training is ensuring that the athlete is actually available to perform on the field. You can forget about “optimizing performance” if you are not able to perform at all thanks to injury.
Strength-training in-season can and should accomplish two objectives in terms of readiness to play:
1. It should help reduce the likelihood of injury on the field
 2. It should not place the athlete in a position to get hurt during training
Thus, risk management is a major consideration to account for when designing an in-season training program. Let’s start with the latter and work our way back:
If the reduction of injury on the field is the ultimate goal of performance training, then anything that increases the risk of sustaining an injury during performance training, itself, would be the ultimate absurdity.
Therefore, exercise selection, thorough coaching, and appropriate intensities/volumes should be at the forefront of the planning and coaching process.
It is highly recommended that your athletes train within their means – the means that they’ve established during the off-season. For example, if your team has implemented Back Squats for lower-body strength and various jumps for lower-body power during the off-season, the idea of introducing Front Squats and Cleans for the first time in-season imposes a great risk with relatively less reward in the grand scheme of things – despite the article you may have read about the benefits of Front Squats, or the videos you’ve seen of a College World Series program using Cleans in-season.
No matter how beneficial some exercises may be (in the example above, the Front Squat and Clean are actually highly beneficial) the introduction of drastically novel exercises can, for one, lead to excessive soreness (which can hinder performance if not kept in check), and moreover can reduce the likelihood of injury in the weight room if the athlete is not ready for the exercise, or is not coached up appropriately. Essentially, there are just too many ways for it to go wrong, even in a perfect world, let alone with the constraints on strength-training posed by nor possessing a full-time strength and conditioning professional at the high school level.
We must also remember that the overall goal of performance training in-season is to continue the development process, even if it is on a less steep trajectory than the off-season. The relative shallowness of the developmental slope in-season is a result of the competing demands of the in-season stressors: there is strength training, competition, practice, extra sessions, conditioning, school, girl friends, family issues, etc…
Thus, we must understand that training, as it stands at a lower priority than competition, must be most flexible. Some days the players will have the “juice” to train very intensely. Some days they just won’t have it at all. Educating your athletes on the benefits of training in-season and how it fits into the overall gameplay is a must. But, holding them to a rigid training program when they are clearly spent from a tough week of games may actually predispose them to performance decrements on the field, or worse: injury as a result of muscular and/or neural fatigue.
Training then, must be integrated into the entire practice plan and competition schedule, not just thrown on top of it.
In Part II of this 3-part series we will discuss just how to go about laying out the in-season program by overlaying the competition schedule and practice plan, while also finding ways to be most flexible during the integration of all three.

The Path to Long-Term Training Progress and Adaptation - Driveline Baseball,2016-12-14T03:59:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/12/path-long-term-training-progress-adaptation/,"In the previous post we discussed the importance of a ballplayer’s first year of strength-training, and how to go about making the most of that first year.
Today we will extend from that topic by discussing further the great window of adaptation that novice athletes possess, and why it is important to slow-cook their development, rather than attempt to move too quickly through the training process.
Despite what many fanatical parents, misinformed coaches, and highly ambitious players may think, it is not okay to train a novice or youth athlete like a professional.
We often hear something to the effect of, “My son is a big strong kid, and an elite-level player. He’s ready for professional training.” But, no measure of on-field success or physical characteristics at the youth or high school level can warrant professional-intensive strength training.
Of course, there is the psychological side of the argument: kids should avoid specializing in one sport and training too intensively for that one sport due to an increased likelihood of burnout.
We could also discuss at length the relationship between early sport specialization and injury: overexposure to one sport too soon can actually hinder a kid’s chances of becoming a successful, pain/injury-free athlete.
Those two arguments, alone, are strong. But, we will be taking it a step further today and looking at it from the performance training standpoint: what is best for training the athlete, long-term? The simple answer is age-appropriate training.
Let’s take a different approach to labeling and characterizing these athletes. We all understand what separates an amateur athlete from a professional. Of course there is age, but moreover there is the actual necessity of baseball in their life; the amateur is playing for enjoyment of the game, whereas a professional is playing for the livelihood of themselves and/or their family, and it is all riding on their performance.
But, when we reference the “professional athlete”, we are also synonymously talking about the intermediate or advanced trainee. In other words, the athlete that has accumulated more than a year or so of committed and serious strength-training.
Meanwhile, the “amateur athlete” alludes to a the novice trainee who has very limited training experience (and, no, chest/tris and back/bis days at the YMCA does not count toward your training age – we are talking about committed strength-training).
Why this categorization (novice vs. intermediate, advanced) is important is because it establishes the relative adaptability of the ballplayer in terms of strength-training. When it comes to training age, the younger athlete has a greater propensity for adaptation to the stressors of training.
In brief, strength-training places specific stressors on the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system. Manipulating the variables of intensity (load), volume, rest, etc. can help elicit the specific adaptations that we are seeking, such as increases in muscle mass, increases in strength, or an increased ability to display power. In order to achieve a positive adaptation, the body must be exposed to a stressor that is strong enough to disrupt homeostasis. In other words, the loading, volume, or whatever stress we are applying must be significant enough to tax our body beyond what it is used to experiencing.
Since novice trainees have little to no training experience, it doesn’t take much stress to achieve this disruption of homeostasis. Once technique has been established and the body is taxed with a significant load and volume, the body will reach an “alarm” stage. Essentially, fatigue has accumulated, performance decreases, and oftentimes soreness onsets.
Then in the coming days the body will recover, and then ultimately supercompensate – the term used for an improvement in strength (or any other performance characteristic) above baseline in response to the work we put in during training.
An example: a novice athlete squats 100 lbs. for 3 sets of 5 today, putting his body in the alarm stage. In the coming days, he will recover. Later in the week, if the athlete attempts to squat for 3 sets of 5 again, he should hopefully have supercompensated and be able to use a weight greater than 100 lbs.
Every athlete and trainee can and will go through this cycle of stress and adaptation, no matter their biological or training age. But, those with a younger training age, such as the novice athlete, have more room to grow, develop, and progress each time. What’s more, they are able to do it at a faster rate, as they have rarely pushed beyond their low-level baseline, or homeostasis.
As the athlete progresses, though, gains come with a heftier price tag – more work and stress. The body will need to be placed under increasing loads, with more variability in their training methods, and with even more time set aside for recovery. Supercompensation can still occur, it just takes longer, and yields increasingly more marginal results.
Everyone has their own theoretical physical potential limit that they are attempting to reach, and as we get more near that finite line, the harder it actually becomes to get there. We can’t simply use the same set and rep scheme and steady loading increases from session to session or week to week forever. It is the law of diminishing returns.
A few years into training, and a simple stressor of 3 x 5 squats week in and week out will not elicit the disruption of homeostasis that will lead to the attainment of increased strength.
Hence why we see the older trainee using bands, chains, clusters, double-sessions, advanced programming, and/or progressive exercise variations in all of the Youtube videos of collegiate and professional weight training sessions. These athletes have been training for years, thus their return on training investment is dwindling with traditional beginner methods.
Unfortunately, these videos, which should serve as motivation for young athletes, can often turn to a model for emulation for these same athletes, their coaches, and worse their parents. They all want the same thing; they want little Johnny to compete at the collegiate/professional level one day, so they think that training like those professionals/collegians is the way to get there, when it is quite the contrary.
As we discussed in a the post, the novice athlete will adapt to just about any training program so long as it stresses the system beyond homeostasis.
While every kid wants to load up the barbell with right off the jump and perform every sexy and cool variation in training, the novice trainee (or the coach that trains these athletes, or the parents who raise these kids) should hold advanced training methods in their back pocket like an ace up their sleeve – saving them instead for when the returns on training investment begin to diminish in the coming years.
If we use these advanced methods now, what will we do when the slope of our progress begins to flatten out?
Ideally, the introduction phase that an athlete experiences in the weight room should be used to develop comfortability and proficiency in the major basic movements – i.e. the squat, hinge, lunge, push and pull. Even with body weight and minimal loading, the athlete will be forcing the body to adapt and grow. After a short time, loaded barbell/dumbbell movements can be used conservatively to drive more growth and adaptation.
Meanwhile, as time goes on and the athlete adapts to progressively heavier and more stressful training, the athlete and coach can take the time to properly learn the more advanced methods (those that are age-appropriate for intermediates) and then apply them when the time is actually right.
In this way, not only does athletic development and adaptation become a long-term process, but so too does learning. Together, they will then help the athlete/coach/parent see progression consistently over time, with little to no injury.

The Most Important Year of Your Training Career - Driveline Baseball,2016-12-06T07:53:22+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/12/important-year-training-career/,"While every year, off-season, month, and week of training is vitally important to the development of the athlete, not all years are created equal. In fact, many might say that the training cycles that carry the most weight and significance are those that occur later in a career, when a player has achieved elite or professional status, and their job is on the line.
Of course those years are important, but one could argue that the inaugural year of training in the primitive stages of a career (i.e. high school) can carry just as much meaning, if not more than any other training period in a player’s career.
If you possess any knowledge on the topic of performance training, you might already know that just about any kind of resistance training can elicit a positive strength training adaptation in a novice trainee. It is true, getting stronger in the formative stages of strength-training isn’t the most difficult. So, why would we deem this the most important time period in your training career? Let’s discuss…
There is no silver bullet for performance enhancing training, especially when it comes to the novice trainee. In fact, you could say that even a shotgun spray method in the dark could work just fine in the pursuit of gaining strength and size for a young trainee. I am not saying this is optimal (the goal of this discussion is to make a case for the opposite) but it is a plausible method.
That is because just about anything can work – even faulty, unfocused, and/or misguided training methods – when the body has yet to be exposed to the stressors of external loading and resistance. That is why you could put a first-year trainee (like a high school athlete) on P90x, CrossFit, or anything in between, and he/she will still get stronger.
In the primitive stages of training, the athlete’s body is ripe for the picking in terms of neurological adaptations. As soon as the body experiences significant external loading that perturbs homeostasis for the first time, it is quick to adapt. The nervous system begins to make more connections to the muscles, and those connections in turn become more effective, firing at a faster and more appropriately synchronized rate.
If an athlete could bodyweight squat their way to improved neurological efficiency; if they could haphazardly progress to advanced exercises and perform them without technical proficiency, yet still get stronger; if we could skip the “get the athletes to buy in” part, and give them the sexy exercises they want whether they are ready for them or not; if we can do all of this and still make gains in the weight room during that first year, why go through the trouble of doing it the “right” way?
Let’s discuss two of the many, many reasons why:
Above all else we must consider safety and the risk of injury. Our number one goal and mission as strength and conditioning coaches (and even as sport coaches) is to reduce the likelihood of injury. Personally, I see this as a two-pronged approach:
Through appropriately sequenced, progressed, and scripted training, we can help the athlete avoid injury on the field. Failure to do so not only increases the likelihood of injury, it can actually encourages it. Loading the body in a non-progressive or overly aggressive manner – especially on top of faulty movement patterns – can cause fatigue to inappropriately accumulate, leading to increased risk of injury on the field. It can also damage or weaken the system as a whole, again increasing the risk of injury during competition.
What’s more, if a coach fails to take control of the development process in the weight room and allows his/her athletes to do whatever they want without proper progressions/regressions, they are opening the door to injury in training. Not only is injury in training bad, it is illogical and nonsensical; our goal in training is to reduce the likelihood of injury during competition, so we surely must not allow them to occur during training itself.
While “anything” can get an athlete stronger as a novice, not everything can accomplish the prioritized goal of every performance training program: to reduce the likelihood of injury. In fact, improper training can actually enhance the likelihood of injury during competition and training.
If nearly “anything” can work to enhance a novice trainees strength, then spending our time only gaining strength would be a very inefficient use of training time.
There is more to performance training than just strength or “lifting”. For instance, there is movement quality found in the ability to perform a variety of movements safely and efficiently. There is postural awareness and alignment, joint mobility, and trunk stability, among other aspects.
Simply because we can, in theory, get stronger without much thought during our first year of training doesn’t mean we can improve any of the above aspects as easily. In fact, without focusing on say, movement quality, movement can actually get worse.
While many high school weight rooms (or commercial gyms, or private facilities) around the country see athletes allowed to perform abhorrent movement patterns under significant load for the sake of getting stronger, you, the thoughtful and passionate coach/athlete can be different: you can make the most out of your training by putting some thought and diligent effort into developing more than just strength.
For example, by beginning with a bodyweight squat and appropriately progressing up the ladder to more advanced squatting exercises, the athlete can not only get stronger, but they can actually learn how to squat – and not just squat, but squat safely and with the utmost effectiveness. This will have major carryover to sport as well, as the athlete is not only getting stronger, but also learning how to control their limbs in space, and to do so under progressively challenging circumstances (whether that be varied loads, tempos, etc).
Another example would be upper body pushing strength. Many coaches write “Bench Press” into the program on day one, oftentimes without even teaching how to bench press. While their Bench Press numbers no doubt go up and signify increased strength, their reliance on momentum from the chest-caving bounce the bar might be making on the sternum will too probably increase, while their ability to utilize full-body tension or to stabilize the shoulder girdle during the press will probably remain nonexistent.
Teaching a proper push-up first, though, could not only improve strength of the upper body, it can also improve trunk stability while also drawing attention to postural awareness and the scapula’s role in shoulder movement.
Shifting the training approach from strength without regards to dysfunction, to a more focused approach on performance enhancement and injury reduction can not only enhance training, it can make the first year of training one of the most important of an athlete’s career, as it has the potential to carry some serious bang-for-the-buck.
***
While there are an abundance of reasons to take a logical, methodical, and progressive approach to training the novice athlete, one overarching piece of rationale presides above the rest: it is one of the most influential periods of time for an athlete during their training, and thus is arguably the most important.
For this reason, we must not be willing to accept just any type training methods (or a lack of true methods) just because we can easily progress the strength of a novice athlete. On the contrary, the fact that strength increases easily is all the more reason to take advantage of this great window of adaptation by developing more qualities than just strength (such as movement quality) all the while working diligently to reduce the likelihood of injury on the field and in training.

“Core Training” – What It Is and How to Progress It – Part III - Driveline Baseball,2016-11-30T07:01:22+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/core-training-progress-part-iii/,"The previous two parts of this series discussed both the intro and intermediate phases of my own progressions for core/trunk training.
Part I specifically discussed what it actually means to train the “core” – or as we are calling it instead, the trunk – and how to build the foundation for more advanced training in subsequent phases. As you may recall, the goals of the first phase hinged on building strength and stability of the trunk through postural awareness and many static trunk stability exercises. Overall, Phase I focuses on teaching the athlete what it means to brace the trunk, find spinal neutral, and breathe correctly through all of this. Thus, Phase I is named “Basic Trunk Stability”.
Then, Part II covered the next step in the trunk training progression – taking that newly developed trunk stability and postural awareness, and further cementing it through more challenging and dynamic movement. This meant taking a progressive step from holding static postures against relatively static forces (i.e. gravity) seen in Phase I, and  moving to a force absorption emphasis. In other words, learning to absorb varying and dynamic opposing forces. For these reasons, Phase II is dubbed “Dynamic Trunk Stability”.
Today we will discuss the final Phase of my philosophy on trunk training. This phase centers on taking the dynamic stability developed in Phase II and progressing it from force absorption capabilities to force expression potential. In other words, we train our athletes to use the trunk musculature to transfer and express forces for improved performance. In a baseball sense, this means transferring energy rotationally through the trunk. Thus, Phase III is named “Power/Speed” training for the trunk in my program.
As stated in the previous installments, this series aims to be informative and practical, thus brief context and explanations are given for eact phase and categories of movement, while plenty of exercise examples are given and illustrated.
Overview: once the goals of Phase I (static trunk stability, postural awareness, effective breathing, basic trunk musculature strength) and Phase II (further multi-planer strengthening, dynamic stability capabilities, force absorption ability) have been met, Phase III can then be initiated.
Phase III should not only incorporate the most ballistic, challenging, and complex exercises up until this point, but also the most sport-specific to enhance transfer to baseball/pitching. Thus, this phase should be the ultimate step in the off-season progression, culminating just prior to the pre-season/regular season.
Goals:
Duration: typically 4-8
The overall theme of this phase is to take the trunk stability gaimed durging the initial phase and the subsequent energy absorption/dynamic stability learned in Phase II, and use that to ensure safe execution of Phase III.
While Phase I and II can improve performance, they primarily serve to reduce the likelihood of injury both on the field and in training. By doing this, we know that we can safely progress to more advanced and ballistic movements, such as ones that mimic throwing/pitching/hitting, yet potentially with greater loads (such as that of a medicine ball).
Sample Exercises and Progressions:
Medicine Ball Slam (Core Stiffness) ->
Band Rotation ->
From hubpages.com
Medicine Ball Scoop Toss ->
Medicine Ball Rotational Throw ->
Medicine Ball Rotational Throw (w/ Walk In) ->
Medicine Ball Rotational Throw (w/ Plyo Ball ® Rebound) ->
Medicine Ball Caber Toss ->
Overall, the progressions in this phase tend to move in the following direction:
Benchmarks: overall, the athlete should strive to produce, transfer, and express power efficiently, effectively, and intentionally. Above all else, the athlete should also be in peak physical condition, healthy, and injury-free at the conclusion of Phase III, as this culminates with the introduction of competition play.
***
After reading this three-part series, I hope that you, the amateur-level player or coach, have a better understanding of the “core” or trunk, its responsibility as a stabilizer of the spine and vehicle for energy transfer.
Also, this piece should help provide some kind of framework for training the trunk, and some examples of how to to go about doing so. While this isn’t the only way to view trunk training, it is one way to go about it, and one that should provide a safe and viable path through the off-season in preparation for the competition season.

"""Core Training” – What It Is and How to Progress It – Part II - Driveline Baseball",2016-11-23T05:32:52+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/core-training-progress-part-ii/,"In Part I of this series we discussed the general importance of the trunk/core musculature to baseball and pitching and defined its role in throwing and training. We then detailed the first phase of training for the trunk within the training programs that I write and implement for amateur ballplayers, which was classified as “Basic Trunk Stability”.
In Part II of this series 3-part series we will go over my second phase for training the trunk, “Dynamic Stability”, and set the stage for Part III, which will touch on “Power/Speed” training for the trunk.
As stated in the previous installment, this series aims to be informative and practical, thus brief context and explanations are given for eact phase and categories of movement, while plenty of exercise examples are given and illustrated.
Overview: after basic and integrated strength and stability levels are established for the trunk/core, and postural alignment has been appreciated and learned (during Phase I) we can then take the next step in training the core: developing stability against varying resistances and through more dynamic patterns.
Goals:
Duration: typically 8-12 weeks
The overarching theme of this phase is to take the trunk stability gaimed durging the initial phase of trunk stability training, and continue to develop it through more difficult exercise progressions – ones that take the form of more dynamic movement.
I personally break these exercises out into a few categories:
The semantics of the categories are irrelevant – it is simply a way for me to categorize and organize exercises in order to ensure that we progress our training into dynamic stability in all three planes of motion.
Sample Exercises and Progressions:
1. Dynamic Anti-Extension
High or Low Plank Body Saw ->
Barbell Rollout ->
Partner Rhythmic Perturbation Planks ->
Partner Random Perturbation Planks
2. Dynamic Anti-Rotation
Banded Pallof Walkouts ->
Banded Pallof Press w/ Rhythmic Perturbations ->
Banded Pallof Press w/ Random Perturbations and/or Eyes Closed
3. Force Absorption
Medicine Ball Scoop Catch (Stick) ->
Medicine Ball Scoop Catch (Absorb)
4. Movement-Based
Farmers Carry ->
Briefcase Carry ->
Briefcase Carry w/ Bottoms-Up KB
Contralateral Bear Crawl ->
Ipsilateral Bear Crawl ->
Lateral Bear Crawl

Overall, progressions generally move in the following directions:
Benchmarks: Overall, the athlete must show an understanding and proficiency in the aforementioned goals before progressing to the next phase. Generally, this takes roughly 8-12 weeks

"""Core Training"" - What It Is and How to Progress It - Part I - Driveline Baseball",2016-11-15T07:11:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/core-training-progress-part/,"In just about every baseball circle, whether it be those in high school, college, travel ball, or professional, you will hear coaches echo identical sentiments on their emphasis on strength training for baseball; you’ve probably heard it before,  “It’s all in the legs and core, especially the core!” they will tell you.
Look through social media enough and you will also see the same emphasis on “the core” from the majority of private facilities and travel ball organizations: plenty of medicine ball throws, landmine twists, and rotational band/cable movements.
This could be because that’s all a particular facility allows us to see through the lenses of their smart phones (part of the business of performance training is marketing, and some might think that sexy exercises market better than “boring” ones), or because they only have a limited amount of time to work with their athletes so they expedite the “core training” process. Either way, these types of exercises are only a portion of what core training is and should be.
While sport-specific and/or ballistic trunk exercises are important, and the movements in which they correspond (rotation, with the goal of utilizing the entire kinetic chain) are vital to baseball, they are only a piece of the puzzle that is performance enhancement for baseball.
For the strength coach (or sport coach) that works with their athletes in more of a team-setting, though, we are afforded the opportunity to spend nearly an entire calendar year (and generally multiple years) developing our athletes. In this way, we can slow cook the movement quality and athletic development process. Most of us already inherently know how this works to some extent: we teach the body weight squat before adding external loading; we teach the push-up before pressing; we teach the hip hinge before the Clean; etc.
Core training – or rather, training the trunk (more on the semantics below) – shouldn’t deviate from this same principle. Whether it takes ones full year, more, or less, the same progression from simple and regressive exercises to complex and ballistic exercises should still see the same adherence.
There are many effective ways to go about training the trunk. Today I would like to take some time to start discussing how I personally progress my ballplayers (at the high school level) through their core training throughout an entire off-season.
I will organize this discussion the same way in which I organize my training – by the phase – and in a more pointed fashion (also with a ton of visuals), as to be more easily consumed and practically read. And, it will all be covered over the course of a three-part series.
Part I will cover my first phase for training the trunk – Basic Trunk Stability – while Parts II and III will discuss the subsequent phases, which I call Dynamic Stability and Power/Speed.
Overview: the Basic Trunk Stability phase sets the foundation and standard for which every other trunk/core phase rests upon.
Goals:
Duration: typically 9-12 weeks
Sample Exercises and Progressions:
High Plank -> High Plank + A-Frame -> High Plank + Shoulder Taps
Low Plank -> Low Plank + Leg Lift Hold -> Low Plank + Alternating Leg Lifts
Quadruped Hold -> Quadruped w/ Opposite Reach and Hold -> Quadruped w/ Alternating Opposite Reach
Side Plank Low -> Side Plank High
Glute Bridge Hold -> Single-Leg Glute Bridge -> Glute Bridge March
Partner Anti-Rotation -> 1/2 Kneeling Pallof Press + Hold -> Parallel Stance Pallof Press + Hold -> Parallel Stance Pallof Press w/ Heartbeat -> 1/2 Kneeling Chop/Lift
As you can see, progressions generally move in the following directions:
Benchmarks: Overall, the athlete must show an understanding and proficiency in the aforementioned goals before progressing to the next phase.
Generally, this takes about 9-12 weeks, and takes this long for a reason: there are plenty of progressions that make these basic trunk stability exercises (the high plank, low plank, glute bridge, anti-rotations) much more challenging to both posture and strength. We are in no rush to get them out of this phase, as we have an entire off-season to transition from Phase I all the way through Phase III. Mastering Phase I, though, is essential for the effective training of subsequent phases.
***
In Part II and Part III of this series, we will discuss more advanced trunk/core training phases in my programming, beginning with dynamic stability, and culminating with power/speed.
Great stuff. Anyone who has worked with the core knows that it NOT just about the abdominals. Thanks for spreading the word.
Excited for the next bit of info.

Learning From the Work Habits of Professional Pitchers - Driveline Baseball,2016-11-08T03:32:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/learning-work-habits-professional-pitchers/,"There are a lot of reasons to admire and emulate professional athletes when you are a young amateur student-athlete aspiring for athletic greatness. As a strength and conditioning specialist, the most obvious and observable qualities that I take notice of when working with higher level athletes pertains to their work habits.
While not every high-level ballplayer attained their professional status through an impeccable  work-ethic – many of these athletes are in the top .05% of the top .05% in terms of athletic ability, size and stature, etc – there is no denying that the vast majority who are able to not only reach these levels, but sustain them, have developed terrific work habits.
Having worked at both the amateur and professional levels, I have been afforded the opportunity to work with a caliber of ballplayers ranging from elite to developmental. More importantly though, I have been able to observe them as they work toward improving and perfecting their craft.
Through this observational lens, I have learned a lot from the these athletes; what goes into the training process of the successful pitcher. And, today, I wanted to share what work habits I have observed from professional ballplayers that typically set them apart from their younger, developing counterparts at the amateur level.
As human being, professional athletes are not much different than you and I, or anyone else for that matter. Many of them, like us, enjoy training. Many dislike it. Some love it, some hate it. Others carry indifference toward training and preparation.
What sets them apart is their relationship with training.
For starters, the typical professional athlete understands the importance of training. Not only do they know its benefits, but they appreciate what this means to the longevity and sustainability of their career, and ultimately their [and potentially their family’s] livelihood. Professional athletes tend to see the bigger picture, where many younger athletes might perceive invincibility from their innate abilities.
An athlete who can throw 90mph without ever having to prepare to throw 90mph may start to believe that they won’t ever need to prepare. Meanwhile, the professional athlete looks not only at what got them to that status, but also what will keep them there.
The professional athlete also tends to significantly respect the training process. This means embracing it even if they don’t like to strength-train, condition, prehab, rehab, or prepare. They understand what it means to their career, and that work-ethic can become a limiting factor for many as their careers wear on.
I’ve met many high-level athletes that will openly admit that they do not enjoy training. Yet they do it anyway, for both the sake of organizational compliance (insubordination is not a good look) and because they acknowledge the benefits that come as a result of training.
The ones that don’t enjoy training and resort to avoiding the work tend to find their way out of the game sooner rather than later anyway, as they are getting paid to do the work.
I’ve also seen highly talented amateur athletes at the high school level do the very same – avoid training and preparing because they don’t enjoy it as much as playing and practicing. For them, their talent may keep them in the game for longer than you would expect, but there is still a shelf life on talent, and the ceiling for potential performance seems to lower over time as well.
A young, amateur pitcher or ballplayers should take the lead from professional athletes – not in how they train, but how they approach their training from a mental standpoint.
Another quality that I have observed many professional ballplayers to possess is the desire to take ownership of their own training process.
Taking ownership does not necessarily mean weeding out the parts of physical preparation that they don’t enjoy or that are the most difficult. It is about making decisions in the preparation process to put their individual in the best position to be successful each day on the field.
As an athlete this isn’t about making these decisions alone, though. Using the resources around you or seeking out additional resources is how you learn what methods work, and then putting them to practice is how you determine if they work for you.
This takes an open mind and some resourcefulness. When you have/find resources to help you develop your routines, such as your high school coach, you have to be willing to trust their best intentions. Giving their methods a shot (especially if they don’t jive with your preconceived beliefs or the opinions of others you’ve worked with) takes a truly open mind. Either their methods will work for you, or they won’t. If they don’t, that is ok, because something positive is coming out of the process: you are learning what does and does not work for you.
Many professional athletes take it a step further by asking “why?” certain training measures do and don’t work, or why they are or are not accepted by an organization.
For example, some professional organizations utilize the Olympic lifts or their derivatives, while others staunchly ban them. Imagine the professional pitcher that used Olympic lifts in college or in one pro organization, only to be signed by an organization that does not allow them.
A lot of communicating must go on between the player and coaching staff after the fact in order to determine what methods will work best for both parties – whether that is Olympic lifts or some alternative. This conversation can only occur, though, if the athlete understands what works best for them and has some semblance of a rationale as to why it works.
We can’t expect a 15-year old to know what works best for them. Nor can we expect them to understand the “why”. But, young athletes can emulate this process by being open to coaching and willing to experiment. They will learn a lot in the process.
Finally, something you will notice when watching many professional ballplayers prepare and train is that their is little hype or fanfare that goes into each training or prep session.
While some may come in with excitement and fire to train, it is not a show, nor is it a game – it is about the work.
I liken it to clocking in and out of work each day. The committed professional comes in at the start of their day, “punches their timecard” and proceeds to work.
The day may entail the following:
They will  fuel up before upon arrival, and then prep (warm-up, foam roll, stretch, etc) before practice; they will practice and then fuel up at lunch; they will get their lift in for the day; they will fuel up again and prep some more; they will play, and then they will punch out and go home.
For the most part these ballplayers enjoy their work and craft, and they love the game of baseball. But, when the training process is a daily one, it becomes more about routine than hype, and putting yourself in the best position to compete when the lights turn on at night.
This doesn’t mean we should steal all of the fun out of the game for younger athletes, though. Developing athletes, of course, can be easily excited, and oftentimes they need that to retain enjoyment in the game as they get through their work. But, as a coach, parent, or even a player, it is important to slowly (we’re talking over the course of years) encourage a natural maturity in the training process as the amateur student-athlete themselves matures as a person.
***
Amateur athletes should not be expected to train like professional athletes; the bodies, minds, and capabilities of, say, a 15-year old and 25-year old are not equal.
But, younger athletes can in fact learn from the way professionals go about their daily training process to help them carve and shape their own routines and work habits. My hope is that this discussion helps illuminate some of these positive work habits that many professional ballplayers possess so that they can be encouraged to the young aspiring, developing student-athlete.

"The “Big Lifts”, Common Mistakes, and How to Fix Them – Part III – The Deadlift - Driveline Baseball",2016-11-01T08:21:21+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/big-lifts-common-mistakes-fix-part-iii-deadlift/,"In the first installment of this three-part series we discussed one of the most widely used and accepted exercises in all of performance training, the Squat, some of the common flaws seen by novice trainees when performing it, and a couple of solutions for those faults.
Part two addressed the same themes, except this time with another prevalent and popular exercise, the Bench Press. Today we will spend some time looking at one final exercise to wrap up this series – the Deadlift.
As stated in Part I of this series, and now said again as a reminder, the exercises chosen for discussion (the Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift) were purposely chosen for a couple of reasons, as were the common faults seen in those exercises:
With the above disclaimer in mind, let’s discuss the Deadlift, the major common faults that I see when novice athletes perform it, and some solutions to rectify the issue.
The Deadlift has the potential to be one of the greatest exercises implemented in a program for nearly any sport. If the sport or activity requires lower body strength and power, especially from the posterior chain (as most do), then the Deadlift can be a major key to performance enhancement.
But, for all of its potential rewards, it does carry some significant inherent risks. If performed improperly or carelessly, each repetition of the Deadlift can bring a person one step closer to serious back pain and injury. Thus, correcting any faults seen in technique must be priority number one when implementing the Deadlift.
Lacking a Consistent Set-Up
One common theme that seems to resonate with a novice trainee who has no prior experience with the Deadlift, or has limited experience, is the lack of a set up.
Now, the situation that I have at the high school level is different than with Driveline-U. At DeLand High School I am able to implement a teaching progression in order to take my athletes from zero Deadlift experience (or bad Deadlift experience) and work them directly into the technique for which I am looking. That is why I typically start by training the Hip Hinge (unloaded) first, then spend 9 weeks progressively loading and training the RDL before ever teaching the Deadlift (more below).
With Driveline-U, the athlete (much like anyone reading this) is usually Deadlifting on their own prior to coming into the program, thus their form will vary. Generally, these athletes walk up to the bar, hardly address it whatsoever before squatting down (or bending down at the lumbar spine) to grab the bar. They then will spend 5-10 seconds or more preparing themselves in the bottom while their arms and body loosely hang there. Then, they will contort their neck into extension to look at the ceiling, and pull with all of their might, sometimes snapping their body like a toy as they go from zero to full-tension in a split second.
Thus, my first recommendation for nearly all of those Driveline-U participants is to standardize their set-up for a more consistent and safer pull.
Here is the standardized set-up I suggest they begin with:
1. Address the Bar: walk up to the bar with your feet roughly hip width, and with your feet under the bar so that, when standing and looking down), the bar blocks the view of the knot of your shoe laces. (This means the bar will not start against the shins when standing)
2. Hip Hinge Down to the Bar: this is one reason why I personally teach the RDL first. I want the athlete to know how to reach for the bar (or any object on the floor) without necessarily having to squat to do so, and certainly without bending at the lumbar spine. By displacing the hips back and hip hinging to the bar we accomplish 3 things:
A) We tension the hamstrings prior to the start (this can come in handy down the road if we want to take advantage of the Strength-Shortening Cycle)
B) We set the hips back and the shoulders over the bar, rather than squatting to the bar with our shoulders behind the bar and hips underneath us (there’s a reason why it isn’t called the Bottom-Loaded Squat…)
C) We are now ready to get into a favorable “set position”
3. Get Set by Pulling Your Hips Down and Chest Up: I’ve heard the cue, “wedge yourself down to the bar“, and I like that one. But, generally I will tell my athletes to Pull themselves down to the bar so that they simultaneously lower their hips slightly, raise their chest (and flatten out their spine), while also pre-tensioning their lats and taking some slack out of the bar. By pulling themselves down, the have to engage the upper body, which is vital for the Deadlift. Also, this gives them a chance to find their ideal hip-height. I am not one to dictate an exact height, but I have my athletes strive to achieve the following:
Keep the shoulders above the hips and the hips above the knees.
This zig-zag shape does allow for some wiggle room when it comes to the height of the hips, depending on what is comfortable given the athlete’s levers, but it is sure to keep them away from a squat (hips parallel to the knees) or a risky bend (hips parallel to the shoulders).
Hip height during the set up can make or break a Deadlift.
Hips parallel to the knees, making it more of a squatting pattern and putting the shoulders behind the bar
Hips parallel to the shoulders, making for a precarious movement pattern under load
Shoulders above hips, hips above knees.
4. Final Preparation – Take Some “Slack Out of the Bar”, Breathe, Tuck Your Chin, Go: Down the road, the athlete can decide if they want to use the Stretch-Shortening Cycle (i.e. the Stretch Reflex) in their set-up – which will require the set-up to be much faster (thus, it is an advanced method) – or if they’d rather take a little longer addressing the bar, and take “slack” out of the bar as well.
For beginners, I try to teach the latter, as it promotes full-body tension and a deliberate set-up (when beginners will generally want to rush through it). When the bar is loaded, it will tend to have a little bit of “slack” (meaning the bar will actually move upward first without the weight) which can often be heard as a clicking sound when the pull is initiated. The bar may also bend slightly upon first pull, before the weights actually levitate at all.
This is why “taking the slack out of the bar” is important – an athlete can essentially eliminate this inconsistent load and speed curve off of the floor by getting rid of it early with some tensioning.
In other words, if the bar is loaded up to 225 lbs, the athlete should think about pulling just under 225 lbs in their set up (maybe 200 lbs) for just a second or two. Since ~200 lbs is less than 225 lbs, the bar will not move off the ground, but the “slack” will have been removed.
During these couple of seconds the athlete should also finalize their set up with a giant breath in to solidify abdominal pressure, and tuck their chin down for a neutral cervical spine. Then they will pull!
No matter the load or the repetitions, the athlete can be confident in the safety and effectiveness of their Deadlift given the consistent set-up.
***
To briefly reiterate: the goal of this 3-part series was not to discuss the legitimacy or efficacy of using any one of the “Big Three” exercises – the Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift – or their variations for the baseball pitcher. Nor was it to dictate that they must be implemented, and that they must be implemented in this manner.
Rather, the goal of this series was to acknowledge that the “Big Three” are appropriately named this for a reason – they are widely used and widely effective – and thus can be expected to be getting usage in weight rooms across the country, probably as we speak. Thus, we should discuss some of the common faults seen when novice trainees begin implementing these exercises and their variations, and propose ways to correct them.
This series is not an all-encompassing guide to any of these complex exercises, nor did it address all common flaws seen when athletes perform them. Therefore, if you have any additional questions please feel free to drop them in the comments below, or email me directly at [email protected]

"The ""Big Lifts"", Common Mistakes, and How to Fix Them - Part II - The Bench Press - Driveline Baseball",2016-10-25T02:14:29+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/10/big-lifts-common-mistakes-fix-part-ii-bench-press/,"In part one of this series we discussed the some of the common technical culprits that are generally seen in the squat – an exercise that is one of the most prevalent and effective exercises in all of performance training.
Today we will discuss another major exercise that not only has at least some variation of it used in nearly every strength and conditioning program, but that also is a staple exercise for the Driveline-U program: the Bench Press.
Some semantics to first get out of the way: when I use the term Bench Press, let’s understand that I am applying the term generally for all bench pressing variations – just as “squat” can be a general term for the squatting movement as a whole – unless otherwise denoted (e.g. if I say “Dumbbell Bench Press”, or “Barbell Bench Press”)
The purpose of this discussion is not to debate the merits of the bench press for baseball pitchers. Rather, since the bench press is generally used in nearly every program in some fashion or another (from baseball to football, bodybuilding to powerlifting, and from training age 0 to 20), we will instead discuss some of the technical faults seen in novice lifters when performing the Bench Press, and then pose some solutions to correct them as simply as possible.
Let’s begin with the set up.
The Bench Press is obviously an upper-body dominant movement; personally I categorize it as an upper-body press/push (more on this later). But, that does not mean it has no lower-body involvement whatsoever.
In fact, a strong bench press actually incorporates a good amount of the lower-half to generate tension and stability. Very few novice athletes understand this though, as I have seen through countless sets in the high school weight room and via video in the Driveline-U program. This isn’t necessarily the fault of the athlete, as very few amateur-level coaches will teach much to do with the lower-half during the bench press (that is, unless they are weightlifting coaches teaching foot placement and lower-back arch).
Regardless of the reasoning, the athlete should learn to utilize the lower-half during the bench press for optimal efficiency and strength.
So, what needs to happen in order to create tension in the lower-half during the bench press? For starters, here is what we don’t want to see: wobbly legs, an unsteady torso, and “happy” or “jumpy” feet. Instead, we want to see firmly planted, activated hips, and a rigid torso.
Here’s the analogy I like to give: imagine a wooden dining table. First picture it with wobbly legs that aren’t screwed in. Could we eat dinner on the table? Sure, but could we stand on the table to, say, change the light bulb in the light hanging overhead? Probably not without it collapsing underneath us.
Now picture the same table with the legs screwed in tightly. Not only would it serve as a sturdy dinner table, but it could also hold a lot more weight.
It is a crude example, but hopefully it gets the point across that tension in the lower-half can create stability for the rest of the body.
To create tension in the lower-body during the bench press, I generally make the following suggestions:
Also, I may use the following exercise to help the athlete find the appropriate stance, foot placement, and glute activation:
If the feet aren’t firmly planted and the hips not fully-tensioned, the hips will sag and the lifter will know it instantly. On a side note, this is a teaching exercise for me, meaning the weight is not important. We just want the athlete to feet the right set-up position.
Now let’s talk about a common upper-body fault.
Above I discussed how I personally categorize the Bench Press as an upper-body press/push movement, and many of you rolled your eyes and said, “Well, duh!”
But, the reason for noting this categorization is because I am actually separating the bench press from other movements that, on the surface, appear to be a press or push – such as the push-up or landmine press.
These movements, rather, are what can be known as “Upper-Body Reaches” whereby the difference lies in the movement (or lack thereof) of the scapulae during the repetition.
During upper-body pressing exercises, such as the Bench Press, the scapula must remain locked down in retraction on the bench for the entire duration of the rep and set, for both safety and efficiency. That is because the Bench Press is a closed-kinetic chain movement where nearly all of the movement is coming through the arm. Retracting the scapulae during the Barbell Bench Press, Floor Press, and Dumbbell Press not only provides a stable base through which to press the weight, but it also decreases the distance that the bar must travel during the rep (less distance at the top) thus necessitating less overall work each rep.
Push-ups, landmine presses, and cable presses, on the other hand, are defined as upper-body reaches due to their open kinetic chain nature and freedom of the scapulae to move. In fact, these movements must incorporate proper glenohumeral rhythm and timing in order to be most safe.
Yet, it is in the inclusion of the Bench Press with novice trainees that we often see so much scapular protraction (or reaching) at the end of each repetition. They reach for the ceiling, rather than push though the base (i.e. the retracted scapula).
Will one repetition of reaching under a heavy load necessarily hurt the throwing shoulder? Maybe not. But, will varying volumes and intensities culminate in the insidious onset of discomfort or pathology over time? More than likely.
The idea, then is to educate the athlete on scapular positioning prior to ever pressing the barbell or dumbbell for the first time. In fact, I personally include it as a part of the set-up procedure. If we are going to teach the athlete to create a stable base with the lower-half (as discussed above) then we ought to teach them to create an equally stable base in the upper extremities.
This takes some visual demonstrating, verbal cues, and lightly loaded experience. But, with time and diligence, scapular retraction during the Bench Press can not only be learned, but it can be appreciated as a mechanism to create a stronger and more effective Bench Press as well.
***
While the Bench Press may make up varying factions of any one coach’s program, it is critical that when it is utilized, that it is done so in the safest and most effective manner – much like any other exercise.
The aim of this discussion was to discuss two major technical flaws with the Bench Press when implemented by novice trainees, and to provide a means to help correct them. In part three of this series we will discuss the Deadlift.

"The “Big Lifts”, Common Mistakes, and How to Fix Them - Part I - The Squat - Driveline Baseball",2016-10-18T01:31:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/10/big-lifts-common-mistakes-fix-part-squat/,"Part of my responsibility for Driveline Baseball is not only to write weekly blog posts, but also to serve as a resource for the Driveline-U program.
The Driveline-U program gives me the unique opportunity to work with many athletes, in addition to the several hundred that I work with at a daily basis in the high school setting, only from a distance. The interesting part is that the two population groups that I work with generally possess similar characteristics; they are amateur athletes with very limited training experience (training age in the 0-2 year range).
As a result, these two population groups – the high school athletes and the Driveline-U players – inevitably too exhibit many similarities in their lifting technique as well. It has been, in a sense, enlightening to see that the athletes of DeLand High School in Central Florida tend to have the same technical movement proficiencies and deficiencies as, say, a college freshman ballplayer in Kansas, a high school sophomore in California, or a graduating high school senior in Pennsylvania – given they possess the same training experience, of course.
Because of this, a lot of the feedback given to new Driveline-U members in regards to the first iteration of their lifting videos sound very much alike. This has made me realize that the feedback that I am disseminating to each Driveline-U athlete would most certainly benefit many other athletes.
Thus, I have decided to write a three-part series discussing three of the major exercises that we evaluate in the Driveline-U program (and that I personally evaluate at the high school level as well), the common mistakes that I generally see with each, and some suggested fixes for each.
Today we will discuss the Squat.
*we do not advocate zercher squats, but they are sweet*
The squat is one of the greatest bang-for-your-buck exercises in all of strength and conditioning, incorporating nearly every muscle that you can think of from the waist down and, if done right, from the waist up as well.
Doubt the squat’s efficacy or effectiveness? Allow me to point you to its prevalence in the sport of Powerlifting (the “Big 3” in Powerlifting are the Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift), in the sport of Olympic Weightlifting (Cleans and Snatches incorporate the Front Squat and Overhead Squat, respectively), in the training for nearly every individual team or individual sport, and even in the aesthetic sport of body building.
A major key to the Squat’s effectiveness is its versatility; there are hundreds of squat variations. You can load the weight anteriorly (in the front), posteriorly (in the back), off-set or unilaterally (one-sided), or overhead. You can use all sorts of resistances, such as barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, landmines, bands, chains, bodyweight, or sandbags. You can perform it with many different stances, like wide, narrow, off-set, or unilateral (one-leg). There are various speeds, tempos, and ranges of motion to perform the squat as well. You can even perform it ballistically through various jumps.
With all of these factors in mind, there are countless permutations of squat variations to choose from. Combine this with its proven effectiveness and you’re left with one of the greatest, most versatile exercises imaginable – one that would be beneficial to just about any athlete, including the baseball pitcher.
That being said, none of these exercises should be considered available for use until the athlete proves that they can proficiently and safely perform the most basic regression of the squat: the bilateral squat. And, it is this basic regression that most struggle with, oftentimes without even knowing it.
One of the most common mistakes that I see with young trainees is the misunderstanding of the involvement of the hips in the squat’s descent. Most athletes, in my experience, simply think that the squat means they need to descend straight down. While the ultimate goal of the squat is to lower the center of mass by bending the knees, there is great hip range of motion occurring as well. Failure to utilize the hips properly will lead to a reliance on not only knee-flexion, but a compensation of greater ankle dorsiflexion (deeper ankle bend) as well.
Caption: here the lifter descends without appropriately displacing the hips posteriorly (backward). The knees translate forward, and the ankles must pick of the slack. Without good ankle range of motion, the spine ends up contributing significantly to bending as well. Know that the Front Squat’s anterior loading requires less hip displacement posteriorly, but generally lifters use Olympic Lifting shoes in order to elevate their heal, thus increasing dorsiflexion availability.
Instead, the lifter should attempt to displace the hips posteriorly as they descend into the squat. By doing so, greater hip flexion contributes to the overall descent, as opposed to ankle dorsiflexion and/or lumbar flexion.
In order to teach this to my athletes, we utilize the body weight squat on day one of training, while doing so with a tempo under my control. In other words, I have my athletes perform the body weight squat together at a set speed that I dictate by counting for them: 3 seconds down, 3 second pause at the bottom, followed by a controlled upward phase.
By controlling their tempo, a couple of major points can be emphasized in order to improve hip displacement.
First, I have my athletes exaggerate the posterior shift of their hips. In fact, I actually tell my athletes that their first move will be backwards with the hips, not down, and to “poke their hips back” on my command. Thus, the first set or two will begin with me cueing them to take a deep breath in, followed by, “Hips back!”
Once they flex the hips slightly, then we commence the downward phase of the movement.
After exaggerating this for one to two sets, we then smoothen out this process. At this point, I will then begin cueing the athletes to descend back and down into the squat, as if they are attempting to sit into an imaginary chair placed several feet behind them. They must reach for the chair as they sit into the squat, thus continuing to displace the hips posteriorly as they descend.
Knee control and foot pressure is also a vital point that goes hand in hand with hip displacement, and must also be mentioned.
Very rarely do I see an athlete that knows exactly how their knees should tract as they descend into the squat. Many athletes experience knee valgus, where their femurs adduct and their knees collapse inward.
Even if their knees don’t cave inward, they usually don’t abduct at the hips optimally. Athletes may feel like knee valgus is the strongest way to move the weight, but that is because it is the path of least muscular resistance, if you will. In other words, it feels “easier” because the muscles of the hips are not being used. But, this is an extremely vulnerable position for the knees and entire body, especially as the loads and volume increase.
More often than not, simply addressing the starting position and stance can help correct this issue, or in the very least attenuate it.
For starters, I tell my athletes the following up front: not everyone will squat the same. Limb and joint shapes and sizes can dictate what is deemed an “appropriate” squat stance, as can the loading pattern (e.g. front vs. back squat). So too can pathology.
But, with the bodyweight squat being our starting point, I generalize the stance to at least foster a solid base of movement quality:
“Feet a little wider than hip width. Toes out at 1 o’clock and 11 o’clock”
Before the squatting purists condemn me for generalizing the squat and also allowing the toes to point out, understand that setting this as the preliminary standard and allowing the athlete to adjust according with time and experience has yielded better results in my experience than strictly setting the toes straight ahead, or allowing the athlete free reign when picking the bodyweight squat.
A squat stance that begins unnecessarily wide (which often happens with an inexperienced trainee who has little or no coaching) coupled with little motor control or hip abduction strength (all common with new trainees) can inevitably lead to the aforementioned knee valgus. Too narrow of a stance may or may not contribute as much to knee collapse, but it can certainly derail a squat if the shape and size of the hip socket doesn’t allow for adequate or pain-free hip flexion. Thus, finding the right squat stance is a key aspect to address early in coaching the squat.
Teaching of hip abduction and external rotation itself can also improve knee tracking. In other words, learning how to create and feel tension in the hips prior to and during the descent. One way to teach this is to cue the athlete to do the following in the squat stance prior to descending:
“Screw your feet into the ground”
We are not trying to get the athlete to literally turn their feet, but rather, to lock them into the floor with slight external rotation and abduction of the hips. The movement is subtle, but the athlete will feel significant tensioning in the outside of the hips, while feeling the knees move outward slightly. This is a great initial starting position to set the athlete up for appropriate knee tracking during the descent.
Once the stance and set position above are understood, I would emphasize that the athlete “spreads the knees in order to make room for the upper body” as they descend. Again, the goal is to force slight external rotation and abduction of the femurs on the descent.
With these cues and set-ups hammered home under minimal to no external loading, the athlete will begin to have some cognitive awareness of what tension in the hips should feel like, and how the knees should track. The ascent, then, should self-organize and fall into place. Although, external cues such as a mini resistance band around the knees can facilitate the process as well, as can hip abduction and external rotation strengthening exercises during the warm-up or workout.
***
The squat may be one of the most beneficial and versatile movements in strength training, and can be used for nearly any sport or physical activity. But, with the potential reward that can be attained with the squat comes a heavy responsibility; there must always be proper coaching and diligent practice of the movement – it takes a slow and steady progression. And, without adequate coaching and practice, an even greater price may end up needing pay in the form of chronic or acute injury as a result of dysfunctional squatting under high volume and/or load.
Thus, athletes and coaches must leave their ego at the door and strive to fortify movement quality before seeking load and variation.

"Using the Warm-Up for Movement Quality, Conditioning, and Recovery - Driveline Baseball",2016-10-11T06:38:46+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/10/using-warm-movement-quality-conditioning-recovery/,"The warm-up in baseball is an integral part of the throwing and pitching process. It is not simply a mundane obstacle that we must hurdle in order to get to the game or gain access to the bullpen. Likewise, the same can be said about the warm-up in training. It isn’t about getting through the warm-up in order to make it to the training session itself. It is about utilizing the warm-up to our advantage – to get things accomplished.
In both cases the warm-up serves to facilitate the subsequent session, yes, but it can also be used to make valuable change and progress as well. Today we will discuss 3 ways in which the warm-up, in a training context, can be used to accomplish more than just warming-up.
The greatest argument that we can make for taking a stock and stale warm-up and turning it into an efficient mini training session is that – if taken seriously – it is done nearly every day in some fashion, whether it is before a practice, game, or training session. And, you know how the cliche goes, “If it is important, do it every day.”
If we subscribe to this expression, we can see the value in inserting important aspects of performance training into our warm-ups. Not only does this establish a more narrowed focus on improving performance and reducing injuries, but it also creates greater exposure to what’s most important, and movement quality is something that is very important to baseball performance.
Consider the athlete or pitcher that has movement limitations, such as those in the ankles or hips. Rather than simply inserting mobility or soft tissue drills into the training session itself and only exposing the body to this stimuli a handful of times each week, we could instead (or additionally) add ankle and hip mobility drills into the warm-up.
Likewise, core stiffness/trunk stability could be placed in the warm-up for much greater frequency and overall volume as well.
Exercises such as hip mobility drills (e.g. half-kneeling hip flexor mobility) or thoracic spine mobility drills (e.g. 3-point t-spine rotations) could be inserted after the dynamic portion of the warm-up, once blood flow has been redistributed to the skeletal muscles and core body temperature has increased. In this way, the typical conclusion to the warm-up – arm circles, trunk twists, or leg swings – could be replaced with more goal-oriented mobility or stability drills. This adjustment could be made in both the individual and in the team setting as well.
Finally, consider certain athletes that are learning new movements – for example the squat – and are only getting 1-2 exposures to it per week during training sessions. An easy way to give them some more experience with the movement is to add it into the warm-up. But, this isn’t about exposing them to the movement just for the sake of mindless experience. The movement must be as crisp and clean as we can make it. Thus, coaching (or self-coaching) must be diligent and thorough, even if it is “just” a warm-up.
Personally, I refrain from using challenging movements in the warm-up if I plan on one day teaching that movement to my athletes. In this way, I avoid creating bad habits that I will later have to break.
For example, in my experience the Lateral Lunge is often butchered during team warm-ups. Athletes put their hands on the knees, let their chests fall, and half-heartedly shift from side to side. Rather than allowing this to happen for weeks or months on end until I actually introduce proper lateral lunging in the weight room, I will omit it from the warm-up. Once I have taught it in the weight room though, I will then use it liberally during movement prep to reiterate it as a key movement for performance enhancement.
Whether it is a personal limitation, a general restriction observed in many of your athletes as a coach, or key movements that need reiteration, the warm-up is a great way to increase frequency and volume of movement and drills that matter the most.
The warm-up can also have other desired overall outcomes than just warming-up or movement preparation – it can be an alternate mode to accomplish other forms of training. Let’s discuss a couple of ways in which the warm-up can be a substitute for other methods of training.
For any athlete that struggles with general fitness, the warm-up can be an effective, non-intimidating, and quite possibly an inviting way of building a base of general physical preparation and aerobic fitness.
Before you roll your eyes and ask, “who would actually be challenged by a warm-up?” think about your population.
Do you have any overweight or “out of shape” players on your roster? How about the kid that looks exhausted after throwing just 20 pitches, or after a couple rounds of PFPs? What about the athletes that can swing it and throw it, but that’s about all they are in shape to do? If the answer was yes to any of these questions, then general physical preparation is the solution, and the warm-up can be the vehicle for implementing it.
Mind you, the above situations happen often at the high school level, yes, but they can even occur at the collegiate level when kids walk on or get deals based on their baseball prowess despite a lack of fitness capacity or a bad body.
Rather than simply sticking these athletes in their own group, holding them over later than everyone else to do extra conditioning, and instead of making them jog the warning track or walk on an inclined treadmill, why not try the less invasive and intimidating warm-up?
Now, it shouldn’t be just any old warm-up – i.e. the five-minute show-and-go type of warm-up, or a slow, uninspiring warm-up. It must actually be challenging, and it will most likely need to be extended. For example, try stringing together multiple calisthenic or dynamic-based movements, while interspersing occasional slow, mobility-based movements. In this way, the athlete can get a challenge aerobically without exhausting or fatiguing themselves to a greater extent than desired.
An example would be to perform this “circuit” warm-up three to fives times through:
One last anecdote before you shrug off the practicality or effectiveness of the warm-up as conditioning: I have seen it done and done very well. Not just at high school, but at the professional level too.
In the past we have discussed alternate methods for recovery, such as the Recovery Circuit. Another great method for eliciting a recovery-effect is the warm-up.
Personally I am a firm believer in movement as being the greatest key for enhanced recovery. When it comes to my own training, I find that when I take complete off-days in between intense training sessions that I come back to the subsequent training session feeling more sore and beat up.
Whereas, when I include some form of active recovery on my off-day – whether it be a Recovery Circuit, some beach volleyball, or a bike ride – I feel much more ready to perform in the weight room. My athletes generally convey the same feelings during our conversations on the matter. Movement is king when it comes to recovery, and there is science and physiology behind it (although we won’t touch on that today).
Much like the warm-up for conditioning, the warm-up can also be a great recovery tool, especially for the well-conditioned athlete. I say this because we need not worry about well-conditioned athletes getting overly challenged by an extended warm-up.
In terms of energy systems, the goal of the extended warm-up will be somewhat the same for both the conditioned and reconditioned athletes: we will be looking to foster an aerobic training component, not glycolytic. In the case of recovery (unlike conditioning) we aren’t looking to build aerobic fitness, but stimulate a parasympathetic response from the nervous system so that we can enhance recovery. Thus, the the extended warm-up for recovery should not overly fatigue the body. It should be paced well, and should last 15-25 minutes generally.
Not only can we get a parasympathetic response, but we are also facilitating recovery by using movement – all kinds of movement.
The warm-up can also serve as a great unloading session for a team or athlete. Instead of a complete off-day as a way of unloading or deloading the body, we can use the warm-up as an active recovery session. I especially like to do this in-season. For example, I recently utilized the extended warm-up with my high school volleyball squad.
The girl’s volleyball team trains in-season on Monday’s and Wednesday’s. A week or two ago, we had to cancel their Monday session for whatever reason, and on Thursday they had their most significant regular season match of the year. Since they had not done resistance training in over a week, I did not want to induce too much soreness on Thursday by lifting that Wednesday. But, I also did not want to give them an entire week off from training.
We ultimately decided to use an extended warm-up Wednesday afternoon, and allowed that week to be an unloading week. Instead of just taking the week off from training altogether, we were still able to work in quality movements during the warm-up on Wednesday.
Whether it is due to scheduling constraints or quite simply a planned unloading, the extended warm-up can be an effective tool for including active recovery or light physical activity.
***
Many athletes absolutely dread the warm-up. Some programs neglect to utilize it or reinforce its value to their players. In either case, the athletes and/or coaches require a paradigm shift – one that places an emphasis on the warm-up as a tool to improve performance, rather than as an obstacle that must be hurdled to get to the rest of training.
With this value in mind, the warm-up can then be used to improve many aspects of performance, such as movement quality. Likewise, the warm-up can be utilized as an alternate means of accomplishing recovery or unloading.
It is time for all players and coaches to appreciate the value and versatility of the warm-up.

Why Developing a Training and Pitching Routine Matters - Driveline Baseball,2016-10-04T06:49:05+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/10/developing-training-pitching-routine-matters/,"When you’re a rookie-ball strength and conditioning coach – as I was during my time in professional baseball – you work with many young players. But, this is not at the exclusion of other players, as you’re also afforded the opportunity to see and interact with players of all ages and skill levels, as minor league spring training encompasses the majority of the farm system, and extended spring training often plays host to many higher-level ballplayers during their rehabilitation process. I’ve even been fortunate enough to spend some time with big league players.
Throughout my handful of seasons, I made sure to watch a lot. I not only like to watch them play, but more importantly, I always enjoyed observing them prepare. Through my observations it didn’t take long to figure out one of the greatest discrepancies between those in rookie-ball and those playing at higher levels. It wasn’t usually talent, but preparation.
I also have been able to spend some time at the collegiate level – not so much on the field, but quite a bit in the weight room. And, I have accumulated many years of coaching at the high school level, both on and off of the field. While skill is to a much greater extent than pro ball a great differentiator at the amateur level, routines still make a great deal of impact at this level and can become a major differentiator, even if it be for different reasons.
Today we will discuss the overall importance of pitchers developing a solid routine for preparation.
To see the greatest significance of preparation routines, we must start at the highest level – professional baseball.
When walking into extended spring training, you might be surprised to find how similar it looks to spring training itself. Aside from the lack of fanfare, there is not a whole lot different. When it comes to the look and performance qualities of the pitchers, there are more similarities than you would initially expect.
For starters, the pitchers practicing on a back field during extended spring training or on the rookie-ball squad don’t appear all that different in size. They will generally carry the frame and stature as any other caliber of pitcher in professional baseball.
Their “stuff” won’t appear to be a whole lot different either. You will still see 95-100 mph arms at times, and you’ll certainly see some filthy off-speed. Of course, you will surely see some inconsistencies as well. Sometimes there will be a lack of command, less eye-catching velocity or movement too. But, the disparity won’t be as obvious as you’d think.
What will really stand out if you watch long enough – perhaps after watching for a day or two – is the difference in the level of preparation, as well as its consistency over time.
This isn’t to say that all rookie-ball or lower-level players don’t prepare well – that is not what I am getting at. Rather, it is just a general observation of the populations that I’ve worked with. Ultimately it is the players at the lower levels of professional baseball who not only need skill development, but personal and professional development when it comes to their between-game and practice routines.
Where the big league pitcher generally knows exactly what he will do each and every minute leading up to first pitch on his day of the rotation, or each and every day leading up to his start, the younger pitcher in his first years of professional baseball may still walk into the clubhouse on his night to pitch with ice cream and soda, or may neglect to properly warm-up for a lifting session.
While performance and ability may hold a professional pitcher back from jumping up the ranks, it may be the routines (or lack there of) that are at the root of the problem. Failure to prepare on a daily and weekly basis with solid and consistent routines can lend itself to inconsistent performance results, especially as the seasons get longer. If a pitcher cannot sustain strong performances on a weekly basis during the rookie-ball season (which only lasts from June until September) what would make their chances any better when the season still ends in September, but instead begins in April (as is the case for the affiliates above rookie-ball)?
Whether it is a lack of understanding, a lack of want-to, or simply a relative inexperience with developing routines, inconsistent preparation can make a major impact on performance in professional baseball.
In amateur baseball skill level certainly matters, and it matters a lot. A 90 mph arm with one good off-speed pitch can certainly dominate a given high school line-up so long as it is relatively consistent. Talent is a major separator at the high school level, there is no denying that.
But, in addition to skill and ability, routines and preparation can still make a major difference to the high school player. This isn’t necessarily because the player needs them to be ready to pitch, as the high school season is exponentially less demanding than the professional season. Rather, it is because solid and consistent routines and preparation at the high school level lend themselves to greater improvements in practice and training.
The best training program in the world won’t do a whole lot of good to the player who only complies with it whenever he feels like it. Likewise, great coaching can only help a player as much as they are willing to utilize it and apply it in practice.
Thus, committing to preparation is a must for any players series about improving their pitching performance. Routines serve as the vehicle to do this.
By making preparation routine – a routine that is not only manageable, but also one that the player enjoys and leans on – the player can be assured that they are always in the best position to progress and develop.
A high school pitcher cannot be expected to have an elite-level routine. They may not even have a consistent routine at first.
At the high school level the goal should be to experiment and tinker in order to find what works best for them. From lifting, to nutrition, sleep, recovery, and warm-ups, the high school pitcher should spend the ages of approximately 14 to 18 years learning what they like, what they don’t like, how their body is affected by training and performance, and what helps them respond to both most effectively.
Then, as the player progresses to the next level – whether that be collegiate or professional baseball – they can use this knowledge to help mold a routine that will withstand a much more demanding schedule of practice and games. And, this routine will no longer serve as just a vehicle for improved performance, but also recovery in between outings over the course of progressively longer seasons.
***
While age and experience can dictate a lot of what a pitcher can and can’t do on the field in terms of performance, and in the weight room in terms of training methods, they certainly should not discourage a pitcher from learning more about themselves.
As a pitcher ages and progresses through their high school career, it is vital that they work hard to find out what training and preparation routines work best and help them accomplish their own personal goals, both in the short term and long term.
This knowledge of and experience with routine-development will then help the pitcher withstand more grueling and demanding seasons as they age. It will also inevitably serve as a major differentiator between themselves and other pitchers at the collegiate and professional levels should they reach them.

Building an In-Season Training Routine for Starting Pitchers – Part II - Driveline Baseball,2016-09-27T03:16:23+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/09/building-season-training-routine-starting-pitchers-part-ii/,"In Part I of this series we discussed the importance of in-season training for the starting pitcher in baseball, the differences between professional, collegiate, and high school demands on in-season training, and considerations for developing a week-long “rotation” or routine for high school pitchers.
Today we will further discuss the in-season routine for the high school starting pitcher by addressing ways in which the in-season routine can be adapted to the competitive schedule.
Today we will seek to answer the following questions:
It is easy to say that physical development is for the off-season, and that competing is for the competition season. But, this kind of delineation would be over-simplifying the process.
First, if performance was really just for the competition season (i.e. the spring season), then somebody would probably need to tell the travel baseball and showcase communities, along with all of the parents and players who participate in these events. Much to the chagrin and better judgement of the experts in our field, the “competition season” in baseball is practically year-round in amateur baseball. The lines between “competition” and “exposure” aren’t just blurred, at this point they’re non-existent.
Also, if the off-season was the only period for physical development, we’d constantly need to start over after every competition season, as the gains we made in the off-season prior would be all but negated. Thus, the competitive season must still include physical development, especially for the high school athlete who generally needs more physical development than more mature athletes.
That being said, in-season training should not compromise game-time performance for the starting pitcher. Ultimately, the baseball season is about baseball – wins and losses. Playing time, jobs, and athletic careers are on the line, even at the high school level.
So, how do we get the best of both worlds in-season – that is, the development of the athlete physically, all the while ensuring readiness to compete at a high level? One way is to lay out the game schedule, using the significance of each game/week to dictate the level of emphasis on training.
Since the high school baseball season is generally composed of weeks containing 2-3 games, a starting pitcher’s usage may not be able to be scripted or projected out more than a week in advance (unlike professional, which sticks to a set rotation). This means that a starting pitcher’s routine may have to fluctuate as a result. One week the training sessions may fall perfectly in place, leaving 48-72 hours of rest in between the last session prior to the next start. The next week a training session may end up being the day before.
For the weeks when things go off the script, we can look to the game schedule to determine the focus we should have on our training sessions. For the week of games that carry greater significance, such as district games, physical development may have to be minimized to ensure that the pitcher is 100% prepared to take the mound.
Conversely, weeks that don’t carry as much significance – say, games against non-district and/or weak opponents – can carry a much greater emphasis on performance training rather than on performance outcomes.
As the season progresses, we may even start to see a cycle occurring… For example:
Week 1 (Pre-Season) – Training Focus
Week 1 (Non-District) – Training Focus
Week 2 (District Games) – Competition Focus
Week 3 (Non-District) – Training Focus
Week 4 (Non-District) – Training Focus
Week 5 (District Games) – Competition Focus
Week 6 (District Games) – Competition Focus
and so on…
In a cycle like this we may even start to see a peaking effect occur, where the adaptations that occur from training hard in-season show themselves as improved performance on the field during the weeks when training is backed down.
It is the job of the strength and conditioning coach to not only develop the athlete, but to also tailor that development toward optimal readiness to compete. In the case of the baseball pitcher, this means peaking him for the games that matter most, done by creating a plan that looks at the entire competition season as a whole.
But, for those who don’t have a strength coach there to create this plan, the same approach can still be taken, all we have to do is alter training so that the body is ready to perform.
There are three simple ways to back training down as important competitions approach. If you read the textbooks, they will tell you that these should occur weeks in advance, but this takes a lot of forethought and can sometimes limit flexibility of scheduling. Even making these three adjustments the week of a big competition, though, or the week before can make a difference still.
For starters, intensity (or load being lifted) should still be kept relatively high, regardless of the week. In fact, intensity can actually be maintained no matter who you are playing. It is volume that has a great impact on fatigue, soreness, and readiness. Thus, training volume should be controlled and minimized for important game-weeks.
One way to do this would be to take the prescribed sets and reps for a given intensity on a particular week, and cut the reps in half. For example, if a training session during an important week called for 4 x 6 at 82%, the pitcher could reduce the volume to 4 x 3 at the same load. In that way, intensity is still maintained, while fatigue is minimized by reducing the volume.
Another method would be to reduce the frequency of training for that “significant” week or the one leading up to it. In other words reduce the number of training sessions. This will again help to minimize fatigue and enhance readiness to play. An example would be to go from three total body training sessions to two, or from two sessions to one. This may actually be one of the easier methods for shifting the focus from training to competition, as the high school training and competition schedules often vary from week to week. Thus, dropping one training session may be convenient.
Finally, there are adjustments that can be made to the exercises themselves. We know that Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) often comes when a) novel stimuli are given to the muscle (e.g. new exercises, new volume or intensity) or b) movements are eccentrically-focused. Thus, exercise selection and implementation during an important game-week can be dictated by their impact on the body.
For example, if Deadlifts are performed in-season, and normally full repetitions (the weight is concentrically lifted and then eccentrically lowered back to the ground – not dropped), then on a week that we want to back down the training focus a bit, we can perform concentric-only Deadlifts (lift the weight and then drop it). Similarly, movements like a step-up can be used in place of a lunge in order to reduce the eccentric stress on the muscles involved. Medicine ball throws could also be swapped in place of the usual presses. These aren’t must-do’s, but they are just some ideas that can be utilized if a pitcher knows a particular exercises causes greater fatigue or soreness, and wants to prevent this the week of a big start on the mound.
***
While this two part series does its best to discuss the starting pitcher’s training routine, especially that of those at the high school level, it should be understood that not all training and competition circumstances are going to be ideal. For this reason, adaptability is a critical trait for all high school pitchers and coaches.
Having an open mind, too, is an important attribute for both to possess, as creativity may need to be expressed in order to find a way to not only prepare for each start on the mound, but to also develop as a total-athlete during the competitive season.
It cannot be forgotten that, while the spring season is for competing, the high school level itself is for development. Thus, a sliding and fluid middle-ground must be found between the two.

Building an In-Season Training Routine for Starting Pitchers - Part I - Driveline Baseball,2016-09-20T07:30:15+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/09/building-season-training-routine-starting-pitchers-part/,"By now everyone – players, coaches, and even parents – knows the importance of off-season training for baseball. Strength, power, tissue tolerance, mobility and the likes are all factors vital for performance enhancement of the pitcher. Each, though, taking months of diligent work to establish.
When off-season training concludes, the progression from these months of hard work and dedication can be lost very quickly. It is the goal of an in-season training program to ensure that training residuals for the various sports performance characteristics gained over the course of an entire off-season remain intact.
The mission of this two-part series is to discuss the importance of in-season training, the factors that dictate in-season training schedules for the starting pitcher at various levels, and some considerations for developing the in-season training plan.
In strength and conditioning we have a term called residuals.
What a residual refers to is the amount of time a training effect will remain intact for a person or athlete once they have discontinued training for that aspect. In other words, a training residual is how long we can expect to maintain a training quality once we stop training for it.
A more clear example would be the following question: how long we can maintain maximal strength if we were to stop training for maximal strength. Here we would be trying to determine the training residual for maximal strength.
Training residuals are an important concept to the strength and conditioning coach because understanding them can allow us to best cycle training goals within the annual training plan. For example, we can cycle off a certain training goal (e.g. strength) in order to cycle on another training goal (e.g. speed) for whatever length of time a training residual allows, and then cycle back.
This is also an important concept to the athlete, not so much in the way of helping them write a training program, but in the way of understanding the year-round value of training, including the competitive season.
An entire off-season of training can surely make some impact on the athlete during the competition season, as training residuals will last to a certain extent. But, if training does not continue in-season, training effects will only diminish as the season progresses. Thus, it is imperative that some form of in-season training occurs.
But, while training is important, it should not compromise performance on the field. Which is why, as we discuss the starting pitcher’s training routine in-season, we must consider its structure and schedule in order to yield the most positive outcomes on the mound.
The current level of competition of a given pitcher is an important factor to consider for a pitcher when developing an in-season training program. This is true for many reasons: the level of competition dictates the the weight of emphasis on physical development and competition (i.e. general vs. sport-specific training), the likelihood that the starting pitcher also plays another position, as well as the schedule of games that come along with that level of competition. Let’s consider the various levels of baseball and their relation to these components.
Professional:
The professional level pitcher generally works on a 5-7 day schedule. Usually, the pitching rotation is composed of 5-6 pitchers. And, since there is always a chance of an occasional off-day, we can see 5-7 days between a start on the mound and their subsequent start. This gives the player 4 to 6 days to train and prepare between outings. Because professional baseball has full-time strength coaches at nearly every level, we won’t discuss this level too much further.
Collegiate:
Generally the collegiate level starting pitcher gets one start per week. They are usually slotted as a Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, or weekday starter. Unless roles change or circumstances dictate otherwise, a pitcher can expect to have 6-7 days in between each appearance for preparing and training.
Although not mentioned above, their is a scheduling/logistics constraint that professional players must consider, that collegiate-level pitchers must also keep in mind: travel. A “get-away day” (or travel day) can pose as an obstacle for training routines, as can the accommodations of hotels or gym access on the road.
High School:
High school pitchers, on the other hand, do not need to worry about travel (not during the spring season, anyway). Facilities and time, though, could pose as challenges at times. Without a legitimate strength and conditioning coach or weight room, it will be up to the high school athlete (or baseball coach) to take the initiative for their own training.
When it comes to the pitching schedule, a high school pitcher will generally start one game per week. But, because games occur more sparsely at the high school level (2-3 games per week) and the varying day of games, a pitcher may start on a Monday, and then not start again until the following Tuesday or Wednesday.
What’s more, unlike a rainout or postponement at the professional level (which usually creates a double-header the next day), a rainout at the high school level could mean less games or a one-game week. For these reasons, combined with the fact that the high school level is (or shoulder be) so developmentally-focused, the training schedule may change from week to week to shift the focus from pitching to physical development.
The high school pitcher will be the main focus of this discussion.
In-season training routines (much like that of the off-season) should also reflect the specificity needed for the given level of competition.
In other words, an athlete at the professional level will need specialized training – training that is both specific to the sport, the position, and the individual. Collegiate pitchers may see moderately specialized training – training that is still geared toward the sport, position, and individual, but also more general in nature. There are still many two-way players at this level, and many collegiate players still have very low training ages.
The high school pitcher, though, needs less individualization and specific training. This means more generalized training. It also means a greater need for physical training period, and less of a need for sport-specific training in addition to competition.
Fittingly, the preparation schedule of a high school pitcher allows for a higher frequency of strength training, with a week-plus generally elapsing between starts on the mound. Also, the starting pitcher at the high school level may also be a position player as well. So, the emphasis of training should be on the development of the total athlete, not just the pitcher.
Where a professional pitcher is oftentimes only given 4 days off in between starting appearances, and may need to break their training up into an upper and lower body training sessions one time per rotation each (oftentimes the two days following a start) to limit fatigue and soreness prior to the next start, the high school pitcher can take on more physical training.
Potentially having 2-3 more rest days (or more) in between each pitching appearance allows a high school starting pitcher to include multiple challenging strength training sessions each week. Not only does this allow for maintenance, it also allows growth and development.
Instead of breaking sessions into upper and lower body lifts and front loading the schedule following a start, a high school starter can instead utilize 2-3 total body sessions spread more evenly throughout the week. For example:
Day 7 – Starting Appearance
Day 1 – Total Body Training Session
Day 2 – Off
Day 3 – Off
Day 4 – Total Body Training Session
Day 5 – Off
Day 6 – Total Body Training Session
Regardless of how the exact days are structure, this approach to the weekly pitching routine for the high school starting pitcher will place a great emphasis on physical development.
For the high school pitcher whose baseball program does not have “team lifts” or a full-time strength coach, setting up a training schedule is actually somewhat easy. With a gym membership the pitcher can knock out his training whenever he pleases.
If a high school baseball program has a strength coach, or implements team lifts, this will be more challenging, as scheduling a different training session for each starting pitcher would be too difficult. When this is the case, the pitchers will simply have to adjust training intensity and/or training emphasis depending on how close the team lift is to their next appearance.
Now that we have a training schedule laid out, we should now consider how each session could be focused to best optimize development, while not making a negative impact on in-game performance.
The goal for the pitcher or coach, in terms of training, should be to ensure that fatigue is not accumulated too closely to a start on the mound. Training intensity can remain high while training for strength and power, but too much volume means muscular fatigue and soreness. And, without 48-72 hours of recovery, this can make a noticeable impact on pitching performance.
Based on the training schedule proposed above, I’d personally suggest the following progression of training session volume and intensity for the pitcher who is training on their own:
Day 7 – Starting Appearance
Day 1 – Total Body Training Session – High Volume (Recovery)*
*Day 1 will be the day following a start on the mound. The body may be fatigued and sore from throwing. In professional or collegiate baseball this is often when a “heavy” lower-body session is used, but this is due to competing demands and very little time to address them (4 days in between most starts). At the high school level, we can still challenge the body with a total body lift, but by using high volume we can help stimulate recovery from the day before, while also getting the greatest density of training in for the week.
Day 2 – Off
Day 3 – Off
Day 4 – Total Body Training Session – High Intensity (Strength/Power)**
**By Day 4 the body should be recovered from both the last appearance and the high volume training session. Now, we can use a moderate-to-low training volume with higher intensities. Since we are fully recovered we can give the body an exposure to true strength training, thus allowing this quality to stay intact during the season. If done right, with moderate or low volume, we can avoid any major soreness or fatigue.
Day 5 – Off
Day 6 – Total Body Training Session – Low Volume, Moderate Intensity (Mobility/Prep)***
***Finally, Day 6 can serve as one final “tune-up” before the subsequent appearance on the mound. Low volume will ensure fatigue and muscle damage are not incurred, while the moderate intensity allows for some unloaded jumps or lightly loaded throws if desired. Essentially this serves as a preparation session 24 hours prior to competition.
***
While the above training routine could work very well for the high school pitcher who trains on his own, it may not work for the pitcher who must train with his team on set days per week. The same formula could be used, but the days themselves may need to be more flexible.
For example, if a high school baseball program has the weight room reserved two days per week during the season (for example, Monday and Wednesday), the above training plan may not match up day for day.
In this case, adjustments will have to be made in collaboration between the pitcher and coaches. In Part II of this series we will discuss the kinds of adjustments that can be made to optimize the training schedule for a high school starting pitcher in not-so-ideal circumstances.
We’ve published other articles that are directed towards coaching, check them out here!
What about in-season training programs for position players?
I was wondering how you account for recovery time for fast vs. slow twitch fibers (for example fast twitch being jumps and slow twitch being stabilizers and assistance muscles) in you program. Also do you have micro (week long), meso (month long), and macrocycles (year long) in you r programs?
Do you account for cortisol levels and blood pH levels, are these are important factors for making progress and prevention of overtraining?
Recovery time per fiber type is more built into load/progression than specific recovery modalities, by loading them properly with volume/intensity, systematically things get more or less on the same schedule (especially with scheduled deloads in general). We use the micro/meso/macro periodization depending on their level of training; advanced athletes need serious focus on that, novices do not so much.

Relationship Between Vertical Jump Force and Pitching Velocity - Driveline Baseball,2016-09-08T10:02:54+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/09/examining-the-relationship-between-vertical-jump-force-and-velocity/,"Throughout this summer we wanted to investigate the relationship between vertical jump force production and throwing velocity. Instead of looking at vertical jump height, we instead used our Neulog force plates to examine whether the amount of force produced when doing a counter-movement jump (CMJ) was correlated to throwing velocity.
The research on the relationship between vertical jump and pitching performance doesn’t show a strong relationship, but replication of research is always a valuable endeavor.
A study on cricket players did find a moderate relationship between vertical jump and throwing velocity – but only after a multiple regression analysis.
Strength and Power Correlates of Throwing Velocity on Subelite Male Cricket Players
Found a non-significant trend was observed for vertical jump height. But after a multiple regression analysis vertical jump height reached statistical significance (r=0.51). A moderate .47 r-squared was found between vertical jump and stretch velocity. A stronger .51 r-squared was found between vertical jump and shuffle velocity.
Baseball Athletic Test: A Baseball-Specific Test Battery looked at a variety of research studies in order to create a baseball specific athletic test. He found the average broad and vertical jump increased when comparing high school, NAIA and D1 collegiate athletes.
Anthrompometric and Performance Comparisons in Professional Baseball Players found difference between Rookie, A, AA, AAA and MLB vertical jumps, but they were non-linear and showed to be non-significant after analysis.
And last, Correlation of Throwing Velocity to the Results of Lower-Body Field Tests in Male College Baseball Players found non-significant trends between vertical jump and velocity.
We ended up with 29 athletes that we had vertical jump force data and pulldown numbers and 17 athletes that we had mound velocities for using Trackman peak numbers.
Each athlete had 3 counter-movement jump (CMJ) trials with one foot on each force plate. The peak forces for the right and left leg were recorded for each jump. The forces of the right and left leg were then added together to create a ‘total force’ number for that one rep. The total for from that jump was then divided by the athletes bodyweight. The three force/bodyweight numbers were then averaged to make one measurement for each athlete.
Below you can see the results that we had when we compared an athletes force/bodyweight to pitchers pulldown and mound velocity.
*Force/bodyweight numbers are in Newtons.
We ended up finding very small r-squared for both, 0.022 when comparing avg force/bodyweight to peak pulldowns and 0.014 when comparing force/bodyweight to peak Trackman velocity.
You can also find the data for your own analysis here.
The relationship that we found between vertical jump force and velocity was nearly zero. So if we were to say that vertical has little to no impact on pitching velocity, what does that mean when looking back at the research?
[clickToTweet tweet=”If an athlete trained to throw harder – does that mean he will also jump higher?” quote=”Think of it this way: If an athlete trained to throw harder – does that mean he will also jump higher?”]
Two of the studies mentioned previously saw differences when comparing athletes of different age or performance levels (A, AA, etc). But none showed vertical jump to be predictive of pitching velocity – that’s a very important distinction to make.
In Baseball Athletic Test: A Baseball-Specific Test Battery, is it surprising when comparing the playing levels from high school to different college levels that height, weight, vertical and throwing velocity increased? Not at all. Some of those differences are obviously going to be self-selecting when we start looking at recruiting of different college levels. More importantly: Does that information mean that one directly caused the other(s) to increase? Not necessarily.
Let’s take another quick example: A 16 year old pitcher wants to work on his lower body strength to try and throw harder. He is determined in his goal and ends up sticking to a weight lifting schedule until he finished high school so he can continue to play baseball in college.
So he gets a strength coach, goes in the weight room and trains his legs using deadlifts, squats and single legged exercises. By the time that he is 18, is it surprising that he throws a little harder, jumps a little bit higher, and runs a little bit faster? No. Changes like these are not surprising to see, which is why we need to look closer at correlation and causation.
Just because measurables like vertical jump or 60 yard time increased with playing level doesn’t mean that the players playing in MLB spent hours training their sprinting and vertical jump abilities.
It certainly doesn’t mean that if they did spend time increasing those measurables that it would ALSO make them throw harder.
The relationship how athletes measure up in the weight room and their performance metrics (i.e velocity) is clearly intertwined. The likelihood of an athlete training solely to increase his vertical jump in hopes of throwing harder will be very unlikely to succeed. Why?
Because strength and power are plane specific. A vertical jump takes place in the sagittal plane while pitching takes place mostly in the frontal and transverse planes. Vertical jump is NOT a complete measure of lower body power, it is a measure of power in one plane of motion.
A sagittal plane exercise would be moving up and down like a squat, a frontal plane exercise would be moving side to side like a lateral lunge, and a transverse plane exercise would be rotation like a medicine ball rotational throw.
One study specifically found bilateral tests such as vertical jumping, horizontal jumping, and running speed in the sagittal plane did not substantially correlate with high throwing velocity. Instead they found high correlations between velocity and lateral to medial jumps for both left and right handed throwers.
Correlation of Throwing Velocity to the Results of Lower-Body Field Tests in Male College Baseball Players
“Traditional exercises performed in the sagittal plane (lunges, single-leg squats, deadlifts) should not be excluded but rather serve as a means of increasing overall lower-body power in the initial phases, such as anatomical adaptation, hypertrophy and maximum strength of an off-season strength program.”
Working out is incredibly important to an athlete’s career. Getting stronger in the weight room should be a priority.  Simply to be able to keep putting weight on the bar as time goes on is a huge task.
Instead of training for a sport specific skill that isn’t used everyday, such as a vertical jump, your weight training program should be focused on covering all three planes of motion. And if your scratching your head for ideas on how to do so, you’re in luck. We’ve talked about ways that you can train in the frontal and transverse plane before.
Throwing a baseball is in itself is a very sport-specific skill. The best predictor of performance for pitchers is going to be sport-specific skills, which in the case of baseball pitchers is velocity and command, rather than one performance measure like vertical jump distance.
When looking closer at the existing research, there was one section of Anthrompometric and Performance Comparisons in Professional Baseball Players that stood out as different that the rest.
In looking at a wide range of performance comparisons between different playing levels (Rookie ball, A, AA, AAA and MLB) the authors did find a difference in vertical jump but it was small and it didn’t linearly increase between levels. But they found bigger differences when they compared the mean and peak power (measured in Watts) of the athletes who jumped! This study also looked at baseball players as one group and didn’t differentiate between pitchers and position players.
Look at all three sections and note that the y-axis changes between each measurement. Vertical Jump was measured in centimeters (a 70 cm vertical is about 27 1/2  inches) while power was measured in Watts.
Our next step is looking past vertical jump force production and using linear position transducers like Tendo Power Analyzers and GymAware to look at how athletes jump high. We know that we can test our athletes for vertical jump and they can have the same vertical jump height but we often fail to realize that they can reach that height in difference ways. They can get there with different power metrics.
So we will be examining the peak and mean force of our pitchers so we can see how those numbers relate to velocity.
If you are curious in trying to measure your own peak and average power, we can help you out there as well. The Harman formula – which is an estimate of power output based on jump height and body mass – for calculating peak and average power can be found below:
Peak Power (W) = 61.9 (jump height (cm) ) + 36.0 (body mass (kg) ) +1,822
Avg. Power (W) = 21.2 (jump height (cm) ) + 23.0 (body mass (kg) ) – 1,393
To find your weight in kg: take your body weight in pounds (lbs) and divide it by 2.2.
To find your vertical jump height in centimeters: take your jump height in inches (in) and multiply it by 2.54.
Those will get you some good estimates if you would like to run your own study without expensive equipment such as Tendo/GymAware. Best of luck!

A Guide to Strength-Training Progression – Part II - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-30T06:06:44+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/guide-strength-training-progression-part-ii/,"In the first segment of this 3-part series we discussed how important progression is in a strength and conditioning program. Simply put, the deep-rooted goal of any training program is to utilize training stressors and stimuli in order to force the body to adapt and become more resilient to the stressors. Then, by manipulating these stressors, and their subsequent adaptations, we hope to create training effects that positively transfer to sport. We also discussed how exercise selection can be used to progressively overload the body and facilitate these positive adaptations.
Now we will look at how another very important training variable can be used to foster the same progression:
TRAINING INTENSITY
You can only do these ridiculous Zercher squats if you can lift as much as Jack.
Let’s quickly define intensity:
The traditional take one intensity as a training variable in a resistance training program is that it refers to the weight or load lifted. In this sense, an example of a training intensity would be 200 lbs on a back squat.
Another way to view training intensity is through percentages that ultimately are derived from a One-Repetition Maximum (1RM). For example, a training intensity of 85% deprived from a 1RM of 200 ls. would equate to a training load of 170 lbs.
A training max can also be reached by taking a 1RM and multiplying it by a given Training Max, which can limit a 1RM for training purposes. For example, if your lifetime personal best on back squat is 200 lbs, but you have not hit 200 lbs in several months, you may decide to use a training max that is equal to 90% of your 1RM, thus giving you a training max of 180 lbs. You can then assign a training intensity, such as the 85% previously mentioned, and give yourself a training load of approximately 155 lbs.
Going off-script slightly, from my vantage point there is another means of assigning or defining training intensity: Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) which would give way to a type of training called auto-regulation. In this manner, athletes determine just how intense the training load is for the given volumes (sets and reps) by how each particular set feels. There are multiple ways to use auto-regulation, such as the Auto-Regulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE) method (more on this below). But, ultimately, the idea is to adjust training loads based on how your body responds to training on a given day.
Personally, I use RPE with my athletes before I ever formally test an repetition maxes. If I am not feeling confident in their movement competency at that point (such as during Block Zero – or our beginner phase), I won’t risk injuring them by having them perform a rep-max test.
I also don’t want to generalize the training for all athletes, where I force them all to use a set load on each set. Thus, I will tell them to do work-up or warm-up sets until the load feels like a ____ out of 10, and then do ____ sets of _____ at that load.
Using Training Intensity to Achieve Progressive Overload
Regardless of how you use or view training intensity – as a standardized and objective training load, or as a quasi-objective rating – the main goal is to use this variable to achieve progressive overload.
There are many, many different ways to periodize a training program for positive adaptations. No matter if you prescribe to Block, conjugate, or undulating periodization, there is an underlying principle at work in all forms of periodization, and that is our theme for this entire series: progressive overload. For that reason, most strength coaches today would contend that we all use Linear Periodization. Let me explain more…
For some time Linear Periodization was thought to only be for beginners. That is because, in the most rudimentary form, it’s quite basic: training intensity starts low, while training volume starts high, while they slowly make an exchange of emphasis. Training intensity progressively increases, while training volume decreases. We work hypertrophy, then strength, then power. This is considered a very basic and entry-level approach to periodization by many.
Realistically speaking though, if you remove the training goals (hypertrophy, strength power) and just look at the overall premise, this is how all training programs progress on a meso/macro level; they progress in intensity over time. Even if they wave multiple times or just focus on one specific trait, like strength, power, or speed, they will continue to build in intensity over the course of many waves or cycles.
No matter what trait you’re looking to achieve, the ability to move a greater amount of load (higher intensity) for the same given work (e.g. repetitions) means a greater ability to achieve the goal.
In other words, if you can move more weight for the same given repetitions, you are stronger. If you are able to move more weight at the same given speed, you are more powerful. And, if you are able to move more weight for the same given time, you are more resistant to fatigue.
To make any of this possible, though, progressive overload must take place, and this is done in part by progressing exercise intensity.
Periodizing Training Intensity
Explaining the many ways in which you can manipulate training intensities in order to build your own training program would not only take more time than this simple blog post allows for, but it would also be an illogical waste of elaboration for most people. I only elaborated on the importance of training intensity above because I still believe education is an important part of the training process. It’s crucial to your success in performance training to understand why you can’t just use the same training loads for the same volume week after week and expect much to change over time.
What I will do instead is point you in the right direction to find two different training methods that a) are cheap (one is free, one is a couple of bucks), and b) can be applied directly to your current training program without completely scrapping it for a cookie-cutter program.
Pre-package programs are certainly “more convenient”, but they rarely take into account your likes/dislikes/individuality/facility-constraints/etc. They also generally cost a lot more (the price of convenience is steep) and, what happens when these programs end? By providing you with two methods that can be applied to your current and/or future programs, I am giving you knowledge – not just sets, reps, and intensities.
5/3/1
The 5/3/1 program in its entirety can be found here for free on T-Nation. This is by far my personal favorite for my own workouts. It is simple and effective. This method is applied to one exercise per training session, and should be reserved for your big-money lifts, like the squat, deadlift, or bench press. I have also used it on RDL’s and Chin-Ups with similar results.
Once you have determined your 1RM for the selected exercises, you begin by taking a training max of 90% and applying it to that 1RM. Then, you will execute 2 warm-up sets (I like to do one set of five reps at 40% of my training max, then one set of 3 reps at 50-60% of my training max), and three working sets, which will progressively increase from week to week. Each 4-week cycle looks like this:
Notice that the last working set has a plus sign (+) next to the desired reps. This indicates that this set’s goal is at least that number, but should be completed until technical failure*.
*Technical Failure: when form and technique breaks
After each 4-week cycle, the training max is then bumped up 2-5% and is then completed again. So, the next cycle would be at 92% or 95% of your 1RM.
APRE
The Auto-Regulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE) method is one that was founded long ago, but was recently summarized in a short and very cheap e-book by Dr. Bryan Mann. The APRE method is one that utilizes an approximated repetition max as a base for intensity on no more than one exercise per training lift. Again, it should be reserved for your big-money exercises.
There are 3 set methods for using the APRE:
Using the APRE10 method, you will guess your 10-rep max. Likewise, if you choose the APRE6 program, you will guess your 6-rep max. The same premise applies for APRE3. Regardless of which program you choose, it is important to note that it is okay to be wrong when guessing your rep max. You will find out just how wrong you are on the first working set, and will then adjust accordingly.
So, let’s take the APRE6 method as an example, and we will do so for the squat.
Step 1: Guess your 6-Rep Max -> 200 lbs.
Step 2: Perform the following sets…
Step 3: Use adjustment chart to change the load accordingly, then another set at to Technical Failure
Step 4: Use adjustment chart to set the load for the following week’s 6-Rep Max
By using the APRE method, you not only can make adjustments easily without prescribed percentages, but you can account for the days when you are fatigued or less prepared to train. It becomes more about the effort and intent that you’re able to provide that day,  rather than the specific percentage load.
***
These two programs aren’t the only effective methods to develop a progression of exercise intensity, but they are proven. And, what’s more, they can very easily be integrated into your current training regimen.

A Guide to Strength-Training Progression - Part III - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-29T06:04:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/guide-strength-training-progression-part-iii/,"In Part I and Part II of this three-part series we discussed the importance of progressive overload, and the use of exercise/movement progression and training intensity as means to achieve it.
For the third installment we will cover the meaning and significance of training volume to the overall training program, and how to go about using it to manipulate training adaptations to achieve your training goals.
In order to grasp just how significant training volume is, another training principle must be mentioned in addition to progressive overload: specificity.
Although progressive overload is getting all of the mentions and love in this series, the principle of specificity is equally important.
Specificity essentially means that you get what you train for. The inverse is also true: you don’t get what you don’t train for.
I am aware how incredibly obvious this sounds, but if you really think about it, you have probably witnessed many people neglecting to adhere to this “basic” concept as they go about their training.
This isn’t to say that we should only train exclusively for the most obvious characteristics of our sport. For example, to say that pitchers should only run sprints because they need to train fast to throw fast is taking the specificity principle so far as to forget that other bioenergetics are at work in baseball and recovery (more on this in my next post).
But, by using the principle of specificity, we can determine which traits are most desirable for our sport, which will allow us to focus our training in order to emphasize stimuli that will achieve the appropriate adaptations.
Now that we understand specificity, let’s take a side-step to define training volume:
Training Volume = Sets x Reps
You can also evaluate the Load Volume by:
Load Volume = Sets x Reps x Load
Either way, the goal is to track and manipulate how much work is being done during any one training session.
On the surface, higher and lower training volumes generally elicit different outcomes. 4 x 12 and 4 x 5 are two different schemes used to apply varying stress, where the former having a goal of hypertrophy or endurance, and the latter strength.
Repetitions and maximal loads capable are inverse of each other. The greater the reps desired, the less the potential is for load. Thus, higher repetition sets, such as 15-20 are used at very low training intensities. Conversely, lower repetition sets of say, 3-6, are generally performed with substantially greater loads.
With this in mind, you can start to see how training volume can be manipulated to create progression. But, first we also understand how training intensity can have an impact on the outcome of the volume used.
It isn’t always as simple as calculating your sets x reps and altering the program from week to week in order to create progression. To illustrate my point, check out this example:
3 x 12 and 12 x 3 both equate to a training volume of 36.
Yet, when we perform 3 x 12, we are generally using lower intensities and short rest periods with the intention of inducing muscular damage, ultimately stimulating hypertrophy.
12 x 3, on the other hand, could generally involve either moderate loads and varying rest to train for power and speed, or even heavier loads and longer rests to train strength and power.
Thus, training load, alone, is not always enough to track progression. This is why load volume is used quite often to track overall training volume more accurately.
By understanding training volume and its relationship with training intensity, you can start to get a better picture of how to progress training on paper (why do I say, “on paper?” …more below).
Training volume and intensity need to be manipulated, not only to facilitate gains in the off-season, but also to allow for tapering and peaking in-season. Tapering refers to the method by which the training program’s volume and/or frequency is progressively unloaded as a major competition closes in. We do this in order to allow the body to recovery and supercompensate.
Although every game is important, some may carry more significance than others. If we took the foot off of the gas pedal for every game during the baseball season (or every week), we wouldn’t get too much accomplished in terms of performance enhancement. So, to ensure improvement in-season and readiness to play for the most significant games, we can back off of the training volume and/or frequency as the competition nears.
For example, as the playoffs approach, training volume can be reduced progressively in the 3 weeks leading up. The intensity would still need to be kept high (heavy loads), but the volume would significantly decrease as to reduce the amount of muscular and neural fatigue accumulated, and to allow full recovery and supercompensation so that performance “peaks” when it matters the most.
As mentioned above, though, this is all great on paper, but another aspect can and should be considered when using volume and intensity to elicit positive training adaptations.
Now consider how difficult an exercise is, and how that relates to its training volume. One obvious example is the difference between 4 x 6 on a Back Squat versus 4 x 6 on Leg Extensions in terms of stress on the lower and total body.
Some even more subtle, yet enlightening examples would be:
All things being the same, the amount of stress and its emphasis on the body will differ depending on the varying stimuli associated with these kinds of circumstances.
When speaking about progression in performance training, there are many factors to consider, including training volume, training intensity, and exercise progression. In this three-part series we have thoroughly discussed each of these parameters.
But, to isolate any one training parameter would be a serious miscalculation of how each factor plays off of the others.
For example, to isolate training intensity would be nearly impossible, as intensity and volume are highly interdependent. Likewise, exercise difficulty/variation can have an impact on both volume and intensity. Hopefully this series has also done an adequate job demonstrating these kind of relationships between the training parameters discussed.
There are also other ways to progress training in addition to those mentioned in this series, such as frequency and duration, time under tension, and type of resistance utilized. Just because they were not mentioned here does not mean that they cannot make a big impact on training, and ultimately performance. You will just have to do some more reading.
One of the greatest limiting factors of training is the willingness to seek out more knowledge. The more you know, the more you grow.

A Guide to Strength-Training Progression - Part I - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-23T03:02:30+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/guide-strength-training-progression-part/,"As we move out of “Summer Sixteen” and into the Fall, any ballplayers who have yet to embark upon a serious strength training program due to travel baseball should now be commencing a consistent program.
For most coaches and athletes, the most difficult part of beginning a strength training program is not compliance or follow-through, but in the creation and development of the program itself. Teams, and the athletes that compose them, generally possess sufficient motivation to fuel their efforts. On the other hand, it is the knowledge and understanding of training that are much harder to come by at the high school level.
Strength and conditioning is a profession unto its own, as is baseball coaching. Thus, the high school baseball coach – or any baseball coach for that matter – cannot be blamed for not possessing a baseline knowledge on the subject. The resourceful coach, though, will acknowledge this (not believe that they know enough to get by) and seek out the best information possible to help their athletes.
The goal of this three-part series is to provide the knowledge-seeking coach or players with the information necessary to progress safely and effectively in the weight room.
Why is Progression Important?
Progression (and conversely, regression) is vital to the strength training program. This is because resistance training must utilize the Overload Principle (in conjunction with other training principles) by progressively applying stimuli to the body.
In other words, the goal of a strength training program is to gradually increase the stress placed on the body in order to create adaptation transferrable to sport.
By adapting to applied stressors, the body undergo changes that can positively impact sport, and these changes also help it to better tolerate the stimuli it is experiencing. This is actually the main function behind adaptation – the body morphs itself in order to become better suited to face the stressors being applied to it. As strength and conditioning coaches, we are simply trying to manipulate stress/stimuli in order to create adaptations that also benefit sport performance.
As the body adapts to these stressors, it becomes more efficient in handling them. Thus, we must gradually overload the body one way or another to continue seeing positive changes. This is progression at work.
This series will cover three means of progression in strength training:
Exercise/Movement Progression
As you or your athletes begin implementing strength training, exercise selection can immediately becomes a friend or foe.
If you choose movements with the appropriate difficulty level, you can expect safe improvements while you build movement competency. Choose inappropriate movements, and the athletes may not only stagnate, but they may get hurt as well.
Similarly, if you include adequate amounts of variety, you can expect compliance to the program. Include the wrong amount of variety, and the athletes may not only get bored and non-compliant, but they may again risk injury.
Thus, an exercise toolbox is a vital component of any program. But, how do we go about developing and focusing this exercise toolbox?
Step 1: Determine The Vital “Movement Categories” for Sport
For starters, you should determine what type of movements are important to include in your training program. There are probably tens of thousands of exercises for you to choose from. Rather than choosing exercises from this overwhelming list, start by narrowing down movement types, or “movements categories” that you deem important to your program.
When it comes to baseball, here are my chosen movement categories:
Anything outside of these categories will generally fall into either “Core” “Mobility” or “Auxiliary”
Step 2: Choose Your “Staple Movements”
With these five movement categories defined, you can then select your “staple movements” – or the movements that make up your standard training program. These are the exercises that your program will be built around.
I liken this process to a large skyscraper. The first floor of the building would be your staple movements. If an athlete has some training experience and possesses the competency to complete general strength training without limitations, then they are walking into the lobby of the first floor, which is where your staple movements reside. As they advance and progress, they will make their way up the elevator to higher levels. But, if the athlete isn’t quite ready for the standard level of your staple movement (aka the lobby), they can ride the elevator down into the basement of the building, where the regressions live.
An example of staple movements:
Ideally, every single athlete would walk into the “lobby” and be able to perform these movements adequately right away. But, this just isn’t the case with most. Many will need to regress by going “down the elevator,” while some may progress by going “up the elevator.”
Regardless, by determining which exercises will constitute your baseline “staple movements” you now have a small exercise toolbox to branch off of in both the direction of progression and regression.
Step 3: Determine a Path For Progression/Regression
Now that we have determined our five movement categories and five corresponding staple movements, we can make a line, tree, web – whatever you prefer – of progressions and regressions.
Movement/exercise progression and regression can be done by altering the stance, the implement (or loading pattern) utilized, or the complexity of the movement. For example:
Any combination of exercise progression can be utilized to alter the movement itself (intensity of movement and volume utilized are another story) and create a pathway for movement progression in the weight room. For example:
***Key: Staple Movement Regression Progression***
Bodyweight Squat <—> Goblet Squat <—> Barbell Front Squat <—> Barbell Back Squat <—> Barbell Squat Jumps
RDL Wall Drill <—> Plate RDL <—> Barbell RDL <—> Med Ball Caber Toss <—> Kettlebell Swing
Bodyweight Step-Up <—> Split Squat <—> Reverse Lunge <—> Forward Lunge <—> RFE Split Squat
High Plank Hold <—> Eccentric Push-Up <—> Push-Up <—> Dumbbell Floor Press <—> Dumbbell Press
Inverted Row (on High Angle) <—> Inverted Row (Feet on Floor) <—> Inverted Row (Feet-Elevated) <—> Single-Arm Dumbbell Row <—> TRX Row
With this roadmap in mind, an athlete now possesses a simple pathway to progress their exercises based on movement difficulty. Each line is based upon a vital movement category, with a staple exercise at the heart of each line, branching out in either direction – both toward progression and regression.
These lines can be as long as needed, or web out into many different directions. Only creativity, movement competency, and confidence can confine exercise selection.
***
Movement/exercise selection is just one of a handful of ways to progress an athlete through a training program. So long as the athlete or coach continues to safely apply the overload principle, the trainee should expect to experience enjoyment and success in the process of weight training.

A Pitcher's Long-Term Velocity Development: The Herbie Good Story - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-22T04:33:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/long-term-velocity-development-herbie-good/,"What follows is a deep look into the training history of Herbie Good, who built himself from a 15U player pulling down in the low-70s into a 19-year-old pitching at 91-93 T95.
In many respects, the story of Herbie mirrors Driveline’s own, and he has been a participant in the many iterations of throwing programs we have been testing since 2012.
Why did Herbie start training at Driveline? A coach told him to quit baseball.
At 15, Herbie was well on his way out of baseball. He was not a big, tooled-out prospect who was sure to grow into his velocity, given time.
He ran a 60-yard dash in 10 flat. Yes, 10.
This was the last push to acquire good baseball skills before I had to hang it up. Driveline was different than anything I had ever tried and I decided to give it a shot.
So, out of options and with the support of his family, Herbie started training.
From a training stand-point, Herbie had huge hurdles to overcome on the strength and coordination fronts. Tall athletes generally present coordination challenges. Doing Herbie’s initial assessment, the two most glaring issues were major general strength deficits and a throwing pattern that did not incorporate his lower half.
Herbie is proof positive that you do not need an “optimal” training program at a young training age. Herbie started in 2012. The Driveline Pitching Program looks significantly different than it did then.  In 2012, a significant portion of Herbie’s training included weighted ball holds, heavy bag work, 5+ days of heavy lifting and plenty of other drills and modalities that we have not found to be as effective as what we use today.
But the intent was always there. And that is what truly mattered.
What do I wish every 15-year-old in America knew about pitching? How to train and pitch with intent.
Below is a video of Herbie’s drill progressions over the last 4 years.
Over 5 years, Herbie trained at 3 different facilities, following us from place to place as our business grew. He trained on his own.
The reality is: our pitching program in 2016 is significantly better than it was in 2013. Yet, still Herbie was able to gain velocity over 26 weeks doing “non-optimized” programming. We wrote up his story (as unnamed athlete “Ezekial”).
Why? Because doing a “non-optimized” program at 100% effort will always trump the results generated by half-assing a “100%-optimized” program, if such a thing exists (it doesn’t).
Simultaneously, Herbie was working on improving the way that he moved. Below is a comparison of pivot pickoffs approximately 16 months apart.
Pivot Pickoffs: August, 2013
Pivot Pickoffs: February, 2014
Long-levered athletes have severe coordination issues (especially at a young age) that skill-specific overload training can help clean up.
Herbie absolutely killed pivot pickoffs in an attempt to improve and then internalize a natural arm path. It took 16-18 months to fully groove. And, to this day, still needs to be challenged in order to maintain it.
Such is the plight of being tall, young and uncoordinated.
Many coaches (and many athletes) do not have the ability to look at athlete development over that long of a time-frame.
Teams need to win now. Athletes want “easy”, “guaranteed” velocity.
For natural athletes who are high-responders to training, playing games, doing something on the training front, and letting physical maturity take care of itself can be a viable path to developing an athlete.
Non-athletes or athletes whose development curve has started to underperform their peers (i.e. you aren’t as good as you used to be) need a longer time horizon, less competition, and more focus on general and sport-specific training and fitness.
For many athletes, success is a number you’ve been dreaming about since you were a young kid watching big league games.
I first thought I could get drafted when I hit 90mph on a pulldown (at 16).
The letdown that happens after you reach that first milestone can create a letdown effect for athletes. Pulling down 90 MPH at 16 means that you are an elite thrower for your age, but it is not elite for the world population. Ultimately, to reach goals of playing baseball at the highest levels, you’ll need to be world-class.
What matters is how you respond to your first taste of success.
Athletes much more gifted than Herbie have come through our facility, hit 90mph (off the mound), gotten a 50% ride to a mid-major D1 school….and done nothing.
Once you hit a number, you always expect it will stick. But that simply isn’t true. The body is a complex system and, to make your velocity stick–let alone improve, you often have to abandon old training habits in search of new stimuli.
That is why environment matters.
Kyle continually encouraged me to keep throwing. So I did.
Who you surround yourself with matters. There is no better training environment than being the second- or third-best guy in the group. You always have a rabbit to chase. For 16-year-old Herbie, he had reached a goal, but had a group of guys in the early days of Driveline who were still better than he was.
He just had to keep working.
In Herbie’s case, doing this work was compounded by an injury.
Diving for a ball at first base, he hyperextended his arm and suffered an avulsion fracture in his pitching elbow and had to sit out his junior year of school.
He had surgery and started the rehab process. Playing catch early in that process was hard. He either had days where he felt great and wanted to throw harder than the prescribed effort, needing to be deliberately dialed back. Or had days where it was difficult to even pick up a ball.
For someone who had spent his last 18 months in the gym, training his heart out to play ball in college, sitting around was excruciating.
What did he learn from that experience?
Don’t take the ability to throw a baseball, or the ability to train for granted.
And while training intent is what got him to throwing 90mph in the first place, when he finished his rehab process, that intent was gone.
The most difficult part of the rehab process was being able to maximize intent again.
Again, environment played a large role. At 17, injured and nervous that you will ever get back what you had trained so hard to achieve, it is natural to back off wanting to protect yourself.
However, showing up to the facility every day, Herbie trained alongside older athletes with longer injury histories who served as both role models and rabbits to chase.
Plus, as the gym grew, more and more athletes were showing up. It wasn’t just Herbie, Kyle and a handful of the same athletes week after week.
New athletes meant more guys to compare himself too–and even more reason to keep pushing. His programming changed, focused less on maximal strength gains and more on coordination and speed.
Over the long-term, novelty in programming and environment plays a big role in facilitating adaptation in athletes.
And the intent did come back. Culminating in a 92-94mph indoor pen before draft day.
Herbie was drafted in the 36th round. And his story shows what can be accomplished by looking at athlete development over extremely long time periods.
To reach his next goal of playing professionally, Herbie still needs work. What he accomplished in 5 years is remarkable from mid-70s max effort running throw to 91-94 mph off the mound. But it isn’t the end.
Like he discovered at 16 when he threw 90mph, whether he reaches the next level as a pitcher is completely in his hands.
Way to go Herbie, Great story and I proud to admit that I really dig the circa 1991 John Daly mullet
What type of surface and drill was used to capture the mph each week? I.e flat ground, off mound…drill-pivot pickoff, rocker, walking wind up, run n gun?

"Baseball-Specific Training vs General Workouts: You Need Both, At Different Times - Driveline Baseball",2016-08-04T00:08:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/baseball-specific-training-general-physical-training/,"Post written by Ryan Faer, CSCS
Being new to the Driveline Baseball team and family, I think that it is important that I begin my first post by introducing myself to those who aren’t already familiar with my work as a strength and conditioning professional.
I’m going to side-step most of the formalities of this introduction; in all reality it doesn’t matter where I’ve been or what I’ve done in the past. What matters is what I am able to provide you in terms of knowledge and practical information. For that I’ll spare you of my bio, instead shifting my focus toward acquainting you with my baseball training philosophies and beliefs.
Over the course of many weekly blogs you’ll become privy to just about all of my thoughts on baseball strength and conditioning. These posts will be laden with specific and applicable information that can be utilized to help you in your training as soon as you close your web browser. It will also contain more visceral concepts related to strength and conditioning, concepts that will hopefully lay a strong foundation for you in your pursuit of athletic greatness – a pursuit that will undoubtedly require you to coach yourself quite often. Thus, knowledge and understanding of training – not just how’s, but the why’s – will be a primary objective of my blog posts.
With this post being my “inaugural” piece featured on Driveline, it will certainly be one of those more ideological discussions, as this topic is crucial to understanding my outlook on baseball performance training.
The goals of this discussion are to answer the following questions:
I like to view baseball-specificity through two contextual lenses:
Before talking about the training aspect, it is important that we have an understanding of what sport-specific adaptations are in terms of baseball.
Baseball-specific adaptations refer to the particular adaptations that the body undergoes in response to the physical stressors experienced during throwing and pitching. Similarly, baseball-specific adaptations also refer to any adaptations that must occur during training in order for safe pitching and throwing to occur during the season.
In other words, baseball-specific adaptations can occur as a result of training or as a result of pitching. These adaptations can be both positive and negative (this is a whole other discussion though).
For example: without the baseball-specific adaptation of scapular upward rotation on the dominant throwing arm, pitching safely and effectively during the season would be difficult, if not impossible. On the flip side, pitchers generally tend to adapt to the chronic repetitive stresses of pitching during the season by losing scapular upward rotation. A gain or loss of scapular upward rotation, in turn, is a baseball-specific adaptation that must be controlled for prior to and during the baseball season.
image from https://www.flexibilityrx.com/shoulder-mobility-and-scapular-stability/
Baseball-specific training, then, is any modality or method that aims to specifically manipulate the aforementioned baseball-specific adaptations. This isn’t just limited to mobility drills that, say, address the mobility demands of pitching (e.g. scapular upward rotation). High-level pitching also requires many other physical adaptations, such as lateral and rotational power, hip and thoracic spine mobility, as well as arm speed and proprioception. While these characteristics can be addressed through more general training (more below) they are best improved through specialized training that most closely resembles the act of pitching itself.  Throwing, whether with regulation baseballs, over- or under-weight baseballs, or medicine balls are some training methods that closely mimic the pitching motion itself, thus they are highly baseball–specific.
The requisites for optimal baseball performance, though, are not limited to sport-specific movements. General strength, global mobility, and other more general performance characteristics should be addressed as well. And, as I am sure that you understand intuitively, we can develop these more general qualities – qualities that are important for all sports, not just baseball – through general physical training methods.
For example: bilateral (two-legged) exercises are the most efficient means of enhancing maximal lower-body strength, as you can more effectively load the body with both legs are in a parallel stance (such as the squat and deadlift). While this isn’t “sport-specific”, I consider general physical training to be a vital component for improving all sport performance.
The delineation between baseball-specific and general training is important to understand for two reasons. Primarily, this is because specific and general training are interrelated. In fact, they are both on opposite ends of the general-specific training continuum.
As stated above, an attempt to develop lower-body strength by using, say, the bilateral squat (whatever variation: front, back, goblet, etc.) is considered general training. This is an integral part of the baseball performance training process.
But, why is it important?
We never throw or pitch from a parallel stance…
No, we don’t. But, the goal of general physical training is not to mimic the throwing motion. The goal of general physical training is to target general physical characteristics – characteristics that not only develop overall athleticism, but also help enhance the more baseball-specific outcomes.
This diagram should help explain this relationship more clearly:
Max and Relative Lower-Body Strength (General) → Lower-Body Power (General) → Lower-Body Power Directed Laterally/Rotationally (Specific) → Powerful Pitching (Specific)
Thus, if you want to attain optimal sport-specific adaptations (e.g. rotational throwing power) you must first develop the requisite lower-body strength, power, etc.
The second reason it is vital to understand the differences between general and specific training is that this understanding is needed to foster balance between the two ends of the training spectrum.
Training for baseball performance isn’t just about enhancing performance itself.  Injury reduction is also a key component (and a hot-button topic in its own right). To best address injury reduction, the pitcher must be able to “off-set” baseball-specific training and manage sport-specific adaptations.
In general, the off-season for a pitcher should move from general in nature to sport-specific over time.
The beginning of the off-season will contain more generalized training, not only to build the base of strength for subsequent specialized methods, but also to off-set an entire season of high throwing and pitching volumes, “maintenance” training in the weight room, and baseball-specific adaptations that have been accrued.
As the off-season progresses, power should become a larger focus, culminating with a pre-season period tailored more toward sport-specific power development.
Due in large part to the chronic nature of pitching stressors, as pitching volume ramps up at the start of the season, sport-specific training should be reduced, as not to overload the already-repetitive patterns experienced during pitching. Thus, generalized training becomes more of a focus (I should emphasize “focus” – it is the emphasis, but this does not come at the exclusion of all sport-specific training). This is the “off-set” we are talking about. The pitcher experiences plenty of lateral, rotational, minimally–loaded movements, thus training in the weight room doesn’t need to be focused on movements with similar characteristics.
The pendulum can swing easily from one side of the general-specific continuum toward the other over the course of the preparation and competitive seasons, year after year. But, it can also swing variably for different pitchers.
Kai Koch (12u Pitcher) still working towards 315lb squat.
For example, for the younger amateur pitcher (with a low training age) general physical training will most likely require greater attention. This is because, a) the young athlete generally does not have the overall strength necessary to take full advantage of more sport-specific training, b) the young pitcher generally has had much greater exposure to throwing than strength training, thus off-setting is necessary, and c) the young athlete has a greater window of adaptation for strength gains early in their training career, as the nervous system is primed for development – thus, they stand to gain much more on the field by just getting stronger in the weight room.
Conversely, the MLB veteran pitcher who has been training for some 10-15 years may not stand to see as great of gains from a program highly-focused on general-training, nor might they need as much general training. Thus, the pendulum may swing away from the general side of the continuum whenever “max strength” is supposed to be the focus. This is just a hypothetical example, not an absolute for all veteran pitchers.
Finally, consider an injury’s impact on the training process. If a pitcher sustains a mid-season injury and misses throwing/pitching for any length of time, they will undoubtedly fill that void with rehabilitation and general training.
But, before this pitcher sees the field upon recovery, they should see that their pendulum swings back toward the sport-specific aspect of the continuum, at least for a short time, in order to ensure adequate preparation for pitching performance and a safe return-to-play status (Driveline has a template for specific return-to-throwing work).
To wrap up, let’s briefly summarize the key concepts of this discussion by answering our initial questions:
Baseball-specific training addresses baseball-specific adaptations by
General physical training aims to enhance the capacity for sport-specific training by improving general physical characteristics such as strength, power, and global mobility, while also off-setting the chronic adaptations accrued from pitching.
In order to prepare for and maintain optimal pitching performance, pitchers should understand how to best balance the physiological sport-specific demands faced in baseball, the sport-specific adaptations necessary to safely perform at a high level, the general physical characteristics necessary to accentuate results from sport-specific training, and to best off-set accumulated baseball-specific adaptations.
***
Ultimately, high-level pitching performance cannot be attained nor sustained by exclusively focusing on either baseball-specific training or general training. The incorporation and appropriately shifted balance of both lends itself to safe and effective athletic development of the baseball pitcher.

"Are ""Safe"" Training Methods Causing More Injuries? - Driveline Baseball",2016-03-24T04:44:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/03/are-safe-baseball-training-methods-causing-more-injuries/,"I spoke a little bit about the consequences of safety from a baseball training side in a previous blog post, but there’s another side of this paradigm, which is a little counterintuitive – it’s possible that baseball training methods geared towards “safety” and “injury prevention” are indeed actually causing more injuries.
Vern Gambetta on the HMMR Media / GAIN Podcast had a few things to say about this phenomenon. When he was first getting into professional baseball in the 1980s, light dumbbell shoulder exercises like empty can raises and lateral raises were very popular, and still are today. They are colloquially known as “Jobe” exercises, named after Dr. Frank Jobe, the legendary orthopedic surgeon. Vern said:
Just doing injury prevention exercises… it’s not working, I don’t think… The first thing I saw everyone doing were “Jobe” exercises. We were able to prevent shoulder injuries by getting rid of the “Jobe” exercises… but the focus then became the kinetic chain, the shoulder is only one link in the kinetic chain…
Vern goes on to discuss how building a holistic and transparent program that has so-called “injury prevention” built into the programs and discusses why single-joint exercises and highly-specific light load exercises are indeed not that useful.
The podcast is a great listen, so I highly recommend checking it out at the above link. We’ll reference it a few more times in this article.
Later while Vern was working with an NBA team just a few years ago, he stated the entire roster went through a detailed evaluation about their athletic abilities:
Elaborate evaluation of each athlete… designed to find every deficiency of each athlete about what they could not do… they designed a remedial program but weren’t doing the normal strength program but were still expected to play. This team had the highest number of injuries in the NBA that year! This is ridiculous! They were never training for the game – they were doing low-demand type of work that was designed to address these perceived deficiencies tested in an isolated manner, not an integrated manner.
Inappropriate and too-early specific training to “fix” mechanical and athletic flaws in athletes when their raw output is so low is not only a waste of time, but potentially very injurious. By definition, an athlete with a low ability ceiling cannot meaningfully complete rehabilitation or highly-specific movement retraining modalities with any sort of effort or output that is effective at changing things. High-output constraint training using overload implements (wrist weights, Plyo Ball ®) create a much better bang for the athlete’s buck, developing not only mechanical efficiency but physiological improvement instead of targeting a faulty motor pattern and prescribing advanced exercises that are much better left to the elite athlete who can actually use the transfer properly.
Here’s a sample assessment of an athlete here using a few of the tools we have at our disposal.
Force Plate Analysis – Rocker Throw, 1000g PlyoCare® Ball
Shoulder IR Angular Velocity – Pitch off a Mound
The first graph is a Force Plate analysis of a Rocker Throw (constraint drill) to test the athlete’s ability to transfer force from the back leg to the front leg, block the force, and decelerate. The second graph is a true Biomechanical Analysis of the athlete throwing a max effort fastball off the mound while being filmed using multiple synchronized high-speed cameras, which is turned into a ton of kinematic parameters (shoulder IR angular velocity, elbow extension angular velocity, pelvic speed, hip rotation, torso flexion, etc) – this one happens to be Shoulder Internal Angular Velocity.
This is what shoulder internal rotation looks like, before we go too far off the rails:
Finally, two more markers we measure for this athlete:
The way we would address any flaws based on these readings is highly dependent on two MAJOR factors that are usually overlooked: Age of athlete and ability level of the athlete.
If the athlete in question had all those markers above and threw 75-78 MPH and was 15 years old, it would be highly inappropriate to design an advanced sport-specific program to shore up a bunch of deficiencies (poor lead leg blocking deceleration, faster-than-average external rotation angular velocity, poor ER/IR isometric strength balance), because your general program should be good at addressing these things! If your everyday work does not address these issues in the weight room, throwing program, and warm-up / recovery period, then your program is poorly designed. Now, if the athlete was a 23 year old professional pitcher who threw 93-96 MPH, you would trend further down the sport-specific ramp and work closely to eliminate flaws due to the high amount of energy inherent in the system despite the flaws present.
Mark Rippetoe (author of Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training, amongst other great books) discusses this at length on his website and his books. Rippetoe’s argument is that single-leg and increasingly specific “rehabilitation” exercises do not transfer well to the athletic and total movement required, since coordination and strength is inherently lower when the movement is further isolated.
Here’s an example chart of importance (y-axis) and time (x-axis) of an athlete’s training program at Driveline Baseball as measured by three outputs:
As time goes on and the athlete builds a better engine (ability), increasingly higher demands of sport-specific work is imposed on the athlete through ROM restriction and skill-specific work. The problem is when the graph is reversed or incorrectly aligned – doing more and more isolated and single-joint “rehab” work at low demands not only has poor transfer of training characteristics, but does not adequately prepare the athlete for competition.
A good pure ability development plan raises the floor and ceiling of the athlete’s ability and challenges them above their in-competition loads, ensuring that the game’s output is consistently lower than what they experience in the training room. It’s the logic and reason behind the phrase: “Game day should be your easiest day of the week” and why Ray Lewis said: “You pay me for Monday through Saturday. Sunday you get for free.”
Intermuscular coordination, multi-joint, and multiplane exercises are the best way to build the base of any training program – including any program that aims to reduce injury risk. The problem begins and is compounded when trainers and coaches get too fancy, too soon, and with too low output of athletes. One college baseball team’s pitching coach told me that nearly 100% of their athletes got hurt who had programs designed by a well-known “sports science” place! When I reviewed the training material, it was clear these programs were way too sport-specific and far too ballistic in nature – without enough general physical preparedness or raw strength – that when it came to game time and competition, they simply did not have enough underlying coordination and strength to handle the imposed demands, despite being really good at sport-specific movements. This is a real risk when you do not adjust your programming based on the athlete’s output level.
At the end of the day, trying to reduce injury risk by “assessing” and attacking it directly can often lead to worsening problems. Do not ignore general (GPP) before specific (SPP) work, and never neglect GPP maintenance in elite athletes. It’s a plane ticket to soft tissue injuries and severely hampered recovery markers.

Return to Throwing Program,2015-09-30T14:05:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/10/casey-weathers-the-importance-of-arm-health/,"The traditional model for phases of rehab that occur after Tommy John surgery look something like this:
This blog will focus on improvements that can be made in a return to throwing program.
ThiThis blog was updated on 6/3/2022 and was written by Dean Jackson and Kyle Lindley, edited by Michael O’Connell
Below is an example of what an Interval Throwing Program may look like.
It’s our opinion at Driveline Baseball that this type of program has three major flaws:
Let’s break them down:
Your first day throwing on this program involves two sets of “warm-up throws” and 50 total throws from 45 feet. If you split the difference on the warm-up throws and call it 15 throws each (10-20 per the document), then you are making 80 total throws on your first post-surgery throwing day!
The most common side effect of these types of programs involves soreness and setbacks due to the inability to overcome the volume of the program. This can create a vicious cycle of starting, stopping, and restarting a throwing program.
Our article detailing “pulldown” throws goes into a bit of detail, but players need to be tested at game-like intensities before they return to competition. We need to make sure that they are occurring at the appropriate time
Secondly, there is no monitoring outside of distance. Pitchers going out to 180 feet on this program do so at varying angles, velocities, and intent. Throwing at 40 mph or 60 mph at 60 feet should not be equal.
This program cannot be equally effective for the MLB pitcher who sits 95 MPH and the 17-year-old who sits 83 MPH. Other than different starting points, there are drastically different resources available to one over another.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also has its flaws as a measure of intensity.
Previous research has shown that the percentage of effort that a pitcher is trying to throw at does not correlate strongly with how hard the pitcher is throwing compared to their velocity peak (Slenker, Limpisvasti, et al. – Biomechanical comparison of the interval throwing program and baseball pitching: upper extremity loads in training and rehabilitation AJSM May 2014).
At 60% of perceived effort, pitchers were generating forces of 76% and ball speeds approaching 84% of maximum intensity.
Pitchers are really bad at estimating how much effort they are expending and consistently underestimate it. This should have profound implications for rehabilitation programs.
Programs are often written in a way that doesn’t account for the rest of a player’s life.
Some baseball players returning from surgery have a nice, smooth recovery process. Others do not. Some players’ bodies won’t let them progress for a few weeks. Other athletes feel incredible, and they feel ahead of schedule. It’s a rollercoaster to try and help a player along with  Physical Therapists and surgeons.
They are difficult to adjust in all areas because everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Because of this, there will often be some sort of setback due to throwing volume and intensity. After all, everyone will respond differently to a program. But we need to remember that other factors outside of the throwing program can also cause setbacks. Lack of sleep, varying nutrition, school load, or travel are a few reasons that can also cause setbacks.
The fact of the matter is tools exist today that can raise the standards of Tommy John rehab. We want a standardized approach but an individualized method.
The solution is to use technology to better track progress and make programs individualized. This means utilizing
Combined with subjective measures, these objective measures give us the best chance for the next revolution of rehab programs.
Using Pulse and a radar gun, we can monitor the following variables:
You can read more about the metrics on Pulse here.
We can use those to better supplement subjective measures by asking the athlete questions such as:
We can combine these to create the four main phases of our return to throwing program:
We can layer on more extensive monitoring with Pulse and Radar Gun inside these phases.
Arm Speed will be used as our primary monitoring tool until ~700 RPM Arm Speed. Reaching ~700 Arm Speed typically occurs after several weeks of throwing.
Once ~700 RPM arm speed is reached, we would switch to a combination of arm speed and throwing velocity. Arm speed and velocity would be used to continue progressing intensity through the remainder of the rehab. We choose ~700 RPM Arm Speed because that is approximately where Pulse Arm Speed starts to deviate from throwing velocity.
We would progress intensity using object data (arm speed and throwing velocity) and subjective data from that point on. Focusing on how he felt he was recovering, how his mechanics looked like his, and how his body responded well to the increased intensity.
The example below is from a return to throwing program with athlete Ryan Cloude. This example represents a sample of what can be done with a data-driven return to throwing program. The advice dispensed in this article would certainly not work for everyone for the reasons stated above. We know how weighted balls affect the torque on the arm and workload, the example program below only used baseballs.
Ryan Cloude is a 21-year-old collegiate pitcher. He has an interesting training history, having increased his pitching velocity from 83mph as a college freshman to topping at 95mph as a junior. In the middle of his junior season, he tore his UCL and required UCL reconstruction.
The goal of this phase was to build a throwing volume base at a low intensity. We start all our athletes off with a low threshold to set them up for increased intensity later.
Ryan threw 3x per week during this 4-week phase. We monitored Arm Speed with Pulse, gradually increasing from a one-session average of ~200 RPM and top 1/8th ~250 RPM to a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM.
Total throws per session increased from 25 to 90 from the beginning to the last day of the phase.
We built this phase of the throwing volume base established in Phase 1 by increasing the throwing intensity on Monday and Friday each week.
Once Ryan hit the ~700 RPM arm speed mark, we switched measuring intensity from Arm Speed to throwing velocity.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM to a one-session average of ~600 RPM and top 1/8th ~850 RPM. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 49.9 mph and top 1/8th 57.6 mph to a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th 76.0 mph.
Instead of throw counts, Ryan was given options between 60-90 throws on the higher intensity days. At the same time, lower intensity days progressed gradually from 90 to 120 throws. He did the max number of throws most days, except for three days where the daily notes had some variation of “another crazy conditioning at 6 am this morning, body felt dead. Stopped at 60 throws”—no arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
One week, the same intensity was repeated (instead of progressing it) because Ryan was exhausted from team conditioning and didn’t want to push it.
Return to throwing templates lack guidelines on how to make adjustments to the program. At times the adjustment doesn’t need to be because something went wrong with the throwing program. But other parts of a player’s life are still ongoing when rehabbing a throwing injury. Tracking these programs leaves a player and a coach in a much better place to make an appropriate adjustment.
The only difference between the schedule of this phase and the last is that instead of the weeks going HLH, HLH (higher intensity, low, higher, and repeat), they went HLH, LHL (higher intensity, low, repeat). This shifted Ryan from 4 higher intensity throwing days every two weeks to 3 high-intensity throwing days every two weeks.
There were two new additions in phase three. First, bullpens at lower intensity began in this phase. Second, we started to focus more on moving efficiently. We measure movement efficiency by throwing the prescribed velocity with the lowest possible arm speed.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~600 and top 1/8th of ~850 to a one-session average of ~700 and top 1/8th of ~ 925. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th of 76.0 mph to a one-session average of 69.6 mph and top 1/8th of 89.4 mph.
His volume options remained 60-90 on higher intensity days and 90-120 on lower intensity days. Ryan decided not to throw the max amount of throws on a given day: total body soreness from training with his team and getting kicked out of the gym as it was closing. No arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
Bullpen throwing velocity was dropped back to the high 70s, with two pens being thrown each week, and lower intensity days were added over a couple of weeks until Ryan was throwing five days a week.
Throwing velocity on main bullpen days gradually increased from a one-session average of 64.5 mph and top 1/8th of 77.4 mph to a one-session average of 74.2 and top 1/8th 90.9 mph.
We had phases that we wanted to progress through and a good idea how roughly how much we should progress over a certain period, but ultimately we let Ryan’s body decide if it was ready to progress or not.
If the prescribed intensity for a session wasn’t comfortable, we would not progress intensity in the next session (regardless of what the program template said). We would repeat the intensity (or reduce it) until it was comfortable. The main idea in the intensity prescribing process was “letting the door be opened” when Ryan’s body was ready and not trying to “kick the door down” and force a more intense stimulus on his arm before it was ready.
Other pitch types were added first to recovery days during this phase. Simply by throwing offspeed in flat ground or catch play/long toss work. Intensity and volume were gradually increased until Ryan was throwing at maximum intensity on the mound.
Volume options for total throws on each bullpen day gradually increased from 60-90 to 90-110, while volume options for lower intensity days stayed 90-120. Once Ryan’s velocity got back into the high 80’s a few bullpens turned into recovery days because he didn’t feel fully recovered.
The first live session versus hitters happened roughly 10.5 months post-op and went well enough that Ryan decided he was ready to face hitters in a game that counted for his team. The first outing versus hitters in a real game happened just before the 11-month post-op mark and resulted in 1IP 0H 0BB 3K.
After completing his return to play, Ryan reflected on the process as a whole:
“Having objective data to show my progress was massive for my mental state. On days where I wasn’t able to hit my goal or days where I felt I was so far away from being healthy, I’d be able to look back and see how much harder I was throwing and how much more arm speed I was able to handle.”
It’s widespread to hear athletes talk about the mental toll injuries took on them and how grueling the whole experience is. I believe collecting data to give athletes a good idea of where they are now, where they have been, and where they need to go can significantly improve how comfortable their experience with rehab ends up being.
Ryan also said:
“(I) loved having a progression based on how I was recovering and not a cookie-cutter program that’s the same for everyone.”
We’re attacking it via our integrated staff training methods, technology, and Driveline TRAQ – and results have never been better, both on the performance AND rehab sides.

Uncommitted to Drafted: Christian Meister's Year of Training,2015-09-05T10:13:43+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/09/uncommitted-to-drafted-christian-meisters-year-pitching-training/,"Summary
In the 2015 MLB Draft, Christian Meister was drafted in the 29th round out of “No School.” He was signed because he showcased good velocity with command despite graduating from a junior college and not having a team to play for during the 2015 season.
During his pitching training at Driveline, Meister increased his mound velocity from 87 mph to 92-93 mph, hitting 95 mph, and improved his command of all pitches.  Meister’s story provides insight into building a foundation for elite pitching velocity and command, starting with the most important tool of all: learning how to work.
Christian Signs His Contract along with Kyle and Matt
Getting Started: An Uninspired Approach
When he started with us at Driveline, he’d just seen his aspirations of playing college baseball go up in smoke.  He wanted to play in the majors, and the standard path – junior college to college program to drafted – was seemingly closed to him.
“I had nothing to lose.  That was my mentality.  Everything to gain, nothing to lose.  I saw the results from other guys – they spoke for themselves.  I thought – why not me?”
Meister recounts his first experience with Driveline, after being introduced to us through his friend and teammate.
“I was interested.  I’d heard about weighted ball programs in the past, and I’m always looking to get better.  I really liked what they were about, and I trained there for a couple weeks without anything formal.  I decided to stick with it and go there full-time – I knew that where I was at wasn’t where I wanted to be.”
Still, even with that decision in mind, Christian’s training intensity was inconsistent and both trainers and athletes noticed a curious propensity to skip throwing recovery and high utilization rate of the Smith machine for lifting.
Learning to Work: How Mindset and Environment Impact Training Results
As the summer and fall turned to winter and Christian still was without a school to play for in 2015, he made the mental shift to fully commit to the program.
“For the first couple months, I was kind of blindly doing things, and then I started to see that if I was going to do it, I needed to do it 100% every day.  I saw other guys, how hard they were working – one of the guys that I worked with was Casey Weathers, who’s in AA for the Indians, and I worked with him for six months.  He’s an older guy, and he’s probably one of the hardest workers I’ve ever seen in my life.  Every day, in all aspects – weighted baseballs, lifting – he’s extremely strong and fit.  It’s cool to have a guy that can push you like that.  Like, I’m throwing 5 oz. baseballs as hard as he’s throwing 7 oz. baseballs.  It makes me want to get better.  That was a great training tool to have.”
Casey and Christian throwing weighted balls (Oct ’14). He barely scrapes 96 mph and it’s a good day. In February, he will have a day where no ball is under 96 mph and be upset about it.
Those trainees, and the environment they create, are essential.  For a significant time during Meister’s training with us, he did the workouts, but was not fully invested mentally.  It was a shift that the training staff noticed.
“He knew what to do, but he hadn’t committed his heart to executing it.
“Sometime during the fall, Ben Brewster [now with the White Sox organization], an intern with us at the time, took Meister aside and showed him how to lift – not just the mechanics of it, but the mentality, and the importance of following through on recovery.  Brewster held him accountable for his training – and that kind of accountability can be everything.”
-Mike
“Our athletes are some of the best teachers we have. Who am I to say ‘show up five days a week?’  He’s employing me.  If you pay someone to yell at you, eventually you’ll see it’s ridiculous because you have the power to make them stop.  To me, it has to come from peer pressure.  That’s why we’re protective of who we have.”
-Kyle
It’s this culture that is the most important part of our facility.  Meister being around professional pitchers who would hold him accountable for his own training is what makes a good working environment.
Getting to the Next Level: Training at 100% when you have 80% to give
Meister saw immediate gains from the training, but, inevitably, he hit a plateau.
“It’s different for everyone.  It depends on your mechanics, work ethic, natural ability.  I saw a pretty quick jump initially, [but] there are ups and downs, too.  The guys at Driveline, they’re very in tune with that.  They’ve seen it before.  No one goes straight up.  I think it speaks to baseball, really.  It’s a game of failure, and how you deal with that. It’s not about the week to week gains as much as it is the overall, ‘where I’m going to be in six months, a year.’”
After the mindset switch. Not all days are great days. But there is a major cumulative training effect.
The velocity charts for Meister tell this tale in remarkable clarity.  You can almost draw a line, in the fall, where he just decided ‘I’m going to do this’, where he legitimately taught himself how to work hard.  But without that commitment, there’s no way he gets drafted.
Once that mentality shift happened, Meister started facing a new challenge: the fact that training at that level means you’re rarely working with a full tank of gas.
“Plenty of times my arm wasn’t feeling good, but you have to go with as much effort as you can.  One of the terms we use – ‘if you’ve only got 80% today, give 100% of it.’  Making sure you’re always going as hard as you can, regardless of how much you’ve got that particular day.  It’s always going to be different.  You’re rarely at 100%.”

Sustaining High Output for the Long Run: Training as an Identity
And, expanding on that, Meister had a takeaway of his own from his experience at Driveline:
“What it means to put in damn near close to 100% every day for a long period of time.  Growing up a little bit.  It was huge.  Obviously physical development, but mental as well.  You’re not always going to have your best stuff, and how you deal with it, how you prepare, that’s huge.”
Preparation is an important word for us to highlight, here.  Both because it was the missing element before Meister committed to the program (he would often do workouts, but skip recovery) and because it was a huge mental edge to have once he did.
“When I know that I’ve prepared the best I can, there’s no doubt in my mind when I go out there.  When I step on that mound, I know that I didn’t leave anything to doubt.  There’s no regrets.  I think it’s a huge mental edge to have.  Then you just attack, and you can feel good at the end of the day regardless of the results, and if you’ve worked hard usually the results will be in your favor.”
Meister had his own take on his biggest lesson from his time at Driveline:
“The work ethic, learning how to work.  Dealing with how I’m feeling – how my arm’s feeling – on a day-to-day basis.  That’s the nice thing about being in the Indians organization.  They’re the most progressive as far as pitchers and throwing programs.  We’re allowed to long toss, we’re allowed to do whatever it is we need to do that makes us successful.   That’s key for me, because I came from Driveline, which is a unique program – most of the other organizations I wouldn’t be able to do that, to continue it.  That’s huge.”
Work ethic, in our minds, doesn’t simply equate to doing hard work.  It’s a phrase that’s hard to pin down, but, as evidenced by Meister’s development, it can sometimes just be as simple as showing up.  “If training is work to you, you shouldn’t do it,” says Boddy.  “So much of professional baseball is harder than that.  If the preparation isn’t your passion, then it’s not really your thing.  Work ethic is the ability to work at a menial job and then show up at Driveline with the correct attitude.”
What Lies Ahead: One Goal Down, One Very Far Away
While Christian has achieved one goal, he is still very far away from his primary one: pitching in the Major Leagues. While he has learned what it takes, that doesn’t mean that he will have what it takes. But continuous improvement can help him build upon this success.
The kind of preparation Meister talked about, the kind of intense, focused effort that can consume one’s day-to-day life, seemingly leaves little room for the big picture.  But, as Meister points out, having a long-term goal is essential.  And having that goal doesn’t have to be a distraction.
“Absolutely.  One of my philosophies of life is to have a long-term goal, a big goal, and then set a bunch of short-term goals and then check those off.  The ultimate goal is to make it to the big leagues and stay there.  Short term, continue to train, get better every single day.  It’s as simple as that.  If you take care of the little things, then the big thing is going to take care of itself.”
In the end, Meister’s passion for the game shone through – and it’s not a coincidence.
“You have to do so many things in life that you don’t like. If baseball is one of them, don’t do it.”

How to Pitch Faster: Using Rotational Lateral Bounds to Improve Pelvic Loading - Driveline Baseball,2015-02-02T11:23:04+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/02/rotational-lateral-bounds-improve-pelvic-loading-build-elite-velocity/,"The lateral bound, also called the lateral skater jump or lateral heiden (named after former Olympic speed skater Eric Heiden) is a fantastic frontal plane lower body exercise. It gets athletes out of constantly training in the sagittal plane, and has shown a high correlation to ball velocity when compared to other measures of lower body strength and power, such as medball scoop and squat tosses, unilateral and bilateral vertical jumps, single / triple broad jumps and 10 / 60 yd sprint times (Lehman et al., 2013).
However, we know that pitching is a motor pattern that relies on not just drive leg hip abduction, and hip/knee flexion/extension, but also a significant rotational component as well. The traditional lateral bound only trains the leg musculature in the sagittal and frontal planes, neglecting the transverse (rotational) component.
Furthermore, many young athletes have never fully understood what the pelvic loading/unloading process feels like when attempting to throw faster. Many mistakenly think that it is a purely frontal plane “push” when the reality is that high level throwers create torque via their hip rotator muscles, holding this tension as they drive towards the target, before releasing it into a late, smooth and powerful opening of the hips into landing.
Let’s take a look at the traditional lateral bound (pause the video and hold down on the video buffering bar to scroll frame by frame)
Here is the rotational lateral bound, which involves creating a torque at the hip joint (i.e. pelvic loading) followed by an explosive unloading of this tension (i.e. pelvic unloading). Whereas the countermovement in the lateral bound is a drop into knee/hip flexion and hip adduction (followed by the opposing movements – extension and abduction), the countermovement in this exercise is a combination of those same factors, but also adding in a stretch of the hip rotators, which drives the hip unloading process, crucial to converting linear back leg drive into usable rotational kinetic energy and for achieving a biomechanically efficient position at landing (front leg braced, hips open, back foot turned down and over).
And finally a standard throw with a Plyo Ball ® (note the similarities in the lower half, even at just a 30% throw)
For comparison, let’s check out a couple hard-throwing big leaguers….
Notice how the back leg drives into aggressive hip abduction and hip extension, while HOLDING this hip internally rotated “knee pinched” position. An indication that this process is occurring properly is when the back foot begins to invert, with the majority of the pitcher’s bodyweight being held on the inside (medial) portion of the back foot. The center of mass begins to move directly towards the target while the upper body stays back and shoulders stay closed.
In addition to Aroldis Chapman, Sandy Koufax is one of the most obvious examples of this pelvic loading, holding a ton of internal rotation torque in his back hip joint as he drives his center of mass towards the plate (via hip abduction and extension), keeping his upper body back and shoulders closed. Watch 0:45 in the following clip to see what this looks like.
Sandy Koufax – creating an internal rotation torque at the back hip
Putting it all together
Maxing out the contribution of your lower half to your throwing motion is complex, but the fundamental principles are relatively simple – 1) learn to apply more force into the ground, 2) learn to apply that force in the right direction and 3) learn to sequence the segments properly and with good timing in order to facilitate maximum transfer of this energy into the later links of the kinetic chain.
Applying more force into the ground
Applying force in the right direction
Learning to sequence the segments with good timing
You now have some tools and information at your disposal to start developing elite lower body mechanics. Keep in mind that effective lower body mechanics are just one piece of a well-synced throwing motion that produces high velocities safely.

What about the deceleration of the hips in the kinetic chain at impact? Isn’t that an important part of the transfer of energy to the torso and shoulders?
To clarify my question. As weight is transfered to the front foot, the linear velocity of the hips decelerates. Then then there is peaking of the hip rotational velocity, but this happens before ball release, or ball impact with a bat. The hips are decelerating as the shoulder rotation is increasing. Looking at the above videos the hip rotation almost comes to a complete stop at release, then the momentum of the shoulder and arm deceleration after ball release causes the hips to be dragged around for further rotation. The rotation of the hips is not a one continuous motion, but two separate ones.
Kyle, what are your thoughts on Lanz Wheeler and the Core Velocity Belt? According to what I can understand from what I’ve read about this Core Velocity Belt “Teaches Pitchers & Hitters What It FEELS Like To Build An Explosive Lower Half & Takes
I’m confused. Are you saying that as you drive, your drive leg is supposed to be rotated IN as you are going to the plate? That’s what it looks like with the still photos of Bauer, Chapman, Kofax. Check this link. https://a.espncdn.com//photo/2015/0208/mlb_u_dunn_300x200.jpg It’s a photo of Mike Dunn of the Marlins. His back leg doesn’t seem rotated in at all. I’m confused which one is best? He throws exceptionally hard as well, mid to high 9’s.
[…] Instead of training for a sport specific skill that isn’t used everyday, such as a vertical jump, your weight training program should be focused on covering all three planes of motion. And if your scratching your head for ideas on how to do so, you’re in luck. We’ve talked about ways that you can train in the frontal and transverse plane before. […]

Velocity Training: Perfecting the Overhead Medball Throw - Driveline Baseball,2014-12-10T08:02:25+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/12/velocity-training-perfecting-overhead-medball-throw/,"Plyometric training is a key component to developing explosive power that can be applied to the throwing motion. This revelation is nothing new – coaches have been using medicine ball drills for years, but a vast majority of athletes miss the boat when it comes to performing these movements properly, losing out on some of the biggest benefits of these exercises. Not only that, many athletes have no clue how to progress medicine ball throws once they have mastered the basics – do you add weight? Do more reps? Let’s cut through the crap and make you an expert on one of the most effective medball drills for pitchers that you’ve probably been doing wrong:
What We Know:
Elite velocity requires athletes being comfortable not just getting into positions that test the end range of their mobility, but rapidly generating force from these positions.
Enter the overhead medball throw:
This overhead medball progression is not a substitute for actual skill practice, but it will help teach basic weight shift, full extension of the rear leg and torso at release, along with training the throwing specific musculature in coordinated and ballistic fashion.
–A properly performed medball throw does these 3 things–
Progression #1: Static Split Stance Slam
Start in split stance with weight on back leg and arms fully extended overhead. Drive from the hips and finish out front.
Progression #2: Rock Back Slams
Start with ball extended out in front, rock back to rear leg and accelerate ball from the ground up.
Progression #3: Walk-Into Slams
Start with stride leg forward, step into throw while keeping upper body sequencing.
Progression #4: Run and Guns
Description: 10-15 foot run up, maintaining proper sequencing and explosiveness.
What not to do:
Want to learn more about strength training as it relates to being a better pitcher? Read all of our articles relating to strength here.
Any tips about the type of med ball best suited for this drill? I’m thinking bouncy vs non-bouncy. Seems like you have a bouncy one in those vids.
Also, in the various plyo drills its common to use different weights to provide a different feel. Good idea here? A few with a 2kg, a few with a 1kg, and so on.
I’d recommend non-bouncy if possible. It minimizes risk of wearing one off of a bad rebound. Definitely a good idea to vary the weights, within reason (between 1 and 3kg most likely).
That’s the ratio Kyle seems to favor with plyos in a given set; 1:2.
How reps and sets should you do for each progression and how many times a week to get the maximum out of this workout?

Demonizing Early Specialization - Flawed Research Interpretation - Driveline Baseball,2014-11-18T11:35:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/11/demonizing-early-specialization-flawed-research-interpretation/,"A generally-accepted tenet of youth sports training is to avoid early specialization – meaning that kids should have more unstructured play time and not get locked into a single sport at an early age. Trainers and pundits around the world have embraced this concept, demonizing parents and  coaches who suggest that single-sport specialization might be a reasonable decision. Just take the Google search engine for a spin and see it for yourself.
Unfortunately, these claims, while well-meaning, have little to no basis in actual sports science research. Here are the two most common claims used in the case against early specialization:
This argument is made by many trainers, and Elsbeth Vainbo is just one example of many. (I have no particular ill-will towards her; this article is just often cited by other writers.) In Does Early Specialization Help?, Elsbeth makes the following point:
Do the best of the best get there by playing only one sport? Or do they develop athleticism across multiple sports? I decided to run a little test: I took lists of the top 10 players in 2012 from the four major team sports in North America, and let Google help me to see what sports were in each of their backgrounds. For the sake of consistency, I went with lists compiled by ESPN. You may not agree with their list, but I felt it was best to go with a single source for top 10 lists for the NBA, NFL, MLB, and the NHL; and ESPN seemed the best option.
…
Would you believe me if I told you 7 out of 40? Only 18% of the top professional athletes were single-sport athletes. Or to look at it another way, 82% played multiple sports.
This is a pretty clearly fallacious argument for multiple reasons, but the best one is simply this: More athletes play multiple sports than those who play a single sport. No attempt to control for youth participation across sports was done, so this simple argument should be thrown out. It seems to make sense on the surface, but what if 90% of ALL youth athletes played multiple sports growing up? Would 7/40 be a good argument then? Clearly not.
Elsbeth also goes on to talk about the idea that early specialization may be harmful, but quotes no research, merely anecdotal stories. We’ll look to others for this.
The vast majority of studies that link single-sport specialization to increased injury risk did not control for number of games played or seasons participated in. In fact, what “early specialization” meant to these researchers was increased games played and participated in by an athlete – year-round soccer, baseball, basketball, and so forth. Instead of playing 20 games of basketball, 20 games of baseball, and 20 matches of swimming, an example athlete would play 60 games of basketball instead.
I have zero qualms with this claim and it’s almost certainly true that participating in increased competitive games in a single sport year-round leads to increased injury risk. The same holds true for baseball – perhaps especially so, considering pitching off a mound at a young age is a very risky activity and should be limited by pitches, innings, and months on the diamond.
However, this is NOT the same as talking about early specialization while LIMITING competitive participation! Consider the example youth athlete that plays 20 games of baseball and loves the game so much that he trains year-round for baseball in an appropriate way that does not risk the growth plates and connective tissue. Would the results be the same? A big league pitcher that works with me specialized in baseball at 12 years old but his father kept him out of competitive leagues for much of the year, having him take lessons with a local pitching coach and throwing long toss and doing drills during the week. He played no more competitive games of baseball than the average multi-sport athlete, but got significantly better through additional exposure and repetition of sport-specific drills. He went on to get a full scholarship at a college, get drafted in the first round, and pitch in the big leagues just a few years later.
No attempt to control for these cases was done, and equating additional games played with the fault of a single sport is the incorrect conclusion to draw.
Let me make it clear, lest I be misquoted: I do NOT believe that youth athletes should play competitive games year-round. However, forcing a youth athlete to play multiple sports when all he wants to do is play baseball simply because you heard it was a good idea from “research posts on the Internet” has no basis in reality. Youth athletes should be held out of competition for an appropriate amount of time per year, but off-season training can be provided to confer both general fitness and sport-specific fitness without increasing the injury rate to the athlete.
Demonizing parents whose kids want to play one sport is not fair and has little to no real support when it comes to peer-reviewed research. Unfortunately, much of the research out there has significant holes in it and journalists take the conclusions in the wrong direction, fitting the “research” to their predefined narrative.

Bingo. 11U son’s competitive season ended in the 2nd week of July. After many months of practice, house league play + 8 travel tournaments and district LL action we were all ready for a break: son, mom & dad and the dog too.
6 days later my son is horsing around with neighborhood friends in pickup games in backyards and when school starts I have to drag him away from watching the fall ball games his friends are playing so he can concentrate on school work. Its in his blood.
I would argue that 33 out of 40 PROFESSIONAL athletes were so athletic compared to their childhood peers that they were able to simply bounce from season to season without needing to specialize because they were such great athletes!  When people use this argument against specialization I want to ask them if they have ever coached a kid who was a professional athlete during that players childhood.  While I have yet to have that happen, I have coached kids who are headed to play college athletics and in every single case where I coached them in in more than one sport, they were the best player on the team, not because of specialization but simply due to athleticism.
Imagine the level of athleticism of someone who plays professional sports.  This entire debate is like unto a straw-man argument in politics.  This notion that the most elite athletes who play professional sports, play professional sports because they didn’t specialize at a young age.  In every situation where I read this type of “research” I always feel like the author is either being disingenuous or ignorant of the role of athleticism in youth to pro.  I have yet to read anything written where the premise of specialization being at the core of everything that is wrong with youth sports where I agreed.
I think you make a good point about the distinction between competing in sport and training for it – two different things. The problem in my eyes, however, lies in the fact that training year round for only one sport often does not follow an LTAD model. Exposing children to different sports and hitting the appropriate windows of optimal trainability is an important component to developing an athlete with a broad spectrum of movement competency, strategy and skill. I think you were conveying this idea when you said you can confer general and sport specific training in the off-season, but I am not sure that it is as widely understood in the general population. Any thoughts on implementing LTAD models into a baseball only development program?
What 12, 13, or 14 year old kid wants to play 20 games a year, and leave the rest of the year to training? They will get bored and frustrated. Playing Other sports are the mark of a well rounded athlete and can enhance the speed, strength, quickness, reaction, and general competitiveness of an athlete. How boring would our lives be if kids specialized at a young age? How many kids stop growing at 12 or 13? How many kids were better than others at certain sports because of their size? Lots of kids think Baseball is the greatest sport ever and they want to be a pro player when they are 12, but what if they have never played football, soccer, basketball, etc? No knows their best sport at 12. And the fact is the vast majority of kids want to be playing a sport throughout the year and it is parents and specialized coaches that want them to play year round. I know, I deal with it every day all year round. Kids’ excuse for specializing is they are worried about injury from another sport or not being good enough to play collegiate. 12-15 year kids don’t think like that. They want to be with their friends and compete. When they divide to quit a sport they do well in at they age, they generally are being pressured to do so by an adult. And it’s hard to blame the parent when they are spending thousands a year to specialize in what ever sport. When you do that you force the kids into an early decision. If a kid only played 20-30 games a year I would agree they don’t get burned out or injured, but most don’t. And still, you’re restricting the fun and opportunities in their life. A real athlete with compete. I talked to Jared Weaver 4 months ago and he said his baseball coach when he was 14 tried to get him to quite basketball and go straight baseball saying that’s what he needed to play next level. Jared said no. Not everyone is Jared Weaver, but most will not go professional or D1. These kids need to play multiple sports to get a better experience overall.
Hey Cullen, thanks for posting your viewpoint on this. We do agree with you that playing multiple sports can be a great experience for young athletes. We encourage most of our youth athletes to play other sports. This article is just pointing out that if an athlete decides to specialize at a young age, with guidance from his/her parents, that neither the athlete nor the parents should be ridiculed for it. Taking time away from playing games, to train strength and athleticism allows the athlete to set the cornerstones for future growth. This will be what they build off of for the rest of their careers. We also believe you don’t have to stop competing just because you are not playing in games. If you are tracking your workouts, you get to try to beat previous numbers while also seeing your improvement. We find that athletes at all levels really enjoy this kind of training environment, where they can compete with themselves and their peers. You can look at the baseball season as a test. In school, you wouldn’t test everyday. You would build up to the test with teachings and studying. Training is just that, leading up to the test, or season. For a quick look at how we train youth pitchers, check out this short article.

Post-Activation Potentiation with Weighted Baseballs,2014-09-29T12:51:35+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/09/post-activation-potentiation-weighted-baseballs/,"Post-Activation Potentiation (PAP) is a controversial topic in exercise science, with research pointing in favor and against it working. PAP is not easy to describe, but the simplest way to put it is to think about testing your 60-yd dash time shortly after squatting 3-5 reps of heavy weight. The idea is that by “potentiating” the central nervous system (CNS) using heavy movements, performance increases in subsequent lighter and explosive movements.
First and foremost, it’s important to note that the most popular method of PAP in baseball does NOT work – using a donut or weighted bat sleeve in the on-deck circle before going up to hit.
Dr. Coop DeRenne, a legend in the world of baseball performance science, studied this very phenomenon years ago. Donuts used prior to swinging a real bat show a marked decrease in bat speed, yet hitters use them all the time. The reason for this isn’t because athletes are smarter or more experienced than sports scientists running controlled experiments, of course, it’s just a mix of inertia, superstition, and fear.
Or you could ask the scholarly people in the comments of major news sites, who have stunning results to share with us all:
Thanks, Doctor.
The reason that PAP doesn’t work in the on-deck circle is because the use of the donut in an attempt to increase the bat weight makes no effort to grasp the significantly changed biomechanics of the swing by adding 200% or more of the weight to the bat in an uneven distribution. This makes the loaded donut swing a completely different motor pattern by drastically changing not only the mass of the bat, but the moment of inertia (MOI) of the bat as well.
In short, it doesn’t work. So if you use donuts in the on-deck circle (or at all, really), you should stop.
Ah, this is the million dollar question, isn’t it? What about throwing weighted baseballs prior to pitching to potentiate the CNS to increase output?
I think this is a rather fascinating concept, and as it so happens, we’ve studied this effect as best we can in the Driveline Sports Science lab. There are three generally-accepted methods of how PAP works, and the primary one we focused on was the idea that increased recruitment of higher order motor units would activate other motor units to allow for greater than average neuromuscular performance.
Study
Have athletes test run-and-gun velocities with a standard (5 oz) ball after a dynamic warm-up, then throw 6 oz and 7 oz overload balls for 3-5 reps each. After that, test run-and-gun velocities with the standard (5 oz) ball again and see if there are significant changes.
We also tested the OPPOSITE effect – we had athletes throw underload baseballs instead of overload to see if activation might work in a different manner.
Results
We split the athletes into two even groups as randomly as possible while controlling for age and skill level.
First we’ll discuss the underload group: It was a disaster. Subjectively the athletes overwhelmingly hated it when feedback was solicited, and objectively the data was clear as day – velocities went directly into the tank by 2+ standard deviations.
Some things said:
Pretty clear loser there. We moved underload balls back to where they’ve always been – at the end of the velocity run-and-gun tests.
The overload group, on the other hand, had mixed but statistically insignificant results. No athletes complained about the grouping of the weighted ball throws (5-6-7-5-4-3 oz) and while the average of the group saw higher velocities, it wasn’t statistically significant – and some lost velocity after throwing the overload baseballs. Some statistically insignificant trends that seemed worthy of future study were found, however:
Overall, I think the idea of PAP is very interesting and perhaps useful when it comes to weighted baseballs, but perhaps not prior to a game. Our study was a very limited trial that did not test one of the most important variables in a game – endurance.
It’s very possible that a comprehensive dynamic warm-up using proper tools captures enough of the “PAP” benefits, and athletes who do not warm-up and potentiate the CNS correctly prior to training or competing may see phantom benefits from what they think is truly PAP.
In that vein, however, we recommend all athletes use Plyo Ball ® to warm-up alongside their dynamic warm-up that should feature resistance bands, foam rollers, and other techniques to properly prepare the body and mind for competing on the diamond.
Yup, my son wanted to be like everyone else and use a donut. I didn’t let him.
But there was that one study that showed a significant positive effect for female softballers. Don’t know if it was ever replicated.
I don’t get this:
“……idea of PAP is very interesting and perhaps useful when it comes to weighted baseballs, but perhaps not prior to a game.”
Then:
“we recommend all athletes use PlyoCare balls ….. to properly prepare the body and mind for competing on the diamond.”
Plyos are weighted balls too. I don’t get the distinction being made here.
We split the distinction between PlyoCare balls and Driveline Elite Weighted Balls (which I refer to as “weighted balls”). Sorry for the confusion
Which means you’ve tested plyos as an effective warmup for throwing from the bump. I saw your tweet pics showing them in your own adult league throwing. Will this be covered in the upcoming book? Did Beav pitchers do this last season?
Yes, though my warm-up with PlyoCare balls is for a different reason. I have a partial thickness tear in my infraspinatus (and likely serious fraying in the supraspinatus), and I use them to activate my posterior shoulder. I’ll do upwards of 40-65 reps (split across 4-6 sets) of external rotation tosses into the air with the 1kg PlyoCare ball prior to picking up a baseball. Usually I do them after foam rolling, LAX ball rollouts, resistance band work, and arm oscillation work (I carry a Total Bar with me since it’s a little more portable than a Shoulder Tube).
It’ll be covered in the upcoming book for sure. Beaver pitchers did not use PlyoCare balls in warm-ups much, or at least it was not prescribed (some may have individually). This year may be different.
Hi Kyle, in regards to what you posted, “weighted ball throws (5-6-7-5-4-3 oz)” is this also in the same order when you guys do regular velo work? Or was this just the order for the study?
Thank you
Just for the study. This sequence also appears in our free weighted baseball eBook, available under “Our Books” in the top nav bar.
I looked in the eBook. What page is it on because the order looks different?
Just as a side note… While training swings (not hitting or barrel accuracy, but swing patterns) I find it very useful when the athlete has an uncomfortably weighted bat to swing. I prefer just a heavy wood bat, but I get really good results from bat weights( the jack-it and donuts). The point is that that pattern needs to be strongly mapped and the athlete needs to have the wherewithal not to press the hands/arms to get the barrel into the zone. This ties into how weighted balls and plyo balls can rewrite inefficient patterns. At first, a poor thrower may push the heavier ball. Good coaching cues, dynamic actions with focus and intent can iron out the process and pattern quickly. With the swing, a heavy bat will help the athlete feel the depth of the barrel bottom out early in the turn in the proper pattern. Like the tendency for an inefficient thrower to push a heavier object at first, heavy bats will further ingrain a bad pressing pattern when left unattended. Also, the different placements of donut  weights, jack-its etc can make this even harder to recognize as you described since sometimes more weight is felt closer to the hands. This is like anything else, any good drill can be woefully miscued or misconstrued by an athlete. Likewise, seemingly ridiculously drill work like throwing heavy balls hard in a pick-off stance can have truly breakthrough results with the right constraints being met. I like to test the “stickiness” of a pattern by seeing the athlete maintain his turn, barrel action depth and momentum transfer hold up to variable bat weights and balances.
What sorts of drills are used with the Plyocare balls? I’ve been looking everywhere and can only find a couple drills in your videos, was wondering if theres anywhere that you talk about drills, rep schemes, etc with them. Thanks
That information is forthcoming in our flagship book and video set product, due out this offseason (December 1st, hopefully).
Hi Kyle,
Back in 2013 Graeme Lehman posted an article on his site regarding a study, ” The acute and chronic effects of isometric contraction conditioning on baseball bat velocity” indicating that a simple on deck warm up routine that induced PAP with isometric contractions increased bat speed. The protocol involved hitters performing four reps of max effort isometric contraction for 5 seconds. A five second rest was allowed between repetitions. The first and third sets used the lead hand while the second and forth sets used the trail hand.  They then rested for one minute and were then able to swing harder than before. As hitting and pitching have similar rotational qualities, do you have any thoughts on whether this might be beneficial for pitchers? Lehman was also considering a study for pitchers using the “Hershiser drill” as the isometric contraction, however, I haven’t seen anything from him on this. Curious to get your thoughts.
[…] This follows our standard regular-overload-regular-underload pattern that we’ve tested over the years. […]

Return to Throwing Program,2015-09-30T14:05:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/05/reinvention-casey-weathers-restoring-tommy-john-took/,"The traditional model for phases of rehab that occur after Tommy John surgery look something like this:
This blog will focus on improvements that can be made in a return to throwing program.
ThiThis blog was updated on 6/3/2022 and was written by Dean Jackson and Kyle Lindley, edited by Michael O’Connell
Below is an example of what an Interval Throwing Program may look like.
It’s our opinion at Driveline Baseball that this type of program has three major flaws:
Let’s break them down:
Your first day throwing on this program involves two sets of “warm-up throws” and 50 total throws from 45 feet. If you split the difference on the warm-up throws and call it 15 throws each (10-20 per the document), then you are making 80 total throws on your first post-surgery throwing day!
The most common side effect of these types of programs involves soreness and setbacks due to the inability to overcome the volume of the program. This can create a vicious cycle of starting, stopping, and restarting a throwing program.
Our article detailing “pulldown” throws goes into a bit of detail, but players need to be tested at game-like intensities before they return to competition. We need to make sure that they are occurring at the appropriate time
Secondly, there is no monitoring outside of distance. Pitchers going out to 180 feet on this program do so at varying angles, velocities, and intent. Throwing at 40 mph or 60 mph at 60 feet should not be equal.
This program cannot be equally effective for the MLB pitcher who sits 95 MPH and the 17-year-old who sits 83 MPH. Other than different starting points, there are drastically different resources available to one over another.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also has its flaws as a measure of intensity.
Previous research has shown that the percentage of effort that a pitcher is trying to throw at does not correlate strongly with how hard the pitcher is throwing compared to their velocity peak (Slenker, Limpisvasti, et al. – Biomechanical comparison of the interval throwing program and baseball pitching: upper extremity loads in training and rehabilitation AJSM May 2014).
At 60% of perceived effort, pitchers were generating forces of 76% and ball speeds approaching 84% of maximum intensity.
Pitchers are really bad at estimating how much effort they are expending and consistently underestimate it. This should have profound implications for rehabilitation programs.
Programs are often written in a way that doesn’t account for the rest of a player’s life.
Some baseball players returning from surgery have a nice, smooth recovery process. Others do not. Some players’ bodies won’t let them progress for a few weeks. Other athletes feel incredible, and they feel ahead of schedule. It’s a rollercoaster to try and help a player along with  Physical Therapists and surgeons.
They are difficult to adjust in all areas because everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Because of this, there will often be some sort of setback due to throwing volume and intensity. After all, everyone will respond differently to a program. But we need to remember that other factors outside of the throwing program can also cause setbacks. Lack of sleep, varying nutrition, school load, or travel are a few reasons that can also cause setbacks.
The fact of the matter is tools exist today that can raise the standards of Tommy John rehab. We want a standardized approach but an individualized method.
The solution is to use technology to better track progress and make programs individualized. This means utilizing
Combined with subjective measures, these objective measures give us the best chance for the next revolution of rehab programs.
Using Pulse and a radar gun, we can monitor the following variables:
You can read more about the metrics on Pulse here.
We can use those to better supplement subjective measures by asking the athlete questions such as:
We can combine these to create the four main phases of our return to throwing program:
We can layer on more extensive monitoring with Pulse and Radar Gun inside these phases.
Arm Speed will be used as our primary monitoring tool until ~700 RPM Arm Speed. Reaching ~700 Arm Speed typically occurs after several weeks of throwing.
Once ~700 RPM arm speed is reached, we would switch to a combination of arm speed and throwing velocity. Arm speed and velocity would be used to continue progressing intensity through the remainder of the rehab. We choose ~700 RPM Arm Speed because that is approximately where Pulse Arm Speed starts to deviate from throwing velocity.
We would progress intensity using object data (arm speed and throwing velocity) and subjective data from that point on. Focusing on how he felt he was recovering, how his mechanics looked like his, and how his body responded well to the increased intensity.
The example below is from a return to throwing program with athlete Ryan Cloude. This example represents a sample of what can be done with a data-driven return to throwing program. The advice dispensed in this article would certainly not work for everyone for the reasons stated above. We know how weighted balls affect the torque on the arm and workload, the example program below only used baseballs.
Ryan Cloude is a 21-year-old collegiate pitcher. He has an interesting training history, having increased his pitching velocity from 83mph as a college freshman to topping at 95mph as a junior. In the middle of his junior season, he tore his UCL and required UCL reconstruction.
The goal of this phase was to build a throwing volume base at a low intensity. We start all our athletes off with a low threshold to set them up for increased intensity later.
Ryan threw 3x per week during this 4-week phase. We monitored Arm Speed with Pulse, gradually increasing from a one-session average of ~200 RPM and top 1/8th ~250 RPM to a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM.
Total throws per session increased from 25 to 90 from the beginning to the last day of the phase.
We built this phase of the throwing volume base established in Phase 1 by increasing the throwing intensity on Monday and Friday each week.
Once Ryan hit the ~700 RPM arm speed mark, we switched measuring intensity from Arm Speed to throwing velocity.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM to a one-session average of ~600 RPM and top 1/8th ~850 RPM. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 49.9 mph and top 1/8th 57.6 mph to a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th 76.0 mph.
Instead of throw counts, Ryan was given options between 60-90 throws on the higher intensity days. At the same time, lower intensity days progressed gradually from 90 to 120 throws. He did the max number of throws most days, except for three days where the daily notes had some variation of “another crazy conditioning at 6 am this morning, body felt dead. Stopped at 60 throws”—no arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
One week, the same intensity was repeated (instead of progressing it) because Ryan was exhausted from team conditioning and didn’t want to push it.
Return to throwing templates lack guidelines on how to make adjustments to the program. At times the adjustment doesn’t need to be because something went wrong with the throwing program. But other parts of a player’s life are still ongoing when rehabbing a throwing injury. Tracking these programs leaves a player and a coach in a much better place to make an appropriate adjustment.
The only difference between the schedule of this phase and the last is that instead of the weeks going HLH, HLH (higher intensity, low, higher, and repeat), they went HLH, LHL (higher intensity, low, repeat). This shifted Ryan from 4 higher intensity throwing days every two weeks to 3 high-intensity throwing days every two weeks.
There were two new additions in phase three. First, bullpens at lower intensity began in this phase. Second, we started to focus more on moving efficiently. We measure movement efficiency by throwing the prescribed velocity with the lowest possible arm speed.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~600 and top 1/8th of ~850 to a one-session average of ~700 and top 1/8th of ~ 925. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th of 76.0 mph to a one-session average of 69.6 mph and top 1/8th of 89.4 mph.
His volume options remained 60-90 on higher intensity days and 90-120 on lower intensity days. Ryan decided not to throw the max amount of throws on a given day: total body soreness from training with his team and getting kicked out of the gym as it was closing. No arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
Bullpen throwing velocity was dropped back to the high 70s, with two pens being thrown each week, and lower intensity days were added over a couple of weeks until Ryan was throwing five days a week.
Throwing velocity on main bullpen days gradually increased from a one-session average of 64.5 mph and top 1/8th of 77.4 mph to a one-session average of 74.2 and top 1/8th 90.9 mph.
We had phases that we wanted to progress through and a good idea how roughly how much we should progress over a certain period, but ultimately we let Ryan’s body decide if it was ready to progress or not.
If the prescribed intensity for a session wasn’t comfortable, we would not progress intensity in the next session (regardless of what the program template said). We would repeat the intensity (or reduce it) until it was comfortable. The main idea in the intensity prescribing process was “letting the door be opened” when Ryan’s body was ready and not trying to “kick the door down” and force a more intense stimulus on his arm before it was ready.
Other pitch types were added first to recovery days during this phase. Simply by throwing offspeed in flat ground or catch play/long toss work. Intensity and volume were gradually increased until Ryan was throwing at maximum intensity on the mound.
Volume options for total throws on each bullpen day gradually increased from 60-90 to 90-110, while volume options for lower intensity days stayed 90-120. Once Ryan’s velocity got back into the high 80’s a few bullpens turned into recovery days because he didn’t feel fully recovered.
The first live session versus hitters happened roughly 10.5 months post-op and went well enough that Ryan decided he was ready to face hitters in a game that counted for his team. The first outing versus hitters in a real game happened just before the 11-month post-op mark and resulted in 1IP 0H 0BB 3K.
After completing his return to play, Ryan reflected on the process as a whole:
“Having objective data to show my progress was massive for my mental state. On days where I wasn’t able to hit my goal or days where I felt I was so far away from being healthy, I’d be able to look back and see how much harder I was throwing and how much more arm speed I was able to handle.”
It’s widespread to hear athletes talk about the mental toll injuries took on them and how grueling the whole experience is. I believe collecting data to give athletes a good idea of where they are now, where they have been, and where they need to go can significantly improve how comfortable their experience with rehab ends up being.
Ryan also said:
“(I) loved having a progression based on how I was recovering and not a cookie-cutter program that’s the same for everyone.”
We’re attacking it via our integrated staff training methods, technology, and Driveline TRAQ – and results have never been better, both on the performance AND rehab sides.

What it Takes to Play at the Next Level: Work Ethic - Driveline Baseball,2012-12-04T09:40:14+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2012/12/what-it-takes-to-play-at-the-next-level-work-ethic/,"How many times have you heard (or said) the words: “I’d do anything to play at the next level,” where next level could be college, minors, or major league baseball? Probably a lot if you’re a coach or a current player.
If you’re a player who says that, no offense, but I don’t believe you. One of the reasons I chose to work at RIPS Baseball is the fact that the owner (Aaron) opens the place at 6 AM every day of the week (open at 8 AM on Sunday, we take Saturday off) and we stay open until 10 PM. That’s 16 hours per day to get your work in.
So here’s a simple question: If you really would do anything to play at the next level, we make it possible to get your work in before school. (Also, we don’t charge you anything if you want to get more work in.) So how many kids routinely come in at 6 AM to hit and lift?
Basically none. The last kid to put in that kind of ridiculous work was Josh Sale, who ended up making a few dollars in the MLB draft not long ago. When given the opportunity to put in extra work (for free, mind you), the excuses I hear are pretty good, my favorite being “Well, RIPS is too far away to do that.”
Well, Josh drove 30-35 minutes from Seattle to Burien every morning before school to hit, then drove that same 30 minutes back to school, then came back for more practice. He also lifted at home and went to his high school practices and kept up on his private school homework load.
Additionally, I worked with a client who built a bullpen out of the sands of the desert in Afghanistan at his forward operating base and threw side sessions and long toss in 120 degree heat after morning PT and before going out on combat patrols.
What it takes to succeed at the next level is a ludicrous obsession with your craft. If you don’t have that desire, then that’s totally fine with me. Few people do. But don’t lie to me, and most importantly, don’t lie to yourself. Don’t say that you’d do whatever it took, then years later when you wash out of baseball, continue the lie and say “Well, I just got unlucky/hurt/injured/whatever.”
Do me that favor, at least. And if you want to put in that kind of work, you know where to find me and Aaron.
Landon, we applaud your work ethic. Take your recovery (sleep) seriously as well! If you are the type of athlete that is putting in this kind of work, then we’d like to help you reach your goals. Whether remotely or in-person, let’s find something that works for you!

"Training to Meet Your Goals: Simple, But Not Easy - Driveline Baseball",2012-04-09T21:30:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2012/04/training-to-meet-your-goals-simple-but-not-easy/,"Fitness guru Dan John has a famous saying: “I said it was simple. Not easy.”
Dan means that it’s not difficult to know what you need to do to succeed in your craft – but it’s not easy. The popular nonfiction books like Outliers and Talent is Overrated talk about the 10,000 hour rule – the requirement that you must put in 10,000 hours of deliberate practice in to succeed in a given field.
Everyone at the Driveline Baseball / Driveline Athletics facility works very hard, and it’s not for everyone. Many have quit, and some have been asked to leave – our facility is meant for the athlete who is serious about putting in the work to become the best athlete they can be. We’re not a babysitting service.
For those who have trained here, they’ve seen their fastball velocities jump, their bat speed rocket, overall fitness increase, and skill improve across the board.
And so it is with great pleasure that I can say that one of our hardest workers has been rewarded for his dedication: Jack Scheideman has been offered and will accept a scholarship to throw the shot put, discus, and hammer at the University of Washington!
Jack on the left in mid-2011
Jack started throwing the shot put when he decided baseball wasn’t the sport for him. He threw for the first time in competition in his junior year at Roosevelt HS in early 2011. Jack has been throwing the shot put and discus for about 14 months, and he started throwing in the high 30’s, which is just north of absolutely terrible.
He knew he’d have to put on some weight, so he started eating a ton: He went from 170 pounds to 240 pounds in 12 months.
In the ring, he took a grueling throwing program his uncle (an accomplished throws coach from the Midwest) gave him and executed it perfectly. His uncle asked him to throw six times per week; Jack would make it an everyday affair, not missing a day for 6+ months (when I forced him to take a few days off here and there – he wasn’t pleased with it). Roosevelt HS does not have a throwing ring, so he would take the bus to a school a few miles away – Nathan Hale HS – where he’d jump the 10 foot fence and throw in the rain, snow, wind, and terrible conditions in the winter, day in and day out. He would soon video tape all of his throwing sessions for later analysis. His uncle forced him to throw a 16 pound shot for months because Jack was unnecessarily focusing on distance with a regulation shot put – and Jack complied. He focused on throwing mechanics while throwing a college-level shot put that frustrated him to no end.
In the gym, Jack knew he had to get stronger. He went from a 185 pound back squat to a 485 pound back squat in that timeframe too – adding on a 540 deadlift, 280 power clean, 290 pound bench press, and many other strength/power markers – coming to the gym after his daily throwing workouts miles away.
Jack made these gains in about 14 months.
Jack would throw 53 and 54 feet in the shot and 145-150 in the discus to kick off 2012, which was solid but not great. However, Jack then went to a local invitational, where he threw 57’8″ in the shot and threw the discus past the measuring field, giving him a distance of at least 160 feet. When the UW throws coach contacted him, he asked Jack to send in transcripts to see if they could get him into the school (he was denied admission from simply applying) – and then Jack told him about his performance at the invitational. The coach had extremely positive things to say, and asked Jack if he could get a commitment to the program. After calling the necessary people and considering his options (having a few other offers out there), Jack decided to take the scholarship at UW and fulfill his life’s dream: Becoming a student-athlete at the school he grew up worshipping.
Jack was not a genetically gifted athlete – he didn’t pick up the shot put and immediately throw it 50 feet. Jack was a decent but not amazing baseball player; he’s not naturally fast and does not display a freakish vertical leap.
What Jack did was very simple: Trained every single day in the ring, every single day in the weight room (until overtraining set in months later, where we put him on a 4-day split), and consumed a ton of calories. He cut out excessive partying and didn’t go out much with friends, preferring to focus on his schoolwork and his training program.
Lots of people say they want to play varsity sports, play for a college team, or play pro sports – but few are willing to do the work that is required to even sniff their dreams.
It’s not difficult to understand: You just have to train constantly and watch everything you eat. People want to make excuses that they didn’t get to the upper levels of their sport because they didn’t know how to train or they were beat by people who were simply more gifted, but they almost always don’t make it because they didn’t work hard enough. Simple as that.
And we want to glorify the person who works very hard and achieves his dream, like Jack did. However, to focus on the end goal is useless and vain. You will never succeed if you think about the end goal – you must take pleasure in the hard work and deliberate practice that you will grow to hate. You have to understand that you will hate training and that there will be a huge number of setbacks and that you will fail over and over again – and not only do you need to understand this, but you need to embrace it. You must learn to accept – and even love – failure.
You can watch all the motivational speeches you want on YouTube and get that fire inside you – but the real elite athlete forges on when that flame is extinguished early on and stays dark for months on end.
Deliberate practice is hopeless, boring, and agonizing – but it’s the only way to achieve your goals. If you don’t like that, I completely understand: 24 hour fitness is always looking for new members, and so are the local rec leagues.
Pretty awesome story, although I weep at the plug for those awful conjecture-filled books.

Guest Blog: Preventing Chronic Lower Back Pain in Baseball Players - Driveline Baseball,2012-02-10T00:00:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2012/02/guest-blog-preventing-chronic-lower-back-pain-in-baseball-players/,"This guest blog comes from Kevin Rindal, DC, CSCS, and owner of InHealth Seattle – our primary Seattle physical therapy partner! We’re proud to have a strong partnership with Dr. Rindal, who performs Active Release Technique, chiropractic, Graston/ASTYM, and many other rehabilitative services and procedures. I can’t recommend him highly enough, as we’ve discussed biomechanics and kinesiology at length about a variety of sports/activities, and Dr. Rindal is also my personal PT and Chiropractor (I have two herniated discs – L4 and L5 – and treatment at InHealth Seattle has all but eliminated the symptoms).
Enjoy!
——-
Have you ever wondered why some people experience lower back pain on a recurrent basis?   As a baseball player it can be extremely limiting to your ability to throw, catch, run, and hit.  Many athletes who initially come to our office for treatment have a history of one or more previous acute bouts of lower back pain, and are seeking treatment for another “flare-up.”  Even though these individuals may not consistently experience lower back pain, between painful episodes, they are often heading down a path leading to chronic daily lower back pain.
Research has shown that pain and previous injuries can both inhibit proper muscle function.  We see this manifested in chronic lower back pain patients in what is called the “feed forward mechanism.”  Through the use of Electromyographic (EMG) studies, researchers have discovered that the deep stabilizing muscles of the lumbar spine, called the lumbar multifidii, are usually the first muscles to contract when the body is preparing for a quick response.  An example of this is when an object, such as a baseball, is thrown in our direction; before the large muscle of the spine contract, in an effort to move the body to avoid the object that was thrown, the multifidii muscles will have already contracted to brace and support the spine. This action of the multifidii occurs without us even having to think about bracing our spine.  However, in chronic lower back pain patients, this feed-forward mechanism is either delayed or absent.  This fact is clinically relevant, as often we see acute flare-ups developing from a simple motion such as the quick jarring of the body in response to missing a step…thus, the multifidii’s inability to brace the spine in time resulting in excessive strain to the other spinal stabilizing structures.
A May 2009 study published in the scientific journal Pain1 used muscle EMG to evaluate 15 patients with recurrent, unilateral pain (pain on one side of the body), who were currently asymptomatic, and 19 healthy control subjects with no previous history of lower back pain.  This group of researchers found that the patients with previous history of lower back pain did indeed demonstrate reduced function of the deep layers of the multifidus on the previously symptomatic side.  This study confirms what many of us in the spinal rehabilitation fields have assumed for quite some time, namely, that deep seeded muscle dysfunction is present in low back pain sufferers, and retraining the function of these deep pelvic and lumbar stabilizers is essential to completely resolve a patient’s lumbar spinal dysfunction.
At InHealth Seattle, we emphasize “core stability” with each and every lower back pain patient, as well as the importance of continuing their home exercise program after the pain has resolved.   Exercises such as “Kegels,” Pelvic Tilts, “Abdominal Hollowing,” “Plank,” “Side-Bridge,” and the “Bird Dog” are examples of exercise that activate the important deep layers of muscle that stabilize the spine, and can enhance your performance as a baseball player.
If you would like more information regarding this article, or exercises that you could perform as a preventative measure to fight chronic lower back pain, please contact Dr. Kevin Rindal at InHealth Seattle to schedule an appointment (206-315-7998).

"Never Say ""I Could Have Done More"" - Driveline Baseball",2011-11-28T03:30:19+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/11/never-say-i-could-have-done-more/,"The lack of blog posts lately has been due to a very busy schedule on multiple fronts. I hope to post at least twice per week going forward.
When training for any competitive event, there will be times when you want to give up and take an unscheduled break. This is only natural, because the very thing that makes a competitor great is also the same thing that is tedious, boring, and often hopeless: Deliberate practice.
Deliberate practice, as I’ve said countless times before, is paying precise attention to what you are doing on a daily basis to improve. You must compare yourself to your former self, others you are trying to beat, the greatest in the world at your sport/activity, and figure out how to move forward. Progress isn’t a straight path from beginner to expert; every great competitor spent days, weeks, months, even years maintaining or even regressing in their skills – sometimes due to injury, sometimes just due to the impossible difficulty of the task at hand. It is precisely at these times when the temptation is so great to want to give up that it seems impossible to continue on.
But if you do, in 5, 10, or 15 years, you’ll eventually look back and say “I could have done more.”
One of my clients is playing baseball at a college where the program’s coaches are short on understanding pitching mechanics and exercise science, and the majority of his teammates don’t see the value in things like throwing weighted baseballs, frequent long toss, or squatting heavy two or three times per week. He’s made big strides from his high school junior year to his freshman year of college, so he’s behind the development curve a bit, but he has an outside chance of playing professional baseball if he keeps up the hard work that gave him the chance to play college baseball. The environment that he’s in keeps him down because the coaches are constantly harping on him about his weight room activities (he does extra work on top of their high-rep bodybuilding regimen) or thoughts about pitching mechanics, but he knows that he has to keep his head down and simply bust his butt. One of his responses to someone harping on him about his heavy deadlifts was: “You do you, I’ll do me, and we’ll see who starts on the field in the spring.” You have to turn around the negativity and turn it into a positive motivator to keep yourself going.
Another one of my clients is throwing the shot put for only his second year. As a high school senior, he’s very far behind in experience. However, a relative of his is a well-known high school throws coach in the Midwest, and he’s a big proponent of working hard, lifting hard, and eating big. This client went from 165 pounds to 250 pounds in just about 16 months by eating tons of food, drinking lots of milk, and lifting frequently. Now that he’s developed a decent level of strength, he’s cut back the lifting and has been throwing every day on his relative’s workout plan. His high school does not have a throwing ring, so he has to take the bus to another school a few miles away, but their ring is fenced off and locked. No one is ever practicing there, naturally, so he has to hop the fence with his 12 and 16 pound shot puts in his backpack. While there, he sets up his camera and makes 50-70 throws with varying techniques (some standing, some halfs, some full motion throws). Three times a week after he’s done, he hops the fence and catches the bus to Driveline Athletics, where he’ll lift heavy stuff.
I’m rehabbing herniated discs in L4-L5 due to a lifetime of terrible posture while sitting down (I firmly believe schools ingrain this terrible posture by forcing kids to sit for hours at a time in class). Last year I had it nearly painfree with regular visits to the chiropractor and doing my own rehab protocol, but after my son was born, I reaggravated it due to sitting with a flexed spine. I couldn’t properly rehab it while playing baseball and pitching twice per week, so it continued to be a chronic issue – especially bad in the mornings. However, the offseason is here, and I’ve taken control of my rehab so I can compete as best I can in 2012. I’m doing over 250 reps/day of back extensions, reverse hypers, yoga posture poses, tire flips, deadlifts, pull-ups, Pallof presses, and other back work to regain full function and start squatting heavy again. By February of 2012, I need to be at 100% to head into my baseball season, and I don’t want to look back with sciatic pain in my right leg and wish “I could have done more.”
Deliberate practice is really boring, painful, and soul-eating. But the alternative is a life full of regret. Don’t wish you could have done more.
[…] telling everybody, ‘yeah, I used to play minor league ball, but injuries derailed my career.’  I’m not going to do that.  That’s just an excuse. […]

3 Must Own Pieces of Training Equipment if You Want to Throw 90 MPH - Driveline Baseball,2011-09-05T20:00:23+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/09/3-must-own-pieces-of-training-equipment-if-you-want-to-throw-90-mph/,"Assuming that you’re not a genetically gifted freak and can throw 90 MPH as a 14 year old like all those people on YouTube seem to be able to, here are three pieces of equipment you must own (and use, no cheating!) to throw 90 MPH:
Squat Rack / Power Cage
Any serious athlete starts with owning or having ready access to a power cage. Period.
Power Cage (ah, I miss the old place)
In a power cage, you can safely fail your back/front squats, do inverted rows, work with your TRX suspension trainer, easily hook up your resistance bands for mobility/flexibility work, do chin-ups/pull-ups, and a host of other things. Sure, some of this can be done with a simple pair of squat stands, but not all of it.
So get a power cage (and a quality barbell while you’re at it; we like Jesup Gym’s equipment) or get access to a gym that has one. You can’t effectively build bilateral lower half strength without it, and without that, you’re not going to throw gas (or hit bombs over the fence, which is what all the chicks dig anyway).
Throwing a baseball is a ballistic activity that requires tons of rotational power and speed-strength. You have to work explosively in the frontal plane and translate momentum in an appropriate sequence through the legs, core, and finally the arms to throw 90 MPH. But you can’t pitch every day or throw 400 baseballs per day without risking some injuries to your soft tissue, and varying the stimulus is important for optimum muscle tissue growth and neurological development. So how do you balance it all out?
Whoops.
Medicine balls, of course. (The above image is what will happen if you throw them enough. We’ve ruptured a 10 lb, 4 kg, and 4 lb ball so far.)
I recommend picking up a 4 lb, 6 lb, and 10 lb medicine ball (buy them from Amazon where they ship for free) for various movements: Side scoop tosses, rotational elbow extension movements, overhead slams – the works! You can find all types of varieties of medicine ball training on our YouTube channel, so go check that out and search for “medicine ball” stuff.
You simply can’t beat the speed-strength training stimulus you get from medicine balls, and not many gyms have them. So you probably gotta shell out some bucks for them.
We’ve come a long way at Driveline Baseball by integrating under/overload training principles with weighted baseballs in our Elite Baseball Training program. First we introduced them as a supplementary exercise with long toss, flat ground work, and throwing off a mound, but after the results we’ve seen by combining their use with a solid strength-based training protocol, we’re totally sold.
Weighted Baseballs
We outlined a free weighted baseball training protocol on our site back in 2010, and while we’ve developed on that plan, it’s still one of the most popular articles on the site. Many people have written in to say that they’ve added velocity and that their arm has never felt better after implementing our free program, and our athletes in our Elite Baseball Training program are definitely reaping the rewards as well.
So, if you don’t own those pieces of equipment – or at least have ready access to them – go get them! The off-season is right around the corner which is the time to build velocity and skill, so don’t slack on it. Spring baseball will be here before you know it: Will you be ready for tryouts?

Some Light Reading: The Athlete's Shoulder and Low Back Disorders - Driveline Baseball,2011-08-18T21:30:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/08/some-light-reading-the-athletes-shoulder-and-low-back-disorders/,"The Athlete's Shoulder
The Athlete’s Shoulder is an outstanding text written by a vast array of experts in the shoulder rehabilitation field – Kevin Wilk, Mike Reinold, Glenn Fleisig, James Andrews, and many, many others. It’s also over 800 pages worth of research, summaries, protocols, images, diagrams, and evidenced-based rehabilitation programs – all of it on the shoulder alone!
I’ve leafed through a copy that a physical therapist friend owns, but he’s highly protective of it and keeps it at his side at all times in his office. So, I finally broke down and picked up a copy for myself. My first reaction was: “Good lord, this thing is enormous!” And at 800+ pages, you better believe it is.
However, the book is a must-own for any trainer who works with overhead athletes – tennis players, baseball pitchers, volleyball strikers, handball throwers, and so forth. There’s just a gold mine of information in the book that you can’t find anywhere else. Though the price tag is steep (about $120 on Amazon), it’s well-worth it – just ask any physical therapist or trainer who works with injured athletes, and they’ll confirm that belief.
I also picked up a copy of Low Back Disorders, written by back guru Stuart McGill. This book personally hits home for me, as I’ve been rehabilitating a herniated disc in my spine around L4-L5. I’ve been seeing a chiropractor, neuroscientist, and have been following the excellent advice in the $10 book Treat Your Own Back by Robin McKenzie. However, I wanted to pick up a book that had a little more substance to it, and McGill’s book comes highly recommended by trainers and physical therapists around the world.
Low Back Disorders
I’ve only briefly skimmed a few pages of the book, but I can immediately understand how it will be useful in designing training protocols for both healthy and injured populations at Driveline Baseball.
We consider Research Studies and continuing education to be a vitally important part of our platform at Driveline Baseball. We think that keeping on top of current and past research studies on sports science and kinesiology can only help us design more effective and safer programs for our high school, collegiate, and professional athletes in all sports – particularly our Elite Baseball Training program.

The Importance of Training Environment - Driveline Baseball,2011-08-16T21:30:02+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/08/the-importance-of-training-environment/,"Jack, our throws athlete (meaning discus and shot put), wrote this great article about The Importance of Training Environment over at our other blog/site, Driveline Athletics. Here’s an excerpt:
At Driveline Athletics I’m surrounded by people who work hard and understand what training is and help you reach those goals. No one uses a pillow on squats or does bicep curls or stares at you like you are crazy. We play music we like; we’re not looked down upon when we throw bumper plates down: We understand what training is at Driveline Athletics.   I did not realize or understood how important these people at Driveline Athletics and environment were to my training. If you are struggling with form they will help you if you have a heavy squat set they will motivate you through it.  It has been harder than I thought to train in Maine and I will always take this into account. I will always try to be with people who want to train and work hard. I will always be grateful for what I have at Driveline Athletics. Remember to always train with people who want to train and work hard. It will make a huge difference in the long run.
Thanks, Jack!

This myth is complete garbage, and it’s perpetuated by training facilities in the Pacific Northwest like WBI Sports. They even run a banner that claims that weights have been removed from the Mariners training facility! No weights in the weight room, you say? Then what’s in the background of the Seattle Mariners’ spring training facility?
Mariner’s ST Weight Room
Let me tell you exactly what’s in the background: Weights. Specifically:
And this is just what we can see in the shot. There might even be… MORE WEIGHTS! You can find that shot in this video about Dr. Marcus Elliot’s training program for the Mariners. Additionally, we have athletes at our facility that have trained under Dr. Marcus Elliot and can confirm that they have done basic barbell lifts in addition to other ballistic activities like medicine ball throws and high-speed cable rotational work. So, WBI Sports (and many other training facilities with a misguided agenda) are either spreading blatant lies or haven’t done their research. In either case, I’m not sure why you would send someone to train there – the best case scenario is that they haven’t done a full evaluation of what professional players are doing. The worst case scenario is that they are intentionally lying about the Mariners’ program to cover up the fact they haven’t invested money into a solid strength/power/speed training facility like Driveline Baseball has, or they don’t have the trainers to set up such a facility and corresponding program.
That’s all I ask of places like WBI Sports. It’s very plainly evident that Dr. Marcus Elliot’s programs are well-designed, and this means a program that involves compound lifts to effectively and quickly develop basic levels of strength before moving on to more complex programming. It does not mean you should omit weight lifting from your baseball training program – always double-check your facts, especially when someone has a vested interest in selling you a product or service. Driveline Baseball trainers actively encourage their clients to ask questions and do their own research to see if the Elite Baseball Training program matches up with their expectations and that it will get them to their end goal: A higher level of baseball. We’ve incorporated a lot of client suggestions into our workouts and programming as a result.

The Fallacy of Hard Work - Driveline Baseball,2011-06-17T22:30:23+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/06/the-fallacy-of-hard-work/,"I get it a lot from potential clients:
Except that the majority of people who say this have no idea what it will take to reach these goals. Most are content to come in to the gym 3-4 times per week, lift, take batting practice, and study their hitting and pitching mechanics before going to team practices and games. Certainly these athletes will improve rapidly and become pretty good, as many clients who come through my facility have.
But what it takes to play at the top levels of baseball – be it premier college baseball or professional baseball – takes a kind of dedication that few people have. Most athletes are content to put in what they think is “hard work,” which is basically what I outlined above. I would call that a good starting point and nothing more than that. The moment you classify your efforts as “hard work” is exactly when you stop getting better at your craft.
Consider this excellent article on 2010 1st round draft pick Josh Sale.
It is 6:15 a.m., and Josh Sale is hunting.
While several bleary-eyed teenagers amble into RIPS Baseball Training Complex, the Bishop Blanchet senior is wide awake, ready to work. He walks in with two bats — one metal, one wood — and walks past a row of cages.
Off to one side, large sheets of lined yellow paper are stapled to a green wall. There is a list of times on each sheet, and Sale’s name is written between 6 and 6:30 a.m. five days a week.
He stretches and slips on batting gloves. He steps under the netting of Cage 4 and picks up a T-ball bat. He takes one-handed cuts off a tee. Then he grabs a wooden bat and practices a walk-up approach off the tee.
One step. Two steps. Thwack. Swoosh. The ball explodes into the netting.
Then Aaron Horrocks, Sale’s personal hitting coach, lobs him some underhand pitches. After that, he takes live batting practice.
Josh terrorized amateur pitchers in the Seattle area for years. He was big, imposing, a huge physical specimen with scary bat speed and a picky eye. One of the pitchers here at our facility loves to talk about nearly getting Sale out on a dropped foul ball – only to let up a 400+ foot mammoth home run on a cutter he left over the plate. (Alright, maybe we tease him about it and he doesn’t actually enjoy hearing about it.)
Most thought Sale was a physical freak. But in truth, what made Sale an elite hitter was his dedication – his drive. He took batting practice every morning before classes, religiously followed a strength training program, ate plenty of calories to get big, and sought the toughest competition he possibly could to improve.
Taking batting practice in the morning and working out after school (and then taking more batting practice in the evening) is fun. For about two weeks. But to become the best athlete you can be, you need to repeat that effort for years – week in and week out. It sucks. You’ll hate it at times, because there’s no way you can love deliberate practice all the time.
But if you don’t put forth that kind of effort, you won’t succeed. And if you dare to call it “hard work,” well, you might as well write yourself off. There’s always something more you can do, and there’s always someone outworking you, vying for the same roster spot you want.
You have to let that drive you. You have to be driven to want to beat that guy. Maybe he has better genetics, maybe he was born with more innate talent – that’s not something you can control. If he beats you because of that, so be it. But if he beats you because you got complacent, because he outworked you – you shouldn’t be able to live with that, if you want to call yourself a competitor.
Those are the people we want in our gym. We’ll open the cages at 6 AM before school or 10 PM when you get out of work. I’ll throw you batting practice, catch your bullpens, and you can come in on your own to get your heavy lifting done or to take batting practice off our machines. But it has to come from you. I’m not your dad. I’m not your motivator. You need to want it more than anyone else in the area for your own reasons.
If that’s you, we have all the tools you need to develop into an elite athlete. All that’s missing is you and your work ethic.

A Salute to Two Trainees: Jack and Eli - Driveline Baseball,2011-06-02T22:00:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/06/a-salute-to-two-trainees-jack-and-eli/,"About two years ago, I started training these two guys in the garage of my townhome in North Seattle. All we had were some crappy Costco-style barbells, Weider plates, and an unused power cage that I bought off bodybuilding.com. The place couldn’t have been more than 14 feet wide, 35 feet long, and 8 feet tall, leaving no room for overhead pressing unless you took the barbell outside (which we often did).
The humble beginnings
Yet we got a lot of our best work done there. Both Jack and Eli were rank novices, and I was restarting a real strength program, so we all made pretty good linear progress doing some basic compound lifting. I had been training Eli for years prior to that point as his pitching coach, and he brought along Jack for the ride.
Occasionally, we’d get outside and play with some new toys. I contracted with a welder on Craigslist and had our weight sled custom-built for us. I bought a pair of EliteFTS Blast Straps, and we used them to pull the sled across the wet grass at the local park. We paired sled push/pull circuits with plate carries to simulate farmer’s walks (I wouldn’t get a pair of real farmer’s walks until over a year later), two-handed swings with plates on an adjustable dumbbell to simulate kettlebells (a recent addition to our facility), and other creative fitness / metabolic conditioning movements.
At the time, I was developing some pretty good strength levels, albeit at a pretty high bodyweight (260 lbs, 6’1″). I was able to deadlift 505 and back squat 455. I had to make a choice: Continue to play baseball, or think about training as a powerlifter/strongman. I eventually decided to drop some weight, maintain as much strength as possible, and play baseball.
Prior to my back and leg injury a few months ago (unrelated to weight lifting; it’s healing up pretty well and is a topic for another blog post), I was 220 pounds with a back squat of at least 405 pounds (it was pretty easy, I would estimate my 1RM at the time to be ~420 lbs), deadlift of 465 pounds, power clean of 225 pounds, and a bench press of 250 pounds. Overall, I was pretty happy with those numbers, even if those bench press and power clean numbers aren’t very good. (I never did like benching.)
Meanwhile, Jack and Eli, despite setbacks (Jack tore his hip flexor running the 60 yard dash during baseball tryouts as a sophomore, Eli would have to cut weight and miss a lot of training days as a wrestler – and he would later suffer a bad concussion, sidelining him for months), continued to build their strength, just like novices do. They put in a lot of hard work, and managed to put up some respectable numbers while working around their issues and athletic seasons. Eli has posted a personal best in the deadlift (his favorite lift) of 425 pounds at a ridiculous bodyweight of 169.5 pounds, while Jack has posted a back squat of 405 pounds, bench press of 255 pounds (likely to be higher now), power clean of 255 pounds, and a power snatch of around 200 pounds at a bodyweight hovering between 230-240 pounds.
Along the way, Eli got his fastball velocity consistently over 80 MPH through weighted ball training (and other velocity development concepts) while simultaneously developing very good bat speed (finishing in the top three in batting average on his varsity baseball team against tough competition), and Jack qualified for KingCo competition in just his first year of throwing the shot and discus with a shot put throw of 43′ 1.25″ and a 116′ 1″ discus throw. He did this despite his high school having no scheduled throwing ring time at the only close facility near us, and I expect him to post some vast improvements on those numbers in 2012.
Jack and Eli were trainees #2 and #1, respectively, and they helped me build the facility we have today in Seattle. We’ve got a long way to go, but without their support and devotion to hard training – which wasn’t always fun – I wouldn’t have been able to sublease my own place and create an affordable and solid place for committed athletes to train.
Jack and Eli (with his customary half gallon of whole milk)
Thanks, guys.

3 Great Ways to Increase Shoulder Strength and Flexibility - Driveline Baseball,2011-06-01T22:00:06+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/06/3-great-ways-to-increase-shoulder-strength-and-flexibility/,"Shoulder integrity is vitally important for baseball pitchers and batters alike. Sadly, as Eric Cressey pointed out, there’s plenty of athletes out there doing some terrible stretches for their shoulders with the idea that the looser their arms get, the better.
Forced ER Stretch
We would never advocate the above stretch unless there was a very specific reason to do so. Oddly enough, we have such a case at our facility – a former professional pitcher who pitched on an Olympic national team with multiple shoulder surgeries has very limited throwing shoulder ER as a result of  those surgeries and a very long layoff from throwing. We’ll use this stretch for him, gradually increasing the intensity, but we won’t use it habitually like many pro guys will. Eric described pro guys getting their shoulders cranked back – imitating that peel-back mechanism – twice per day, every day! This is madness.
Enough digression, though. Let’s go to the list…
Plenty of examples of great resistance band exercises can be found on our YouTube channel, including this tethered resistance band cycle:
[youtube qQjf3KB0CBk nolink]
It’s important that you use the resistance band cycle appropriately – scale it back during the season, as you don’t want to have a ton of direct rotator cuff work during a competition season. You’re already likely throwing a ton of bullpens, long toss, and pitching in games, so use it sparingly. Getting a light resistance band and using it to warm up and do some scapular pull-aparts is a perfect addition to a pre-game routine.
Light SPRI Band
The TRX Suspension Trainer is a great way to add some multiplanar pulling exercises to increase shoulder integrity, strength, and stability. Here’s a sample video of what we often do with it – the reverse fly to pull-apart:
[youtube KiXhJhjIajI nolink]
If the TRX is a bit pricey, you can pick up the Jungle Gym suspension trainer and use it much in the same way we do.
Any reader of this blog knows that we love medball training at our Seattle-based facility, both in the Elite Baseball Training program and for our sport-agnostic clients through Driveline Athletics. There’s a ton of rotational work that you can do that helps build up ballistic strength in the shoulders without imposing rapid elbow extension forces on your body, such as a simple side scoop toss:
[youtube F-8L3lLdMY4 nolink]
You can also do overhead slams, jumping slams, overspeed variants – tons of great circuits you can do with them at varying weights, speeds, and intensities. Check out our YouTube channel for plenty of examples of medball training, and pick up an 8 pound medball as a great all-purpose training tool:
Valeo 8 lb. Medball
Those training tips above show some basic exercises you can immediately implement to help increase the strength, flexibility, and integrity of your shoulders. These are some of the same exercises we use in our Elite Baseball Training program, so get started today and I’m sure you’ll see the benefits!

Is Grip Strength Important for Hitters?,2011-05-17T01:08:44+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/05/is-grip-strength-important-for-hitters/,"Everyone loves grip strength from a general physical preparedness (GPP) standpoint, and why not? It’s used on a daily basis by the majority of us. Moving boxes, hoisting furniture, opening jars of peanut butter, opening stuck doors, and so on. But does it matter when it comes to swinging a bat?
Eric Hosmer’s Swing
Many people believe that the strength of the forearms and grip matter at ball/bat collision – the stronger your grip on the bat, the more solid your contact will be. Unfortunately, this view is flawed. It has been debunked by the vast majority of people who study swing mechanics like Dr. Chris Yeager, Jack Mankin, Dr. Robert Adair, and even the guys on the ESPN show Sport Science. Simply put, the bat is ballistic at contact, meaning that if you could release the bat just before bat/ball collision, you would have no effect on the outcome of the hit. The reverberations that are caused by contact do not reach your hands before the ball’s surface leaves the surface of the bat.
Well… not quite. Like everything in athletics, swinging a bat for optimal performance relies on efficient use of the kinetic chain. This means proper force application/generation technique from the ground up, from proximal to distal, largest to smallest body segments.
In layman’s terms, this means using the legs to power the hips, which turn the shoulders, which launch the arms, wrists, hands, and finally the baseball bat to contact. Leg, hip, and core strength matter the most – they will contribute the vast majority of the bat’s launch speed when timed correctly.
However, a break in the kinetic chain or weakness in a link of the kinetic chain will cause an inefficient transfer of power from segment to segment. This is where good forearm strength comes into play.
A good way to determine if (and how much) something matters is to take two extremes. For forearm/grip strength, let’s assume we have the world champion of arm wrestling against someone with a broken ulna bone. That’s a pretty good continuum. The guy with ultimate forearm strength is going to be able to transfer close to 100% of the power generated by the legs and core to the bat assuming he uses perfect bat swing mechanics. The guy with the broken ulna will not, for reasons that should be obvious.
This argument is very similar to the one we use when discussing why you should train the decelerator muscles when it comes to throwing a ball. Building a bigger engine (legs/core) is unusable if the brakes (posterior shoulder muscles) or transmission (forearms in the case of a bat swing) cannot appropriately handle the load imposed on them.
The engine drives the car, and so it’s important to work the muscles that contribute the most to the swing’s speed. But it’s also important to work the smaller muscles that stabilize the bat and transfer power down the barrel of the bat as well. Again, there’s a catch – simply training the grip using methods like squeezing a tennis ball over and over again doesn’t really help and is a pretty inefficient use of your time. What’s the best way to train the grip and the muscles that contribute the most bat speed?
Deadlifts, of course!
So get in the gym, do your heavy deadlifts, and we bet you’ll see a big increase in bat speed, grip strength, and the manliness of your hands. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, you’ll need to start doing deadlifts to find out on your own.
fuck you. grip strength is DA SHIT!!
Sounds convincing, but your analysis dismissed the weight of the bat and the inertia it will develop. Plus the impluse of energy created by the legs and midsection , can’t be transferred with  to the bat without an extremely high level of coupling between the hands and the bat. Once this is satisfied we have your ballistic condition that was made possible by strong hands …

DIY Glute-Ham Raise / Back Extension Setup - Driveline Baseball,2011-04-27T20:30:34+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/04/diy-glute-ham-raise-back-extension-setup/,"As anyone who knows me can attest, I love DIY projects in a gym. Commercial equipment is just too expensive for what it is, especially specialized pieces of gear that are useful for assistance/accessory exercises. I have no problem spending a few hundred bucks on a nice barbell or power cage, but stuff like Glute-Ham Raises or Back Extension setups can run several hundred dollars.
We modified our power cage with a crappy chrome barbell, water pool noodle, 200 pounds of plates, an orange EliteFTS resistance band, and a standard flat bench to create a GHR / Back Extension setup (click for full size):
You lay prone on the bench, pin your legs under the padded bar, and do back extensions with your arms across your chest. You can load it up by putting an EZ-curl bar behind your neck (one of the few acceptable uses for this bar in our facility), or you can grab the resistance band attached to the chin-up bar to provide resistance going down and assistance coming up.
As someone who is rehabbing a likely stress fracture in his lumbar spine (don’t worry, it’s nothing too bad), this setup has helped me a lot.
We just need to keep the padding away from people who would like to use it in their squats. It’s acceptable for use in the GHR / Back Extension setup and push pressing, but not much else. Remember, folks: Friends don’t let friends use the pad when squatting.

You Fail Because You Don't Practice (Or Know How to Practice) - Driveline Baseball,2011-04-26T03:47:21+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/04/you-fail-because-you-dont-practice-or-know-how-to-practice/,"As someone who runs a training facility in Seattle with three batting cages attached to it, I’m in a unique position to see hoards of people coming in to “practice” with their high school, college, select, or Little League teams. Every single team practice I’ve seen has been a complete failure. Yes, every single one. The general outline of a team practice goes like this:
Well, they just wasted an hour of their lives for a very marginal training effect (if any). Simply taking a ton of hacks or throwing off a mound isn’t going to get you anywhere. That’s not practice. That’s babysitting.
Real practice is deliberate. It means multiple short-term goals that make up a larger goal with specific achievements along the way. Practice as we know it is nothing more than a bad conditioning effect and a hobby. Yet we have the audacity to wonder why American talent is quickly becoming outpaced by Dominican, Puerto Rican, and other foreign competitors in Major League Baseball?
The truth is that we all know what real practice is – just like we know how to lose fat and add muscle. The problem, of course, is that it’s not fun, it’s very hard, and it’s boring.
Well, duh.
I understand that taking rounds of batting practice mashing middle-of-the-plate meatballs at 65 MPH with your metal bat is a lot of fun. You get to show off to your teammates, parents, and girlfriends, purporting to be a decent hitter. Or maybe you throw your pitches off a mound and wow your catcher with your fastball velocity and the break of your slider you learned last year. Yeah, that’s fun. But you’re not learning anything.
The key to success is deliberate practice. This has been outlined in many talent research books like Talent is Overrated, Outliers, and The Talent Code, just to name a few. In nearly all studies done on the “best performers” in a given discipline, they found that the statistically significant variable that matters the most is deliberate practice. Not some innate talent or genetic gifts, but rather good old fashioned hard work.
Talent Is Overrated
In Talent is Overrated, Geoff Colvin outlines the deliberate practice and furious pace that so-called virtuosos displayed – Mozart and Tiger Woods, specifically. Tiger was playing full rounds of golf at age 3 and put in thousands of hours before he even hit high school. Genetically gifted? Maybe. Expert due to countless hours of hard work with a very specific purpose in mind? Definitely.
Translating Deliberate Practice to Baseball
There’s one major thing you can do to become a better baseball player, regardless of position: You can videotape yourself. By taping yourself swinging a bat or throwing your best fastball, you can compare your mechanics to the best in the world and see how you match up. Chances are good that you don’t; not even close. Here’s the second biggest problem with training Americans: They have big egos and are taught at a young age that they are special. Well, I have bad news for you: You aren’t. Everyone has to put in a ton of hard work to reach the ultimate goal: Playing in the big leagues in front of tens of thousands of fans.
The end goals can be reached by those without supreme genetic gifts – just look at baseball athletes like David Eckstein, Dustin Pedroia, and Tim Collins – but you aren’t going to get there without busting your ass.
Here’s part of a typical practice that our pitchers will go through at Driveline Baseball in the off-season:

Dynamic warm-up (foam rolling, self-myofascial release, movement prep)
Throwing-specific warm-up (incrementing intensity over various throwing drills)
Arm action optimization (throwing at 100% off flat ground into a net)
Video review
Arm action optimization
Video review
Arm action optimization
Video review
Strength training (barbell lifts)
Rotational power development (medicine ball work)
Metabolic conditioning

Nothing about this is fun, save for gains the pitcher gets in his fastball velocity. He will throw standard or under/overloaded baseballs off flat ground while being taped at 30 FPS and 210 FPS for review. We’ll talk about the arm action, compare it to professionals, and repeat. After enough trials of this (typically three in a given session), we’ll move on to general strength/power development. This is something that is done every week when developing amateur talent, and the pitchers who have the best work ethic will be in the facility at least four times in a given week.
A typical high school pitcher who wants to compete at the college level will need to be in my facility four times per week, following a good diet, training his ass off for about three years. I wouldn’t dare to say that this is “hard work” – the minute you start to think you work hard, just look at what Dominican kids do to make their dreams come true. The truth is that it’s hard enough to find dedicated kids who will show up four times per week to work out in the off-season to even give their lofty dreams a shot. Most would rather play MLB The Show on their PS3 and dream about having god-given fastball velocity.
Why You Fail: You Don’t Want to Succeed
If you don’t compete at the level you want to, it’s easy to blame it on exogenous factors – I’m not genetically gifted, I have to balance work/school with training, the facility I train at is too far away, and other “good” excuses. Just admit it to yourself: You don’t want to succeed. You don’t want to put in the thousands of hours necessary to even get a shot at the higher levels of baseball, because the very real possibility of failure. You aren’t alone.
But at Driveline Baseball, we have an athlete who was a former top prep outfielder in Seattle playing at one of the best schools in the area. He failed to make the cut at the University of Washington because he spiraled into drug and alcohol use. He lost two years of training time and gave up on his dream – playing Division-I baseball and getting a shot in the pros. He currently has a kid, a long-term girlfriend, is still enrolled in school full-time while working a job, and came to me a few months ago saying that he was dedicated to playing professionally again.
He’s been in the facility four times per week training hard and earned a spot on the Everett Merchants, a local semi-pro / summer team. He has JUCO schools recruiting him to play center field, but he’s going to play a year of summer ball and train hard to see if he can play D-I baseball again. And from there, who knows?
Tell him that you don’t have the time to train hard because of school, or because you’re out of shape, or because you have too much going on in your life. Good luck with that.

Product Recommendation: VS Athletics Weightlifting Shoes - Driveline Baseball,2011-04-01T01:06:32+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/03/product-recommendation-vs-athletics-weightlifting-shoes/,"I own a pair of VS Athletics Dynamo Weightlifting shoes, and I get a ton of use out of them. I wear them while squatting, deadlifting, power cleaning, and yes, even benching. They have a slightly raised non-compressible heel that allows for good leg drive through the floor. And best of all, they were cheap compared to the alternatives, coming in at around $80! I bought my pair last year and they’ve lasted with no problems.
Well, today I found out that VS Athletics is selling them for $39! This is an unbelievable price. At $80 they’re a great investment – at $39, they are a must-buy.
I get no affiliate kickbacks out of this, and the only business I’ve done with VS Athletics in the past is simply buying a pair of their Dynamos and recommending them to everyone else. The size runs true to standard sneaker size, so no weird adjustments need to be made.
Buy a pair today!

Lack of Fitness: In-Season Programming Gone Wrong - Driveline Baseball,2011-03-28T22:00:23+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/03/lack-of-fitness-in-season-programming-gone-wrong/,"In-season programming for baseball athletes is a tricky subject. Eric Cressey has written a lot about the subject as of late, and I highly recommend you check it out. But I wanted to tackle some of the specific cases we’ve seen in our facility lately, and show how in-season programming can be a tough nut to crack – especially while navigating around injuries and illness.
Two of our baseball athletes have missed significant time at the beginning of their high school baseball season due to illness (flu) and injury (stress fracture, left foot). The first problem is totally systemic and very severe; as a result, the athlete just needs to rest and do minor flexibility things without imposing a stress that requires systemic recovery from. The second problem is local; the athlete can do stuff from a kneeling, prone, or supine position to get a training effect without doing major damage to the affected area. However, in both cases, they are facing a big setback right when they should be finishing up the skill acquisition portion of their training cycles (both are two-way players and in their starting rotations – the same team, even).
The second athlete has been playing in his HS games but has struggled on the mound. The velocity has dipped and his control is erratic despite his hitting being completely unaffected (4-5 with two doubles so far). His pitching skill is not where it needs to be, as he missed 2-4 weeks of mound time which would have contributed significantly to his ability to pitch. Additionally, his workout attendance has been erratic as of late due to schoolwork and a out-of-town game trip, and he’s been suffering an “overuse” injury to his throwing arm. We talked about it for a bit today, and it’s pretty clear that his “injury” is a lack of fitness problem – he has been underworked, not overworked! He’s not getting the flexibility/mobility work in for the muscles that control the scapula, and his maintenance strength training has been somewhat neglected. What he has been doing a lot of is throwing in practice, and this balance has been upset as a result.
Eric put it very well when he said:
If a young athlete pitches fewer than three innings per week, though, we just train him like we would a position player, but try to make sure that at least one of these training sessions comes the day after throwing.  I like this approach because it not only “consolidates” stress into a 24-hour block to allow for better recovery, but it also forces a kid to go through his mobility drills and manual stretching with us to “normalize” his range of motion after a throwing appearance.
We treat our short appearance pitchers very much the same way, though it depends on the level of advancement of the athlete. If we have a HS Varsity pitcher who threw 3 submaximal innings in a game on Monday, and he comes in on Tuesday, what we do depends very heavily on how hard he throws and how advanced he is as an athlete. The 6’0″ 190 lbs junior who throws 79-81 MPH with little strength training can be exposed to a heavier workload – including medball work and throwing-specific work – than the 5’11” 195 lbs senior who is sitting 89-90 MPH, has a 300 lb 1RM Squat, and a 360 lb 1RM deadlift with a college scholarship on the line!
Like many things in this industry, it’s a continuum – this one is based around training status of the pitcher in question. The more skilled/highly trained the athlete is, the less stress we want to impose on him in a consolidated block of training stimulus – and vice versa. This is a concept that goes largely ignored, and is even reversed by most baseball coaches! They think that youth athletes should be babied while the older guys can handle more workload – and while that’s true in a vacuum, they don’t realize that an appearance in a game by the older guy who is further along the training continuum is taxed more heavily by his game workload!
SPRI Xertube Resistance Band – Medium
It’s important to get in your training when you can – pulling your resistance bands for mobility/flexibility work and foam rolling on a regular basis is critical, but it’s also necessary to get maintenance (or even slight incremental) strength/speed training in where you can.
Care to talk about rest/recuperation time with the body in general, not just after injury?  I cite two points here: first, I trained for a while using H.I.T training, specifically a precise version of the “Super Slo Mo” protocol.  I did find that once I could get my head to stop quitting on me, I could completely exhaust myself and need a solid week to recover for all major muscle groups (compound movements were mostly used [pulldowns, squats, pull-overs, etc]). Likewise, we frequently see athletes who are forced to take time off to recover from injury, come back even stronger (for a while).  Clearly, if the stress placed on the body is high enough, recuperation time is always too short in the professional sports world, where there isn’t sufficient time off, in my opinion, when forces and stresses are high enough. The elbow and shoulder of a pitcher come to mind.  And during Super Slo Mo, I was reducing force by reducing velocity (F=MA), but pitchers of course do not.  Your thoughts?  Thank you! –Steve Gardner CPT
Yes, that’s a tough subject, Steve. I’m not a fan of HIT/SSM for any athlete (or weekend warrior) for a lot of reasons, but that is probably something else to discuss.
Training heavy twice per week for most in-season athletes to maintain strength is a good general guide. If the athlete is approaching the intermediate plateaus, doing two full-body workouts per week after competition is the best way to approach things so you can consolidate stressors in a short window. Nutrition will play a big part here – getting enough carbs pre-workout and protein/fats post-workout will be huge.

Olympic Lifts for Baseball Players - Is Power Planar? - Driveline Baseball,2011-03-16T20:15:24+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/03/olympic-lifts-for-baseball-players-is-power-planar/,"While there aren’t any Olympic lifts in our first training video (as seen in the right sidebar), our older baseball athletes do perform the power clean as a staple in their barbell training program. Recently there have been a few articles on the Internet discussing the validity and usefulness of Olympic lifts for baseball players, particularly pitchers. A lot of coaches and trainers contend that power is bound to the plane you are performing the movement in, and as such, the Olympic lifts are bad choices for baseball athletes.
What do we mean by “planes,” anyway?
Human Anatomy Planes
The power clean operates almost entirely in the sagittal plane, as do maximum vertical leap attempts. Baseball pitching and hitting, on the other hand, are largely transverse and coronal movements (think: trunk and pelvic rotation). So why would we train for power in the sagittal plane? Or even train at all in the sagittal plane?
This is a situation where sport-specificity gets taken way too far. You have to step back for a second and realize that a proper training program will adequately separate general physiological training and sport-specific training. Squats and deadlifts operate primarily in the sagittal plane as well. Should we omit them from a proper baseball player’s training regimen? Absolutely not.
Power cleans train Rate of Force Development very well and help the athlete to develop a better sense for creating optimal ground reaction forces through the “jump” in the second pull of the movement. Power cleans are not meant to be a sport-specific training stimulus but rather a general physiological training stimulus. Simply replacing them with lateral bounding (coronal plane) and broad jumping (sagittal plane) methods ignores half of the reason we train – to be generally more powerful, strong, and athletic!
Movements that operate largely in the general physiological realm of stimuli are not bad, just as movements that operate largely in the sport-specific realm of stimuli are not bad. In fact, you have to be careful when the two overlap, because this is where you can run into some mechanical confusion! For example, take weighted (overload) baseballs. If you stay within 10-20% of the original weight of the baseball (5 ounces), you don’t meaningfully affect the standard biomechanical patterns of a baseball thrower’s mechanics. This would largely be a sport-specific training stimulus. However, as you stray from this boundary, you start to alter the biomechanical pattern of a standard baseball throw and start moving across the continuum towards a general physiological training stimulus. But since the movement is still a “throw,” you are getting fairly fuzzy with the training stimulus. As a result, you might be training the body to do something in a less efficient or less optimal manner due to the biomechanical changes you are imposing on the standard mechanics of the movement. This is why you see most of our very heavy baseball throws (2 pounds, for example) done with partial movements or constrained situations (pitcher kneeling, for example).
[youtube mU1tboJggTQ nolink]
There are plenty of reasons why you’d want to intentionally alter the standard biomechanical patterns of a movement, however. A flaw in a pitcher’s arm action can be exposed with an overload baseball in limited action to help the pitcher understand the changes he needs to make. But with a pitcher who has a generally decent arm action, you wouldn’t use these tools for fear of altering his throwing motion in a negative way.
Always remember the continuum of general physiological training to sport-specific training. It exists in all sports, and movements on both ends typically have a lot of merit to them. Just remember when crossing the continuum to be careful not to alter the standard movement patterns of an athlete – unless you want this change to occur!
‘The power clean operates almost entirely in the transverse plane’
How so?

Interview with UMD Pitcher Ben Brewster - Driveline Baseball,2011-03-06T04:00:32+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/03/interview-with-umd-pitcher-ben-brewster/,"Ben Brewster
Ben Brewster is a left-handed pitcher on the University of Maryland’s baseball team, where he earned his spot by dominating his senior year of high school at The Park School. Ben recorded 88 strikeouts over 42.2 innings while walking only 11 guys and allowing just 3 earned runs his whole season. It didn’t come easily, though – Ben was a soft-tossing lefty as a sophomore in high school and trained his ass off to get to where he is today.
It’s a pretty long interview, so it’s split up into two parts. Be sure to read through it all!
Kyle Boddy (KB): Let’s start this interview by talking a little bit about where you’re playing baseball now.
Ben Brewster (BB): Sure. I actually came to Maryland unsure about whether or not I’d be playing baseball here. I was sidelined for most of my junior year of high school with a back injury, and as a result missed out on a lot of recruiting opportunities. I ended up deciding on Maryland because of the in state tuition, academic scholarships and #3 ranked kinesiology undergrad program. I ended up having a pretty good spring and decided to sign up for the June recruiting camp at Maryland. I pitched well and was offered a spot on the team after throwing 3 innings at the camp.
For me, there’s nothing more exciting than being a part of the team that redefines what Maryland baseball is all about, which from this point on will be winning. There are some great young and energetic coaches here fully dedicated to making all of us players the best that we can be. It’s been an entirely positive experience so far and every bit what I’d hoped college baseball would be.
KB: In June 2007 as a high school sophomore, you were throwing low-70’s. Today, you’re in the mid-80’s with your best bolt and pitching Division-I baseball in a tough conference. Mechanically, did you make any major changes?
BB: Freshman year of high school I didn’t really pay any attention to mechanics or conditioning my body.  I was about 6’1” 150lbs and throwing maybe 73 on my absolute best fastball. I began to work on my mechanics a bit, but didn’t really know what I was doing. I also began to weight train, though I was equally clueless about what I was doing. Nonetheless, I persevered and somehow managed to get up to 6’2” 165lbs by the next year, hitting 81 mph from my near-sidearm delivery.
The summer before my junior year I decided that the awkward, jerky sidearm delivery I had would ultimately limit my potential. I decided that if I wanted to be successful I had to eventually throw 95 mph, and I certainly wouldn’t throw 95 from that arm slot.
I began to completely obsess over reworking each piece of my mechanics starting with the arm action and working backwards down the kinetic chain. To give you an idea, I spent 3 months doing arm action drills just to make sure my arm action was perfect. I video taped hundreds of throws, I radar gunned… and I was making progress… in a sense.
On the one hand, I had improved tenfold in many of the isolated drills I was practicing. I could snap throw 70-75 mph without moving my feet or turning my shoulders. That kind of velocity is just stupid for a drill like that, but I began to notice something. The more pieces of the delivery that I incorporated, the more I struggled to put everything together. From power position type drills without a lifting the front foot I could throw 82 mph, and yet both on the mound and with a running crow hop I struggled to consistently hit 83 mph (hit 85 mph on occasion).
What I failed to realize was that a lot of the drills I’d been doing worked in isolation but failed to carry over to the full delivery. Most 90 mph throwers probably couldn’t snap throw 75 mph like I could, and yet, I was the one who struggled to bring any appreciable velocity from the mound. What I needed was to spend more time just throwing and less time on drills.
My senior year was coming up so I decided to keep things as simple as possible – I’d pitch from a slide step and only out of the stretch. After all, the windup doesn’t really have much purpose and most pitchers can throw just as hard from a slide step if they load the hips right.
I started out the season in that 81-83 range, hitting 85, and by the end of the season had become comfortable enough with my mechanics that I was sitting 83-85 hitting 87 mph once or twice.
My mechanics regressed a little bit over the summer, and this past fall I underwent some arm action changes that led to my arm slot dropping a little below sidearm. These changes led to a drop in velocity, although I actually experienced some pretty good success against hitters from the angle. Recently, the pitching coach and I are working on raising my arm slot back up to slightly above sidearm and working on having both a slide step and a leg lift delivery. This appears to have my velocity back in the mid 80s, and that will undoubtedly improve as I get more comfortable with the higher leg lift.
KB: We all know that mechanics and technique can only take you so far. You’ve gone from a “lanky” 6’1″ 150-pound pitcher to a “big” guy at about 210 pounds at virtually the same height! What have you done in the weight room and on the kitchen table to make this happen?
BB: First off, I can’t take credit for the 60 lb gain over 4 years – that would be ludicrous. I grew about 2 inches over this time, and untrained, would probably be around 6’3” 170lbs currently. Still, I will take credit for about 40lbs of that, about half of which was gained over this past September thru December.
My lifting progress was painfully slow compared to what it should have been in the beginning. First off, I had thought it would be a good idea to run cross country in the fall my freshman year, and so I stuck to that commitment the fall of my sophomore year as well. I began weight training the summer before my sophomore year, and following a good program too (WS4SBIII by Joe Defranco – a 4 day upper/lower max effort/dynamic split). There were so many mistakes that I made, but the biggest ones were that I didn’t know how to do a lot of the exercises with good form, I didn’t know anything about post-workout nutrition, I didn’t realize workouts were not supposed to exceed 60 minutes, and most importantly, I got nowhere near as many overall calories as I needed.
I actually thought it was a halfway decent idea to strength train for baseball and train for the cross-country season simultaneously, so I would do a few distance runs a week and also bike to and from the gym each day, which was about 12 miles round trip. Little did I realize my goals were completely opposing one another. (Sound familiar? –Kyle) So my piece of advice #1 would be pick a single goal or focus and follow it, don’t try to work towards 5 different things at once in your training.
This leads nicely into my next piece of advice, which is that you can’t bulk and also stay lean at the same time in an efficient manner. Any strength coach will tell you this, and I can speak to it now from my own experience as well. Still, there is this fear among what defranco calls the “skinny bastards” that they are going to get fat and lose their abs if they bulk up. The best thing I ever did for my strength was to forget about this notion and just go absolutely apeshit with my nutrition plan, tracking my calories and making sure I did whatever it took to stay on pace to add 1-2lbs a week of bodyweight.
Before, I would try to make sure everything I ate was super clean and just not eat or skip a meal if I wasn’t able to get “clean” food. Sure, I stayed lean, but I also didn’t get big or gain any appreciable amount of weight. Bulking can be relatively clean, but you’re fooling yourself if you think that you can gain 20 lbs on a college meal plan and not put on a few pounds of fat.
The general rule of bulking, in my experience, is that if you aren’t gaining that 1-2 lbs per week, you’re not eating enough. If you’re gaining more than 2 lbs a week, you’re eating too much and going to be putting on excess fat. For most guys who are on a rigorous training schedule, this means shooting for somewhere in the 3,500-5,000 calories/day range. 4,000 calories was plenty for me to gain weight when I weighed under 200lbs, but now I need to take in quite a bit more than that to continue gaining weight on my current training schedule.
KB: I know you are a firm believer in long toss. Can you tell us a bit about your long toss program and how it has changed over the years?
BB: I’ve always believed in the theory behind long toss, but hadn’t actually followed a structured long toss program before this year. One of the great things about long toss is the instant feedback you get – that you can see how far the ball traveled and have an idea of how efficient that throw was. I did a lot of my structured max effort throwing in high school during the offseason using a tripod radar gun, which offered similar direct feedback. You could say we long tossed during the high school season, but it wasn’t true long toss. We had about 5-10 minutes to throw before practice and most guys went out to 120 feet or so.
At Maryland we long toss about 2 times per week, and I’ve seen some pretty good gains on this program. I’ve been able to work out to 300+ feet on my best days (approximately a 90 mph throw) and eventually hope to be able to see similar velocities from the mound. To give you an idea of where I hope to be a year from now: 87-89 mph hitting 90 mph from a sidearm- low ¾ arm slot.
The keys of the program are basically to listen to your arm and move out slowly until you reach your max distance, then move back in at whatever rate your arm is telling you, keeping the same intensity from that max distance throw on each rep. Finish from 60 feet with your best bolt, trying to throw the ball through your partner’s glove.
KB: What other “unorthodox” training methods have you experimented with, and what have the results been? Have you thrown weighted baseballs or done advanced xpxlyometricxx work?
BB: In the grand scheme of things, I’m still a novice trainee. I’ve only been training seriously for about 4 years and haven’t had much of a need to fool around with “advanced” training protocols. I’m only now beginning to approach what I consider an intermediate level of strength and fitness.
I’ve thrown weighted balls before, and I actually feel there is a lot of benefit to be had there. I personally stayed in the 4-9oz ball weight range, and I didn’t feel comfortable throwing anything heavier than the 7oz ball from my full delivery. Still, the weighted balls have two main benefits in my experience. The first is that they “teach” you how to put more effort into your throws. For example, it’s typical if you gun a player throwing a 5 oz ball, then gun him throwing a 6 or 7 oz ball, and then have that player throw the 5oz ball again he will have picked up a couple mph just by learning how to apply more intent to his throws.
The second benefit to weighted balls are that they “clean up” your arm action, for lack of a better term. If a player pushes a 5 oz ball or has a weird hitch in his arm action, or whatever, those inefficiencies are going to be exaggerated when the player increases the weight of the ball. This idea applies to a lot of things – sloppy form or inefficiencies in a movement pattern are revealed when the load increases. You may be able to round your back and get away with it in a 135lb deadlift, but if you try to deadlift with that kind of form with 400lbs on the bar, the inefficiency in your movement pattern will be exaggerated.
KB: What goals are you setting for yourself through 2011? How about through the end of your collegiate career?
BB: I would like to be a Javier Lopez or Brian Fuentes type of pitcher – 88-90 mph sidearm delivery with a hard slider and a sinking/cutting changeup. I’m also aiming to be able to command all three pitches in any count. Some lifting goals that I hope to meet by the end of my college career: 38 inch vertical jump (34 currently), 220lbs bodyweight (210 currently) and <10% body fat (in the 10- 12% range currently), 450lb back squat (380lb 1RM currently), 275lb hang clean (235lb 1RM currently- no straps), chin-up 3RM +80 lbs (+55lbs currently).

What it Takes to Compete at the Highest Level - Strength Training! - Driveline Baseball,2011-02-24T04:25:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/02/what-it-takes-to-compete-at-the-highest-level-strength-training/,"My business partner sent me a pretty interesting link – The Average Mariner May Surprise You. Consider this:
How big? The team wrapped up their physicals earlier this week and some of the data is in. The average height and weight for the Mariners? 6’3″, 226 pounds. For the visual, the closest to average, I repeat average, is Felix Hernandez.
…
“Without a doubt,” Zduriencik answered when asked if this club’s physical makeup was an indicator of the direction he wanted to go in putting together his organization. “The one thing that I thought was important, and I said it to all of our guys, is we need to get physical. Obviously you need baseball players and you need athletes and there are certain positions on the field where size is going to be what it is but I believe that physical players, that guys when you come in and look at this group and go, ‘Hmm. OK, I see it,’ I think it is a reflection of what we are trying to do.”
Zduriencik stressed to me that they are not just going after size, but athletes as well, and it goes beyond signing. It has to be developed.
Great stuff here in this interview, and there’s plenty more, so go give Shannon’s blog a read.
Eric Cressey and Kevin Youkilis were featured in a NESN video this week as well, detailing their off-season workout protocols:
What do you see Kevin doing in the video?
And yet, as I detailed in My Beef with Select Team Training, I see so-called “advanced” teams forbidding weight training and recommending long distance running instead. They tell their kids not to “get too tight” by lifting weights and that “being too big” is a problem.
Well, as Shannon pointed out, the average Mariner in Spring Training is the size of Felix Hernandez at 6’3″ 226 pounds. Kevin Youkilis is listed at 6’1″ 220 lbs, which conveniently enough is as big as I am. (You probably won’t find me at first or third base for the Red Sox, though.)
The truth of the matter is that athletes in high school and college need to be strong and train properly to mitigate injury risk and to get their best out of their bodies. Professional teams look for these factors when they’re projecting guys – they want to know someone has the work ethic required to make it at the next level. Your body has to be strong enough to endure 150+ games on the road, in a bus, usually with subpar nutritional offerings for days, even weeks, at a time.
If you play select-level baseball and take batting practice 2-3 times per week and field grounders or throw bullpens, you can find time to train in the weight room for three sessions to increase your power, strength, speed, and agility. If you’re interested in looking like and training like professional athletes, that is.

A Hypothetical Training Question... - Driveline Baseball,2011-02-22T09:29:43+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/02/a-hypothetical-training-question/,"The current state of baseball training in the Seattle area is getting to me. I’ve thought long and hard about this, and we’re changing our business model shortly – little to no private training and moving entirely to low-cost semi-private training. However, there’s something I’d like to ask our readership in Seattle: Would you be interested in this training program?
Price: Whatever you’re willing to pay.
Yes, seriously. I am considering opening it up to anyone and letting you dictate what the cost will be. I will disclose how much it costs to run my operations and you can pay me what you think it is worth.
However, there is a catch: If you habitually miss workouts, you are fired as a client. Oh, and you need to be either going into high school next year or already enrolled in HS/College somewhere.
I basically want to know how serious some people are in Seattle. Do you want to add fastball velocity, pounds to your squat, increase your bat speed, cut your 60 time, and become an awesome athlete? Are you dedicated and want to work your ass off to make it happen?
Driveline Baseball: Weight Room
If so, let me know. If there’s sufficient interest, I’ll select the candidates that sound like they want to work hard and we’ll hold an initial training session and meeting to see if it’s a good fit.
Contact us today if you want to work hard. I want to make the opportunity available to everyone who wants it badly, regardless of income level and previous training status.

Velocity Development Program: Strength and Power - Driveline Baseball,2011-02-07T23:20:45+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/02/velocity-development-program-strength-and-power/,"(This is the second in a series of posts detailing the Velocity Development Program at Driveline Baseball.)
As we talked about in the Throwing portion of the Velocity Development Program, adding velocity to your fastball and becoming a better baseball athlete is simple. But not easy.
Back Squat
Throwing a baseball at maximal velocities predominantly involves the ability to generate a large amount of speed-strength. Speed-strength is the ability to produce high amounts of power very quickly, and to train for it, you must train on both ends of the absolute speed / absolute strength continuum. Today, we’ll focus mostly on the absolute strength portion, but we’ll slide into the middle of that spectrum – training for power.
Athletes participating in the Velocity Development Program at Driveline Baseball all train for strength using a variety of implements, including barbells, dumbbells, and regular bodyweight exercises. Strength is binary – it is the answer to the question “Did I move this heavy object that is producing a resistance force of X?” It is not so-called “functional strength” which is popular in today’s personal training groups. There is nothing “functional” and nothing “safer” by doing BOSU ball squats, lunges, or “unstable surface training.” These movements might be good for rehabilitation purposes, but lower extremity instability training has very little (and almost no) carryover to regular athletic movements in healthy populations. So if your trainer or coach is recommending you do unweighted lunges, squats, or even throw baseballs off an unstable disc because it “works more muscles,” you know you need to look elsewhere.
Ball Squat – Safe and Functional?
Strength plays a large role in deceleration immediately after throwing a baseball – humeral internal rotation velocities can reach (or exceed) 7,500 degrees/sec, and simply pulling lightweight resistance bands and doing stretching isn’t going to cut it. Developing the musculature that supports the posterior shoulder girdle will help to protect connective tissue and increase velocity as well!
Here’s an analogy I like to use all the time: Imagine that you’re going to race a car against another car in a straight line over a quarter-mile distance. What features do you want that car to have? An engine capable of producing high torque and horsepower, for sure. Good tires to get traction on the ground and launch quickly, too. Perhaps a stiff suspension to transmit force properly throughout the chassis. But what if I told you this race had a cliff at the end of the quarter-mile track? All of a sudden, what features do you want the car to have? Now you’re interested in the braking system of the car! If the car has an elite braking system, then you can go faster before slamming the brakes to stop yourself from plummeting over that cliff. And if the car has terrible brakes, then it doesn’t really matter how powerful the engine is, now does it?
The body works the same way through a series of proprioceptive feedback mechanisms. This can immediately be evidenced with a heavy barbell deadlift: Even if a lifter’s legs, trunk, and core are capable of lifting the heavy barbell off the ground, if his grip is weak, it will not budge off the ground a single inch. His grip might be strong enough to carry it to 1/8 lockout, but his brain knows that the grip isn’t going to do what he wants it to do, so the bar doesn’t move at all. Your body’s deceleration muscles (mainly the posterior shoulder muscles and posterior chain) work in a similar fashion – you need to train it properly to unlock your best fastball velocities.
Read more about power after the jump…
Power is simply the rate at which work is performed. So if you squat 200 pounds in 1.0 seconds and later squat 210 pounds in that same 1.0 seconds, you’ve generated more power in the second lift attempt. It goes without saying that increasing your strength directly impacts the ability to generate power, which is linked to creating speed-strength in athletes.
Focusing on developing power works very well for most athletes – creating faster bar speed in barbell lifts like the squat, bench press, press, deadlift, and power clean help stimulate the central nervous system (CNS) in ways that typical absolute strength training doesn’t.
Enough talk – here’s some videos of Driveline Baseball athletes demonstrating some strength and power exercises.

Strength training is often confused with weight and power lifting which are both discouraged by medical and fitness professionals for young athletes.
Oh really? The subject matter expert on the topic is Dr. Avery Faigenbaum. What does he have to say about strength training for youth athletes?
StrongKid.com was founded by Dr. Avery Faigenbaum in 2001 to dispel the myths associated with youth strength training and provide reassurance that regular strength exercise can be safe, effective and enjoyable for boys and girls provided that age-appropriate training guidelines are followed.
In Relative Safety of Weightlifting for Youth (PDF), Dr. Faigenbaum says:
If you want to learn more, you can read Dr. Avery Faigenbaum’s work at strongkid.com, or Google his name and find all the work he’s done in the field.
Despite all this publicly-available information on weightlifting being safe and useful for youth athletes, so-called “elite” baseball training programs still live in the dark ages and don’t prepare their athletes for success in the best ways possible. The aforementioned baseball training facility that thinks that weightlifting is “discouraged by medical and fitness professionals” is considered one of the “best” places to train in the greater Seattle area. It blows my mind that people don’t do a modicum of research to clearly disprove this absurd statement.
Moving on…
At a scientific meeting, the following results of a study were published:
METHODS: Thirty-seven members of an NCAA Division I men’s baseball team (age =19.7 ± 1.3 yr) volunteered to be evaluated. Tests included percent body fat, lean body mass (LBM), grip strength, upper (1RM bench press and 1-arm dumbbell row) and lower body (1RM squat) strength, rotational power (medicine ball side toss), leg power (vertical jump), running speed (10, 30, 60 yd sprint), throwing velocity (TV), bat velocity (BV), and batted-ball velocity (BBV).
RESULTS: Correlation coefficients were calculated for all variables by utilizing a correlation matrix from raw scores. Significant (p < 0.05) and moderately high positive relationships were indicated between BV and BBV (r = 0.70); 60 yd sprint and 30 yd sprint (r = 0.77), 10 yd sprint (r = 0.70). Significant and moderately positive relationships were indicated between BV and vertical jump (r = 0.58), LBM (r = 0.43); medicine ball side toss and BV (r = 0.50), TV (r = 0.49), BBV (r = 0.45); 1RM squat and 1RM bench press (r = 0.58). Significant and moderately negative relationships were indicated between 60 yd sprint and vertical jump (r = -0.57). Coefficients of determination for all variables were also calculated. Of particular interest was BV and BBV (r2 = 0.49), vertical jump (r2 = 0.34), medicine ball side toss (r2 = 0.25), LBM (r2 = 0.18); medicine ball side toss and TV (r2 = 0.24), BBV (r2 = 0.20); 60 yd sprint and 30 yd sprint (r2 = 0.59), 10 yd sprint (r2 = 0.49), VJ (r2 = -0.32).
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that strength training programs designed to improve baseball player’s performance should emphasize increasing leg power, rotational power, and LBM.
The first thing I noticed was that the r-squared for 60 yd. sprint and vertical jump (VJ) was negative. This is obviously impossible, as anyone who has taken math above an eighth grade level can tell you that a squared real number is never negative. Besides that clear typo, the study tells us what most intelligent people already knew: Baseball players with stronger legs/core throw a ball and swing a bat faster.
Of particular interest in the study is the training method that has the highest correlation coefficient with bat velocity: Vertical Jump. A cursory Google search will turn up a lot of baseball trainers and theorists (particularly the Dr. Marshall apologists) that think that training vertical leap / broad jump metrics are a waste of time in the name of “sport-specificity.” Yet this study (and many others) show a clear strong relationship between the two variables. Additionally, lean body mass (LBM) has a high correlation coefficent with bat velocity; again, this is not surprising – we know that larger values of LBM are linked to higher throwing velocities in other studies, so this makes sense.
Proficiency in the medicine ball side toss was linked to better performance in bat velocity and throwing velocity – nothing too surprising here.
What was interesting, however, was that 1RM squat strength was not significantly linked to any of the other variables. Though the methods and descriptions of the “squat” were not disclosed, I have reason to believe that the “squat” performed was probably not to parallel and that none of the athletes had significantly trained the movement. My experiences with HS/College baseball show this to be nearly universally true – you can find tons and tons of videos on YouTube of so-called “squats” done by baseball players that are far above parallel, or worse, done on a Smith machine. (It wouldn’t surprise me if the “squat” they used in the study was actually done on a Smith machine; that would clearly invalidate that portion of the research.)
Dick Mills used this study to attempt to disprove the link between weight training and increased performance for baseball athletes, which is particularly hilarious. You can read this exchange on the ASMI message boards if you like. Mills said:
Implication. Some variables usually considered to design strength training programs have minor relationships with performance measures in college baseball players, and have little predictive value.
He actually said this in a way that made it look like the study implied this, when in reality, it implied the exact opposite. He left that part out, though. Weird, eh?
Fortunately, ASMI researcher Dave Fortenbaugh made a clear observation based on the study:
I think if you can explain even 20 to 30 percent of the variance of one performance variable (bat velocity) with a particular exercise, I think that exercise is worth spending some effort on.
It means that we’re training our baseball athletes that generally agrees with the published sport science out there, while many of the other local training facilities are not. Our staff reviews all the relevant and current research out there and spends untold amounts of money on continuing education to stay on top of the game. Does your current coach do this? If not, maybe it’s time to think about switching. Contact us today for a free tour and workout to see if Driveline Baseball‘s training programs are right for you.
Why is a lean pitcher like Lincecum able to throw 90+MPH and a pitcher like Brain Wilson who is way bigger and muscular than him is slightly faster in velocity?  Also, I remember the Cardinals having a really big obese pitcher that threw in the 90’s and there are other chubby pitchers in the Bigs, don’t you think BMI is overrated?  You can be skinny, not in shape, eat the crappiest food but according to BMI you are “healthy”
LBM is correlated with higher velocities – not the only cause of it. Certain pitchers throw harder than others because they are more genetically gifted and/or have better mechanics that get the most out of their bodies.
Just because that is true doesn’t mean being stronger and bigger isn’t also a good idea.
BMI is certainly overrated and a terrible metric of use. Where in my article did I even mention it once?
I agree it’s important to be in shape as an athlete.
I thought research figured out that fastball velocity is directly correlated to hip rotation velocity.  Rotating against the front leg, using the front leg as a blocking tool, is where you get your velocity from.
I mentioned BMI cause it calculates the percent of fat a person may have on their body which can indicate if somebody is lean or not.
Rotation is the single most important factor in fastball velocity, yes. How can we train to make pitchers rotate faster, then?
BMI does not calculate the percentage of fat a person has on their body. It is simple weight divided by height, which is idiotic. Nearly all linebackers in the NFL are “overweight” or “obese” even if their bodyfat percentage is around 14-15%.
Yea I know it doesn’t calculate the REAL percentage of fat but it claims to do that.  It doesn’t factor in the amount of muscle the individual has.
One thing I noticed about Lincecum is how much he rotates towards 2nd base during his hip load and leads with his hips even as he is still rotated towards 2nd base, then as his leg lowers to his footplant all that twisting momentum he gathered from his hip load is transfered to his stride leg.  When he lands he twists/rotates his hips as if they were going to face 1st base but they can’t face 1st base cause his stride leg blocks the energy from going that way and instead trasfers it up his body and then to his arm.
Good observation, Tony. I especially liked the “rotates his hips as if they were going to face 1st base.” That’s very well said, and actually goes against most “conventional” thinking (everything should go to the target, chin to the catcher’s mitt, etc).
Yea and rotating in that way does bring the hips, torso, shoulders, head and arm forward toward the target but also over the Stride leg due to the rotational forces created by the lower half.

Recovery From Training: Part One - Driveline Baseball,2010-11-30T12:48:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/11/recovery-from-training-part-one/,"The topic of recovery is one that is particularly important to people who train for athletics. The most commonly accepted adaptation model that we use in training is Hans Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome framework. Selye wasn’t an exercise scientist – rather a biologist – but he broke down what happened to the body when stressors were introduced:
You can read more about how Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome model factors into training from the excellent book Practical Programming for Strength Training by Mark Rippetoe. I highly recommend this book for everyone who is serious about training for athletics – even runners.
I’ve written in the past about overtraining and why it’s important to avoid:
Overtraining is a danger for all people who seriously train, and not so much for the people who are jogging three times per week or curling six times per week. For baseball players – particularly pitchers – this is an even more vital concept to manage. As discussed above, when you stress the body in such a way that recovery for that modality is impacted, you will temporarily lose ability in that modality. If you run four miles and this is a sufficient stress to drive adaptation, your long slow distance endurance ability will take a temporary hit. This won’t affect your pitching much, as pitching is an anaerobic/ballistic activity (yet another reason why long distance running is a waste of time for pitchers), but what about other types of training?
Let’s say that on a given day when fully rested with low levels of stress (homework, life issues, physical training, etc), you can throw about 80 miles per hour. Your absolute best fastball is about 83 miles per hour, but 80 mph is a safe range that you’ll be in when throwing a max effort bullpen. What happens if you set a new squat 5RM across three sets on Monday and throw a max effort bullpen on Tuesday? You’ll almost assuredly be throwing less than 80 mph, because your strength and power modalities have been temporarily diminished. The fact that your pitching would suffer is a good thing – it means that the stress that caused this temporary dip in ability will also positively affect it going forward once you are fully recovered. (Actually going out and throwing that bullpen the day after squatting is probably not a good idea.)
Pitching while fatigued is a very good way to hurt yourself. Your mechanics may change while fatigued, introducing a different type of stress to each joint center that has adapted to a previous sequencing model of the kinetic chain. Perhaps your arm lags behind your body because your legs and core are fatigued – this could cause a mechanical flaw during the arm cocking phase and increase the chance of an injury.
Fortunately, rank novices can get away with squatting, lifting heavy weights, and doing sprint-based work while throwing bullpens and suffering few (if any) detrimental effects. So, if you’re new to training and aren’t very advanced when it comes to pitching, you won’t notice much change. However, as players move from the novice end of the spectrum in both pitching ability and weight room proficiency toward the advanced end, this becomes a real issue to plan around.
By properly modulating intensity for intermediate and advanced trainees, you can ensure an athlete will be throwing his maximum effort bullpens while 90-95% fresh and that he will be able to give his best effort in his max effort lifting days as well. This can be achieved by breaking up 5RM/3RM/1RM attempts into longer intervals and introducing more assistance/accessory/partial exercises into the program. But – and this is a major caveat – this type of complex programming is NOT necessary for novices and early-stage intermediates. Assuming they are healthy enough to continue on with a properly-designed program, they should focus on getting strong and sticking to their program as best they can.
The novice stage of training is not a bad thing – it is the period of time where you will make the most rapid gains with almost no need to focus on recovery or serious dietary concerns. I put 250 pounds on my back squat, 100 pounds on my bench press, and 300 pounds on my deadlift in my novice period, which lasted about 8 months – all while maintaining my bodyweight! This is the time to drive the biggest and fastest gains – don’t waste time doing stupid isolation/assistance work when you will derive no benefit from it.
In Part Two of this series, we’ll talk about the modalities of recovery and how it can carry over from one exercise to the next. Recovery is not a pitcher of liquid that you pour into various cups labeled with your bodyparts – it is far more complex than that.

Managing Volume and Intensity in Off-Season Workouts - Driveline Baseball,2010-11-17T00:30:57+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/11/managing-volume-and-intensity-in-off-season-workouts/,"A question I get fairly often involves managing the volume and intensity of off-season workouts. At our facility, we’re just getting underway with the off-season training workouts in our semi-private training groups. Our main group consists of a few younger baseball players, one college-bound baseball player, and a former baseball player turned track-and-field athlete. They all have different programming, of course – one of the younger baseball players has had private pitching lessons with me, while the other two have not, the college-bound player has been training with me for years, and the track and field athlete has been training with me for a year but his programming is radically different now for obvious reasons.
Since none of them have the same training history, age, skill level, or goals, the volume and intensity of their workouts will vary greatly. Everyone begs me for a workout program example (as I noted in What’s a good workout, Kyle?), so I’ll share a workout cycle that we finished with our track and field athlete. This program that I will list was his initial modification from baseball training to field athletics training, and we’ve since changed quite a bit of his exercise selection due to his progression in various lifts (his bench is stalling while his Olympic lifts continue to go up at a rapid pace) – so it’s not current, but it is a decent example of what a reasonably strong high school athlete was doing for 6 weeks.
(all notation is Sets x Reps)
Tuesday – Pressing Strength + Power
Wednesday – Lower Body Strength
Friday – Mixed Strength + Power
Sunday – Lower Body Strength + Mixed Dynamic Effort
All Days:
This example program was designed for someone who had an already good back squat and bench press, but little exposure to overhead pressing and Olympic lifting. We’ve since added more assistance exercises for his bench press and added more back squatting variants (dynamic effort speed box squats) in his program while changing many other things as his tolerance for volume has gone up. He went from a predominantly strength-based program to a mixed strength/power program, and people who typically make this change can tolerate more volume due to lesser total eccentric loading overall. (Going from back squatting for max effort three times per week and having two deadlift variants per week to a program with less squatting and more cleaning/snatching will definitely make you feel a lot less beat up!)
As clients progress by adding weight to the bar, adding velocity to their fastballs, and cutting their sprint times, they also increase the ability to tolerate more volume and intensity (both in-season and off-season) in their workout. Knowing when a client can take more work on is important – just as it is important to know when they need a deload or they approach intermediate status in their training stages, increasing the need for more assistance exercise to properly modulate the intensity of their program.
Hope this answers a few questions!

"Link: The Truth About ""Quick Feet"" - Driveline Baseball",2010-11-03T20:20:57+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/11/link-the-truth-about-quick-feet/,"Eric Cressey linked a great Q&A newsletter from Mike Boyle about agility training and quick feet. I don’t want to plagiarize it all, but this part is absolutely worth quoting:
The best solution to slow feet is to get stronger legs. Feet don’t matter. Legs matter. Think about it this way: If you stand at the starting line and take a quick first step but fail to push with the back leg, you don’t go anywhere. The reality is that a quick first step is actually the result of a powerful first push. We should change the buzzwords and start to say “that kid has a great first push.” Lower body strength is the real cure for slow feet and the real key to speed and to agility. The essence of developing quick feet lies in single-leg strength and single-leg stability work… landing skills. If you cannot decelerate, you cannot accelerate – at least not more than once.
It’s all about training for strength and power in the lower body. Sound familiar?

Strength for Baseball Hitters: Why It's Important - Driveline Baseball,2010-10-29T21:45:56+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/10/strength-for-baseball-hitters-why-its-important/,"We spend a lot of time on this site talking about pitchers: How to train them, how to tweak their mechanics, what causes their injuries, the importance of mobility, and so on and so forth. However, we train hitters at Driveline Baseball as well, and most of our pitchers also can stroke at the plate too! Most of our base training revolves around improving rotational power, so it’s no surprise that the same training that improves fastball velocity also increases bat speed!
Still, you have plenty of people out there who think that simply throwing medicine balls and taking lots of batting practice is good enough. Or maybe they suggest doing bodyweight exercises like push-ups and pull-ups. But never full squats – and definitely not scary Olympic lifts like the power clean!
Fortunately for the coaches with a clue out there, someone has done actual research on this topic. Dr. Coop DeRenne is the foremost authority in exercise science as it relates to baseball training for both pitchers and hitters, and in his excellent book, The Scientific Approach to Hitting, he said this about weight training:
The “Big Three” exercises should be used during the Base Cycle (Periodization) for strength development.
Do you know what “Big Three” he was talking about? It wasn’t push-ups, pull-ups, and jumping jacks – no sir, it was the classic barbell exercises of the Squat, Bench Press, and Power Clean! He then goes on to advocate developing rotational power after a base of strength is established. Additionally, Dr. DeRenne goes on to say…
FREEWEIGHTS AND DUMBBELLS ARE THE BEST EQUIPMENT FOR STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT.
Believe it or not, the capital letters are not my addition to his recommendation – he actually felt that strongly about it!
The Scientific Approach to Hitting
Simply put, strength development leading to rotational power development will give you the bat speed that you’ve always wanted – meaning more doubles and home runs.
One of the guys we train here – named Jack – is a somewhat strong individual who’s a former baseball player. He’s getting into track and field events and will be targeting the javelin in Spring 2011. He’s been training with me for about a year now, and though he took some time off in the summer, his 1RM numbers are approximately:
He’s only been training the Olympic lifts seriously for the past month or so – and performing them in Chuck Taylors for the most part!
Anyway, today he finished up his sets of front squats and I finished up my weighted ball throwing, and before we pushed the sled, he wanted to take some batting practice for the fun of it. Jack hasn’t swung a bat since the late spring when he played baseball for a select team after his HS season ended – I just want to make that clear! Always a guy with decent power, Jack stepped into the batting cage and I grooved him some fastballs. He fouled the first one straight back, but I could tell his bat speed was scary fast. The next pitch he sent right over my pitching shoulder past the L-screen screamingly fast! I threw him a bucket of baseballs and he continued tearing the cover off the ball – almost always centering it and getting tons of lift.
After the session, we laughed about how he hadn’t swung a bat since May and that simply getting stronger and more powerful made a huge impact. He credits the Olympic lifts for his huge boost in power.
All it takes to get that kind of bat speed, strength, and power is to simply join one of our affordable Semi-Private Training groups. Drop by our facility for a free no-obligation session to see if we’re your kind of people! Simply shoot us a line and contact us.
A couple of questions about the big 3 lifts.  Eric Cressey does not advocate bench press due to shoulder issues.  How do you get around this?  A floor press?
Also on your squats, do you use a safety bar or cambered bar to prevent stress on the shoulders?
Thanks
Slewbacca
Most of our pitchers do not straight bar bench press – they are doing DB benches, which gives a little better training effect for the scapulothoracic muscles. The real issue is the fixed-pronated position of the barbell bench press and standing press. Eric’s guys do DB bench variants as well.
We don’t use a cambered bar for squats. I wrote a bit about why I think the “peel-back mechanism” of the back squat externally rotated position is actually a net benefit in novice trainees.
Our pitchers tend not to power clean either – they’re often doing weighted jumps or other plyometric motions to get that explosive training effect.
Do you have DeCoop’s other books and if so, how are they? I just bought the Science of Hitting on your recommendation.
I meant Coop DeRenne.
I only have The Science of Hitting, but I have read nearly all of his research papers. They’re great.

Back Squat vs. Front Squat for Baseball Players,2010-10-12T09:46:58+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/10/back-squat-vs-front-squat-for-baseball-pitchers/,"Every good baseball training program is going to have a significant strength training component to it, particularly in the off-season. And that strength training program better include some variation of squats – otherwise it’s completely useless.
There aren’t a lot of absolutes when it comes to training, but if you’re not squatting, you’re wasting your time.
No, lunges are not a suitable replacement – and whatever you call the bastardized knee-bends in Smith machines don’t count either. By the way, those “squats” done in the Smith machine have 30-40% higher shear forces than any type of free weight squats (Andrews JG, Hay JG and Vaughan CL. Knee shear forces during a squat exercise using a barbell and a weight machine).
In short: Don’t do Smith machine nonsense.
Now on to the main argument: Should baseball players (particularly pitchers) do front squats or back squats?
Eric Cressey is famous for having his guys only doing front squats and other “safer” squat variations like the safety bar or giant cambered bar versions. In contrast, all of our pitchers do back squats.
Well, it’s not as simple as picking a winner. Eric is opposed to back squats for baseball pitchers because:
At last check, 74% of the Cressey Performance clientele is baseball players. The majority of these athletes have acquired actual structural changes to their shoulders that make the back squat set-up more of an at-risk position than in non-overhead-throwing athletes. To make a long story short, in this externally rotated, abducted position of the shoulder girdle, the biceps tendon pulls awkwardly on the superior labrum. This peel-back mechanism is exascerbated in the presence of a glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) and scapular instability – two features extremely common in baseball players. So, for these folks, the front squat is a much safer alternative. We also use giant cambered bar and safety squat bar squat and lunge variations.
I agree that this “peel-back mechanism” is contraindicated for baseball players. However, both Eric and I address the asymmetries of baseball pitchers’ GIRD issues and their scapular instability / weakness problems through corrective exercise and training.
Pitchers that come to Driveline get a thorough initial evaluation to determine how screwed up their throwing shoulder is and get a full medical history on their previous injuries and exercise programs. If it’s truly bad, they won’t be back squatting right off the bat, but to completely omit the back squat removes a great training effect.
Squat Variants, as seen in Starting Strength
The front squat does not engage the posterior chain like the back squat does, and you can’t front squat as much as you can back squat due to the shortened hamstring position you are initially in, the upright torso, the lack of back extension in the movement, and the lever arm out front of the body.
However, the front squat is “safer” because there is less torque on the back; it’s less likely you will injure yourself doing a front squat (you tend to just dump the bar in the front squat if you get too forward; in the back squat, you can get into lumbar flexion under load).
This is truly the crux of the argument – risk vs. reward.
Eric trains primarily high-profile baseball athletes – many of them professional – while the majority of the athletes who train at Driveline Baseball are high school and college athletes trying to break out or make elite teams.
This is an important distinction – the way we approach our younger high school and college clients is more aggressive because they can take a few more risks to get where they need to be, rather than managing their health so they can pitch on their professional squads.
However, at the end of the day, I think that using the back squat is important for baseball pitchers of all varieties, assuming that you can get their asymmetries under control. The back squat simply produces a superior training effect and combines it with outstanding training economy that you don’t get with the front squat and additional accessory exercises.
The front squat being so quad-dominant is a concern, considering most athletes come to see me having done so much long-distance running (much on treadmills) and quad-dominant work that just front squatting can exacerbate this asymmetry. So much of pitching and other athletic movements involves the glutes and hamstrings, and the back squat trains them much harder than the front squat (not to mention the higher amounts of weight you can move with the back squat).
Yes! I think the shoulder external rotator stretch you get with the back squat is actually rather beneficial for untrained and novice populations. Younger pitchers often have poor ER and MER in their deliveries, and tweaking their mechanics to produce higher values of MER over a short period of time without addressing static ER can lead to injury. There exists evidence that a larger gap between static ER and dynamically achieved MER in the pitching motion can lead to medial elbow injury. (“The role of shoulder maximum external rotation during throwing for elbow injury prevention in baseball players” by Miyashita et al.)
While I use the low-bar squat (due to training as a powerlifter), the high-bar back squat is likely to be less annoying for baseball pitchers due to the more comfortable position for the shoulders when the bar is higher up on the traps. However, nothing’s free: Due to the more mechanically efficient position of the low-bar variant, you can squat more weight.
Of course, this comes with a more “compromised” forced shoulder external rotation position and the increased risk of losing the bar forward if your squatting mechanics are not up to snuff, but these things are not a problem if managed correctly.
Back squats are preferable to front squats, so long as you carefully manage the population that you train! This means more internal rotation static stretching for the baseball players and soft tissue work for those with pre-existing conditions. It means limiting back squats for pitchers with gross asymmetries. However, in relatively healthy populations, put that bar on your back and get low!

Nutrition: Pre/Post-Workout Guidelines (Alan Aragon) - Driveline Baseball,2010-10-05T04:30:04+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/10/nutrition-prepost-workout-guidelines-alan-aragon/,"Alan Aragon is a nutritional expert that I hold in the highest regard. His advice is extremely effective, yet simple to understand. I get a lot of questions about pre-workout and post-workout nutrition, so I figured I would post Alan’s excellent advice here for everyone to review:
The protocol I recommend currently is strikingly similar to the original, with a few VERY insignificant tweaks. Note that TBW = target bodyweight:
60-90 minutes preworkout, have a solid, balanced meal:
Protein = 0.25g/lb TBW
Carbs = 0.25g/lb TBW
Adding fat at this point is fine, use your discretion as long as it fits into your macro goals. Note that this meal is skipped if you train 1st thing in the morning.
[OR]
30-0 minutes preworkout – (and/or sipped throughout the workout), have a liquid or easily digested meal:
Protein = 0.25g/lb TBW
Carbs = 0.25g/lb TBW
If you were going to train for close to or more than 2 hours continuously, it would definitely benefit you to have this extra preworkout meal either immediately prior to, or sipped during training. Keep the fats here incidental & not added if you’re prone to gastric distress during training.
Within 30 minutes postworkout, have either a liquid or solid meal:
Protein = 0.25g/lb TBW
Carbs = 0.25-0.5g/lb TBW, depending on how carb-restricted your diet is.
Amount of fat here doesn’t matter as long as your daily target is hit.
Post-postworkout is simply your next sheduled meal, whether it’s 1, 2, or 3 hrs later simply doesn’t matter – especially if your immediate postworkout meal was designed as above.
NOTE: The small differences are mainly geared toward simplifying the guidelines. The rest of the recommendations about food types are pretty much the same. Also note that I no longer give a damn about GI, it doesn’t really make a difference one way or another. If you want high GI carbs pre and/or during training, go for it. As time has passed, GI has proven itself to be a worthless, irrelevant index. Insulinogenesis is a separate issue, and slight elevations during & postworkout is a great idea. This accomplished by both food type & food amount, the latter being more important. To boot, the necessary insulin elevations for maximal net gains in protein balance are easily met without specific attempts at spiking it up. There’s obviously a lot more to this, but that’s the important basics. The rest is fringe.
Glycemic Index (GI) has gotten a lot of attention over the past few years – white bread is nutritionally worse than wheat bread, stay away from pasta, etc – and Alan rightfully dismisses it as bunk. It makes a difference in diseased/afflicted populations, but it is all but irrelevant for the average human. People love to focus on “fringe” issues, because it makes them feel intellectually superior – yet they don’t even focus on the basics. As a good friend of mine always says, “Focus on what matters.” And what matters in nutrition for athletes is:

MLB Training vs. The Rest of Us - Driveline Baseball,2010-09-28T05:37:42+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/09/mlb-training-vs-the-rest-of-us/,"Search YouTube for “MLB weight room training” and you’ll find plenty of gems – guys using the Smith machine for squatting, Hammer Strength incline pressing machines, and BOSU Balls being used in ways I can’t even describe. And believe it or not, these guys are often professional baseball players! And so the average person thinks that this is the way to get strong and to make it in the majors – use the machines at the 24 Hour Fitness and you too can throw 90 MPH!
Popular in MLB Weight Rooms – Wait, What?
Hopefully you realize that this is quite ridiculous. Smith machines, BOSU Balls, and fixed-motion machines are all inferior to simple free weight training with barbells, dumbbells, medicine balls, xpxlyometricxx boxes, and other types of implements that use compound movements to develop strength, speed, and power.
So why do professional players use these ridiculous machines? A big reason is “safety.” Guys who can throw 90 MPH, hit 40 jacks per year, or run a 4.6 40 tend to be treated like babies when they get into a professional system – especially if the team paid big bonus money to them. In 2011, Nomar Garciaparra was poking fun at upcoming player, saying that his unorthodox training methods would have to go by the wayside when he became a professional baseball player. This type of thinking is pervasive in professional baseball, and it’s quite honestly a shame. Some athletes train their butts off to be able to throw as hard as they do, and to be forced to back off in the name of “safety” is absurd.
Want more evidence? Check out this video demonstrating “back squats” as done by players in the Houston Astros system:
Listen to the coach – he says that because some players don’t speak English, they use the Smith machine. It’s “safer.” Well, a few things:
We had a college player in the facility over the weekend who has aspirations of playing pro ball. He’s got fringe velocity and scouts have told him that he needs to pick up 4-7 MPH to get a look. Now, how we approach him will be vastly different than a pro guy who is already at 92-93 MPH, of course. The pro guy needs to stay healthy and build strength in a more conservative manner, while the college player needs an aggressive program that builds power, velocity, and overall athleticism. However, both programs can be written and maintained without the use of machines to replace solid compound movements like back squats, deadlifts, rows, and presses.
If you have elite MLB velocity by virtue of picking the right parents and winning the genetic lottery, then congratulations! If you’re like the rest of us and need to train very hard to make it to the next level, take a look at the Pitching Program options we offer. Winter training starts next week with only five months to go before the HS season begins.
The bg music sold me IMO
Between his often nonsensical commentary on MLB network and the anecdote on training advice above, I wonder if Nomar has anything to offer the baseball community now that his playing days are long gone.

Programming Mistake: Doing Too Much - Driveline Baseball,2010-09-18T02:30:50+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/09/programming-mistake-doing-too-much/,"When otherwise intelligent people get into the gym for the first time (or their second/third/fourth time after a layoff), they invariably come up with some elaborate program that isolates body parts and looks ridiculously scientific to them. To people who have even a basic understanding of exercise science, it’s a load of garbage.
Take for example this workout routine:
Day 1 – Chest/Abs:
Cable Flies 3×12-15 reps (alternate between working upper and base)
Incline Smith Bench 4×12-15 reps
Flat Bench 4×12-15 reps
Decline Bench 4 12-15 reps
Incline DB flies (30 degrees) 3×10-12 reps
Exercise Ball Crunches 3×15-20 reps
Leg Lifts 3×12-15 reps
Cable Crunches 3×15-20 reps
Day 2 – Back:
Deadlifts 5×8-10 reps
Lat Pull Downs 5×10-12 reps
Seated Rows 4×8-10 reps
DB Single Arm Rows 3×12-15 reps
Barbell Rows 3×10 reps
Str8 Arm Lat Pulldowns 4×12-15 reps
Day 3 – Shoulders/Calves:
Rear Delt Flies 4×10-12 reps
Arnold Press 3×8-10 reps
Lat Raises 4×10-12 reps
Front Raises 4×10-12 reps
Wide Grip BB High Pulls 3×10-12 reps
Behind The Head Smith Machine Military Press 3×10-12 reps
Seated Calf Raises/Donkey Calf Raise Superset 5×12-15 reps
Farmer Walk Forward and Backward
Day 4 – Arms/Traps/Abs:
Alt DB Curls/Single Arm Tricep Extension superset 4×10-12 reps
BB Curl/DB Tricep Kickbacks superset 3×12-15 reps
Isolated DB Curl/Dips superset 3x 10-12 reps
Armblaster Cable Curls/V Bar Pulldowns or Rope superset 4×10-12 reps
Close grip BB Shrugs (front and back) 4×10-12 reps
DB Shrugs 3×10-12 reps
Close Grip BB High Pulls 3×10-12 reps
*repeat Ab routine
Day5 – Quads/Hams/Calves:
DB Deadlifts/Stiff legged deadlifts superset 4×10-12 reps
Lunges/Lying Leg Curls superset 3×12-15 reps
Standing Leg Curl 4×10-12 reps
Leg Extension 4×10-12 reps
*repeat Calve routine
This lifter is a beginner based on his previous lifts and training status. What do you immediately notice? Well, that he’s “isolating” muscle groups and doing a ridiculous amount of repetitions per day over five days in the gym. Beginners do not need this much volume. It is far too much fancy nonsense and not enough actual compound movements to get strong and/or look better.
If you can wade through that giant mess of a “program,” you’ll see that there aren’t any squats. Any training program without squats is useless – period.
The program above is fairly common for people who like to think for themselves and pride themselves on being smart and free-thinking. The problem, of course, is that nearly all these people suffer from the Dunning-Kruger Effect, which essentially states that unskilled/uneducated people suffer from an illusion that they are smarter than everyone else and can do things their way, when in reality they are completely incompetent. As Charles Darwin said: “Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.”

Myth: Strength Training is Not Specific to Baseball Pitching - Driveline Baseball,2010-09-15T23:00:13+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/09/myth-strength-training-is-not-specific-to-baseball-pitching/,"This myth has been perpetuated throughout baseball, from the lowest to the highest levels and all around the world. Frankly, it’s a load of BS. It’s very simple to understand without getting too deep into the physics of the movement, so we’ll keep it short.
You can find no shortage of papers that cite that elbow valgus stress in the pitching motion can exceed 60 Newton-meters (Medscape), which is higher than the theoretical maximum loading ability of the UCL in cadaver-based studies. But what exactly does 60 Newton-meters mean? Well, 60 Newton-meters is roughly equivalent to 81.35 pound-feet of torque. One foot-pound force is equivalent to one pound of force acting at a perpendicular distance of one foot from a pivot point. So, if you moved a one pound object exactly one foot in the air perpendicular to the force, that qualifies. A simple example is the bench press:
Bench Press
It’s not perfect, since no lifter moves the bar exactly perpendicular to the body, but it’s close.
Critics often say that the bench press doesn’t contribute to release velocity or injury prevention because a baseball weighs 5 ounces while a bench press is far greater. The truth, of course, is that the actual weight does not matter. Your body doesn’t care if an object weighs 5 ounces or 200 pounds – it cares what the raw force acting upon the body is!
Since we know that releasing a baseball can create up to (or even exceed) 81.35 pound-feet of torque, let’s do some simple math to see how much force a 135 lb. bench press creates. Keeping it very simple, let’s assume that the bench press moves 12 inches in the concentric direction roughly perpendicular to the action of force. This would mean that a single rep of the bench produces 135 pound-feet of torque per concentric repetition!
Consider that the higher values in the bench press do not exactly mimic the force the elbow undergoes, since more muscle groups are involved in the bench press. Think about which large muscle groups in the shoulder/arm are firing to create release velocity – not many! Therefore, the muscles in the shoulder/elbow undergo a proportionally higher load than the larger muscle groups in the bench press – or squat, deadlift, barbell row, or any other weight room exercise.
The myth that strength training is useless because the baseball only weighs 5 ounces is nothing short of stupid. The load per contracting muscle fiber that the elbow/shoulder experience far exceeds the amount of force that average lifters will experience in their compound movements.
Strength training plays a large part in keeping a baseball pitcher healthy and helping to improve his release velocity. By strengthening the segments that sequence together to throw a ball hard (largest to smallest, proximal to distal), pitchers can increase their fastball velocity. And by strengthening the decelerators, pitchers can safely do so as well.
Train for strength. Don’t listen to the people left behind in the 1960’s. Train at Driveline Baseball.

"The Difference Between ""Working Out"" and Training - Driveline Baseball",2010-09-14T08:28:46+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/09/the-difference-between-working-out-and-training/,"Athletes at Driveline Baseball don’t “work out.” Working out is something the casual gym goer does when he struts into the gym three times a week and benches the same amount of weight for three sets of five to ten reps, does some leg extensions, lat pulldowns, and bicep curls. Working out is a social activity meant to burn up your time and make you feel good about yourself with some indiscernible health benefits that doctors are always talking about on television interviews.
No, we train. Training is setting a short-term, medium-term, and long-term goal plan for yourself arranged around your current desires and abilities. It combines nutrition and physical exertion into a cohesive plan with incremental progress markers on the way to the aforementioned goals.
Training means failing – there’s no way around it. To train effectively means that you will be pushing your body (and mind) to the limit so you can consistently get past the previous level of skill/strength/speed/athleticism you had. And sometimes, this means failing a rep or needing to deload entirely for a week. Maybe it means getting shelled in your scheduled start or striking out six times in a week’s worth of tournament baseball games.
To train, you must be willing to accept that you will be failing. Often. But in competitive athletics, is it any other way? You never learn anything by playing against terribly inferior competition and dominating them. You must constantly challenge yourself to get better, and so it is with training.
Don’t “work out.” Train.

Supplements for Baseball: Part Two - Driveline Baseball,2010-08-27T09:01:25+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/08/supplements-for-baseball-part-two/,"I talked a little bit about supplements for baseball in a previous thread on this blog. In that post, I said:
Supplements that I recommend are almost always going to fit the following categories:
The products I recommended were:
All of those supplements are still plenty fine and worthy of addition to your diet! Here’s just a few more that can help you along the way:
Check out this great article by Chris Shugart on Vitamin D over at T-Nation – titled “D is for Doping.” In it, Shugart says that Vitamin D has positive effects on longevity, performance, and looking good naked. Sounds like an easy sell to me!
Here’s the excerpt on performance:
Studies on Vitamin D, sunlight, and performance go back for decades. Russian studies in the 1930’s showed that 100M dash times improved in irradiated athletes vs. non-irradiated athletes undergoing the same training (7.4% improvement vs. 1.4%).
German studies in the 1940’s showed that irradiation lead to a 13% improvement in performance on the bike ergometer vs. no improvement in the control group.
In the 1950’s researchers saw a “convincing effect” on athletic performance after treating athletes at the Sports College of Cologne. Findings were so convincing that they notified the Olympic Committee.
At one point, even school children were irradiated and given large doses of Vitamin D in 1952 Germany. Treated children showed dramatic increases in overall fitness and cardiovascular performance. UV radiation was also shown to improve reaction times by 17% in a 1956 study.
In the 1960s, a group of American college women were treated with a single dose of ultraviolet irradiation. The results: improvements in strength, speed, and endurance.
Other studies showed “distinct seasonal variation” in the trainability of musculature. Basically, athletes performed better and got stronger in the late summer due to their greater exposure to the sun and subsequent Vitamin D production.
Vitamin D has also been shown to act directly on muscle to increase protein synthesis. Deficient subjects administered Vitamin D showed improvement in muscle protein anabolism and an increase in muscle mass.
Improvements in neuromuscular functioning have also been seen. People with higher levels of Vitamin D generally have better reaction time and balance.
Even more good news: Vitamin D is extremely cheap. You can find it for about 4 cents per softgel from Amazon.com. We recommend Carlson’s Vitamin D softgels – 360 gels of 2000 IU will only run you about $15 and will ship free if you order just $25 worth of products.
Vitamin D Softgels
Whey Protein – Revisited!
I know, I already talked about whey protein in my previous post. I’m including it now because I found a brand and style of whey protein that tastes really good without sacrificing nutritional quality or breaking the bank.
Syntha-6 Whey Protein
Syntha-6 Chocolate Peanut Butter protein mix is great. I mix it with milk in a shaker bottle 3-4 times/day for my protein supplementation, and it works out really well. The instructions say that water works too, but I haven’t had much luck – it tastes terrible to me.
EXTRA INFO: Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin. That means it is found in animal fat and to a lesser extent in plant fat. Good food sources of Vitamin D include: fatty fish (catfish, salmon, tuna, among others), whole eggs (cholesterol in the yolk), and mushrooms.
Vitamin D, however, is synthesized by the body. This means that with ample sunlight (irradiation of the skin by ultraviolet light), Vitamin D is not a necessary supplement. Of course, with sunlight being something that can easily be overdone, it’s hard to say how much is necessary or too much.
Since sunblock helps stop UV rays from penetrating the skin, it follows that sunblock will hamper Vitamin D synthesis.
According to the NIH, the tolerable upper level intake for Vitamin D is still only 2,000 IU – the exact dosage of the recommended pills. If you take those, it might be best to stay out of the sun. As of 1997, some studies had shown that the tolerable upper level intake might be as high as 10,000 IU, but NIH has not changed its recommendation.
Also of note, the NIH recommends at least 200 IU per day (this number assumes no sunlight-based synthesis). Obviously, a higher dose would be recommended for enhanced performance.
A fair amount of research shows that dosing around 5000 IU is worthwhile:
https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/researchRequirements.shtml
(not the most unbiased website, but it’s just a list of research papers)
Dr. Richard Cohen of Bioletics recommends 50 ng/ml concentration, which in average adults is a dose of 4000 IU/day without considering sunlight exposure.
I personally dose 6000-8000 IU/day with no ill effects.
Kyle, just to be clear, you are talking about ADDITIONAL vitamin D, not something that’s already a part of your multi-vitamin, right?
my multi contains 400 IU per serving, but for additional protein synthesis i would need to take in the 2000-4000 IU dose, correct?
Additional, yes.
As always, your mileage may vary, and yadada legal disclaimer here about exceeding the NIH’s recommendations.

Programming Mistake Numero Uno - Driveline Baseball,2010-07-13T09:28:20+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/07/programming-mistake-numero-uno/,"We’re right in the middle of the busiest time for our athletes – Summer baseball season is here and Fall Ball is just around the corner! With it comes diminished time for Strength and Conditioning training, as I pointed out in In-Season Training: A Difficult Task. However, too many athletes get wrapped up in not being able to follow what they think they should be doing for strength training and end up doing nothing. Don’t overthink it!
Yes, you’re going to lose some strength during the season if you play competitive baseball (unless you’re a rank novice). Don’t sweat it! If you can get two training sessions in per week with heavy barbell implements, you’ll be doing alright. Just remember to get a heavy squat session and a heavy deadlift session in. Don’t worry so much about pressing, as it can interfere with baseball – especially if you’re a pitcher!
Focus on what you can do, not what you can’t. If you’re too worn-down to squat heavy weights, go lighter and turn it into a metabolic conditioning workout. Do interval training centered around bodyweight movements. Focus on those flexibility and mobility drills that you’ve been ignoring (I know you have, don’t even act like you do ankle mobility drills and sleeper stretches every day). Pull some resistance bands.
Above all – do something!

Progress: How to Measure It - Driveline Baseball,2010-06-10T14:38:14+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/06/progress-how-to-measure-it/,"By the very nature of the population that seeks out coaching, many of my clients are biologically older than their peers. That is to say, while their chronological age is the same as their teammates and competitors, they are much more mature – they’re bigger, throw harder, and swing bats faster. As such, they tend to do very well at their current level of competition. Occasionally, I’ve seen players get arrogant about a particularly good stretch of games – perhaps batting over .400 with a few home runs, or striking out two batters per inning over 20 games.
Now, should a player be excited when their hard work pays off? Of course. But true competitors aren’t satisfied with merely doing well at the level that they’re at. The classic example is Pete Sampras entering and losing matches badly in the U-18 divisions when he was just 12 years old. He could have entered age-appropriate tournaments, or perhaps only stepped up to the U-14 bracket, but he wouldn’t have met the challenges that he would have invariably faced as a professional.
A more sport-specific anecdote comes from Paul DePodesta’s blog: It Might Be Dangerous… You Go First. Paul is a current assistant in the front office of the San Diego Padres and is the former General Manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He posted a blog article about Wade LeBlanc in 2009, where he said this:
Leblanc pitched about 150 innings between HA and AA and now has almost 200 in AAA. That isn’t terribly unusual for an advanced college starter, and he’s still in the development process now.
The other thing, and possibly more importantly, is that sometimes guys need to be pushed in order to progress. For instance, had we left Leblanc at AA he could have continued to get everyone out with his changeup without needing to locate his fastball effectively. He needed to get to a level with more advanced hitters that would force him to make an adjustment to his game.
I tell all my pitchers about this story. Wade LeBlanc has one of the most devastating changeups in baseball and has a 3.29 ERA this year to go with it. If you’re a sabermetrics geek (like I am), you’ll note that LeBlanc’s changeup rates at +4.1 runs above average, while his fastball is -7.5 runs below average and his curveball is -3.6 runs below average. So LeBlanc has a below-average fastball and curveball but a solidly above-average changeup. DePodesta’s point is that LeBlanc could have simply used his major league above-average changeup (very advanced for the minors) to get hitters out and produce solid numbers, but that it wouldn’t have told the front office anything.
This is one area where people who rely too much on basic stats (strikeouts, walks, earned runs, home runs, RBIs, etc) make their biggest mistakes. Just because a pitcher is putting up a lot of great numbers at lower levels does not mean they are ready to move on. In LeBlanc’s case, his solid minor league numbers prior to jumping to AAA were a mirage – his success there was not indicative of his major league talent level. Big league hitters know how to lay off changeups and look for below-average fastballs to pound into the stands. Minor league hitters do not. And that’s what separates the two levels of competition.
Wade LeBlanc's Changeup
You should always have your eye on the next level. When you pitch in a game, you want to dominate the hitters that you face, certainly, but if you’re relying on your breaking ball too much to do so, that isn’t helping you develop as a player down the line. When scouts come to see you as a high school sophomore, they don’t want to see a below-average curveball fooling bad high school hitters. Scouts want to see fastball velocity, but they also really want to see that you have an idea of what you’re doing with it. They want to know if you can cut it, run it, sink it, and most of all: locate it. I tell all my pitchers that when they can throw a complete game shutout throwing only fastballs that they’ll be ready to move on to the next level. Until then, they’ll never know if their stuff will play up at the next level.
In short: Progress is not measured by what you’ve done right now. It’s measured by what you will do down the line against tougher competition. Don’t ever get them confused.

Link/Video: Mariners Strength Program - Driveline Baseball,2010-03-19T07:41:14+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/03/linkvideo-mariners-strength-program/,"The Seattle Mariners have switched from a generic strength and conditioning program to a “high-tech” advanced program by Dr. Marcus Elliot. Many articles on the switch have talked about the lack of weights in the weight room and the emphasis on xpxlyometricxx/movement training, leading many to believe that weights were completely left out of the program altogether. As the video below shows, this isn’t exactly the case:
[youtube Bsd_9zW3MyE nolink]
As you can see, they have a significant amount of cable pulleys with variable resistance to train hip rotation, a rack of dumbbells, and three power cages with a variety of barbells. While this doesn’t constitute a “lack of weights” by anyone in the know, I’m willing to bet most reporters were used to seeing a bunch of isolation-based machines and equated them as “weight training.”
As Dr. Marcus Elliot so succinctly points out, training hip rotation is extremely important in baseball athletes. He also goes on to say that athletes must train their legs for strength and also mentions the need for improved thoracic extension. Improving tissue quality via self-myofascial release (SMR, also known as foam rolling) and performing postural exercises that address these needs is extremely important in a baseball training program.
I’m glad to see a major-league organization that “gets it” and doesn’t have their guys training on machines like most other organizations do. The attention to thoracic extension, hip rotation, and leg strength (just to name a few things I like about the program) are all very good and necessary if you want to effectively train baseball athletes.
He mentioned the Mariners having “exclusive rights” to the training program for the next 3 years. How can the rights to a certain type of training be owned?
The 3P contract is exclusive. If someone else can duplicate what 3P does, then the training won’t be exclusive. Until then, though…
Hi Kyle,
Great to see the evolution, however, instructors like Ron Wolforth, Brent Strom, Paul Reddick, Jeff Cavaliere, Perry Husband and Dr. Mike Marshall and Tom House have been utilizing this training for several years with amazing results only to be shunned and hammered by the baseball industry.
I, too, am glad an organization “gets it.”
Bill,
Absolutely – I know that plenty of outstanding trainers have been doing great work outside of MLB organizations, but there’s not a lot of this inside the organizations. As you said, they get shut out of the industry because it’s too “atypical” or too dangerous – can’t have fragile pitchers doing scary-looking things like box jumps and deadlifts!
[…] and throwing program, we know he’s been doing more of it. And we also know that the Seattle Mariners use Dr. Marcus Elliot’s programs for many of their athletes, which revolves around free weights, medicine balls, and integrating biomechanical analysis […]

In-Season Training: A Difficult Task - Driveline Baseball,2010-03-14T08:57:52+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/03/in-season-training-a-difficult-task/,"Strength and conditioning is tough enough in the offseason, but once you have to focus on practices, bullpens, batting cage time, skill development, and playing games, training for strength and speed becomes nearly impossible! I’m a huge supporter of youth athletes picking up multiple sports in their early years of high school – by all means, join the soccer team, lacrosse team, football team, and baseball team (of course). However, this diversity comes at a price: You can get good at all the sports and increase your overall fitness as a result, but you’ll rarely be great at any of them. Why? There’s no offseason to take your focus off performance and place it on training to increase general strength and conditioning.
As you progress through high school, it’s worth analyzing what sports you really like and the ones you have some talent in. If you’ve got a shot to play college or pro baseball, you should seriously consider dropping the other sports so you can have a clearly defined workout program in the off-season to focus on your SPARQ Baseball metrics, overall bat speed, fastball velocity, fat loss, or just getting stronger and fitter.
When you have a clearly defined off-season and in-season timeline, I recommend focusing the bulk of your off-season work with high volume and high intensity weight training that’s hard to recover from. This type of training is inappropriate for in-season training but yields great benefits if you can set aside enough time to recover from the effects of the exercises. As you approach the competitive season, you should deload and switch your focus to skill work like taking grounders/fly balls, throwing long toss and bullpens, changing your pitching mechanics so you can throw harder and with less effort, examining your swing for flaws, and putting that increased strength and fitness to good use!
During the season, strength training will become very hard. If you’re in high school, you have 20 games with the school, plus playoffs, plus five practices a week, plus weekend practices or workouts with your select/travel team. Yikes! It becomes impossible to squat or deadlift heavy and recover from the effects of the training in enough time for the next game. Finding one day per week that you can lift heavy to maintain strength is your best bet, if possible.  Focusing on high intensity but low volume workouts (heavy triples in the squat and deadlift, for example) will help you maintain the strength levels you built up in the off-season without seriously impacting your recovery system in a negative manner.
Improving your sprint times and medball throws are goals you can focus on during the season, as these activities dovetail nicely with conditioning that’s done in-season with your team already and won’t tax you too much. Kettlebell swings are a great way to develop rapid hip extension power, provides a nice conditioning stimulus, and are easy to find time for!
[…] corner! With it comes diminished time for Strength and Conditioning training, as I pointed out in In-Season Training: A Difficult Task. However, too many athletes get wrapped up in not being able to follow what they think they should […]

P90x for Baseball? - Driveline Baseball,2010-03-03T16:42:56+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/03/p90x-for-baseball/,"In an excellent (and controversial) post about Crossfit for baseball athletes, Eric Cressey talked about why Crossfit’s Workout of the Day is a poor way to train for baseball for many reasons. One such reason was:
3) I have huge concerns about poor exercise technique in conditions of fatigue in anyone, but these situations concern me even more in a population like baseball players that has a remarkably high injury rate as-is.  The fact that 57% of pitchers suffer some sort of shoulder injury during each season says something.  Just think of what that rate is when you factor in problems in other areas, too!  The primary goal should not be entertainment or variety (or “muscle confusion,” for all the morons in pro baseball who call P90X their “hardcore” off-season program).  Rather, the goals should be a) keeping guys on the field and b) safe performance enhancement strategies (in that order).
Not only is this an excellent point, but the bolded section (emphasis mine) deserves an in-depth look as well.
P90x is a popular training system sold on infomercials and targets the young adult population from ages 18-30, who unsurprisingly have a lot of dispensable income and are predisposed to watching a lot of television. P90x’s secret?
The secret behind the P90X system is an advanced training technique called Muscle Confusion™, which accelerates the results process by constantly introducing new moves and routines so your body never plateaus, and you never get bored!
Let’s just get this out of the way: This statement is stupid.
Problem One: Constantly introducing new moves and routines on a daily basis ensures that you are unable to accurately track your progress throughout the program.
For those unaware of what P90x looks like, here’s a sample infomercial with their exercises:
[youtube RXZhfMFMqi4 nolink]
You’ll notice a lot of light DB and bodyweight exercises done in rapid succession with a clock timing you.
Problem Two: P90x incorporates little – if any – heavy resistance training to build strength. Contrary to popular belief, strength is not some nebulous word that you throw around and occasionally combine with the word “core.” Strength is binary – it is the answer to the question “Did I move this heavy object that weighs X pounds?” You cannot build strength effectively without the ability to appropriately load an exercise that works your body’s musculature with compound movements. This typically ends up involving barbells and exercises like the squat, deadlift, bench press, press, and rows.
I happen to have a copy of the training schedule (given to me by a friend who failed to complete the program), and while I won’t reproduce it in its entirety, suffice to say that you are “training” six days a week with a single rest day that involves some light yoga and/or stretching.
Problem Three: Any exercise program that has you training hard for six days in a row will eventually lead to overtraining, a phenomenon I discussed in an earlier blog post.
Let’s get to baseball-specific problems with P90x, shall we?
P90x works your body in segments – isolating body parts over given days. Day 1 might be a “Chest and Back” workout while Day 5 is a “Shoulders and Arms” workout. The problem with this approach is that baseball (and every other sport out there, really) is not an isolation-based sport. Training your body to work via isolated movements will have little – if any – carryover to athletic competition. Strength, conditioning, and overall fitness is best built through compound movements that are capable of moving heavy weight through multi-joint activities – just like you would in any sport!
Problem Four: Isolation-based training – which P90x is – has little carryover to athletic competition.
While P90x can lead to building instabilities and promote dysfunction through isolated movements, I’m not terribly worried about the injury factor that it can absolutely lead to in baseball players (particularly pitchers). Why? Because P90x uses movements that necessitate low resistances, and so not much is getting done.
I can already see your responses: “But Kyle,” you say, “my completely sedentary and untrained friend did P90x Lean and got in much better shape over 90 days! Take that!”
There’s an easy response to this – and one that I hope everyone who reads my blog understands and memorizes. They are the three tenets of exercise science, and they are:
P90x for completely untrained individuals fall directly under the first bullet point. Training 3-4 times a week while focusing on squats, deadlifts, chin-ups, rows, explosive movements, and a focus on mobility fall directly under the second bullet point. And Olympic athletes who are trying to increase their Clean and Jerk from 212 kg to 214 kg in the matter of four years fall under the third bullet point.
If you take a completely sedentary individual and have them run 2 miles a day, every other day, their one-rep max (1RM) squat will go up. Does this mean running is the best way to increase your squat? No. It means that for individuals who don’t train and who have bodies completely unadapted to stress that anything will work.
While I’m not a fan of cookie-cutter workouts for baseball athletes, if you absolutely must get a program from someone – and you’re an untrained novice – do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore. It’s a must-own for anyone who takes strength training seriously anyway, so you might as well pick it up and follow the program. If you’re a baseball pitcher, I’d advise against overhead pressing and possibly switching the low-bar back squat for front squats or the high-bar back squat, but those are modifications you can make after you read the book and start to understand the basics of exercise science.
Friends don’t let friends do P90x. Just say no, kids.

I like this post, Kyle.
You’re right about the low-bar back squat, though there are ways to accommodate it that don’t strain the rotator cuff. A Top Squat attachment is one, a yoke bar is another, or you can always grab a pair of lifting straps and loop them over facing forward, all of which will allow you to hold the bar in a neutral hand position out in front of your body. I don’t see a lot of people being taught the low-bar back squat these days, though.
Dan,
Thanks for the comment. Indeed, you can use many implements to accommodate the low-bar position that’s less stressful on the rotator cuff and shoulder in general.
Starting Strength uses the low-bar position for more posterior chain and hamstring involvement, and I use it in my own training, but athletic carryover is a bit higher with the high-bar position and it comes more naturally to clients, I’ve found.
Kyle,
I am 31 years old and have some fat to lose. I am guilty of being gullable I did buy the P90X package. I like it, its tough, I feel like I get a workout, but I don’t feel the same as I do when I lift weights and run outside. So what would suggest for someone who wants to get a little stronger, more flexable, but also needs to lose some weight?
Eddie,
Sorry for the late reply!
Pick up a copy of Mark Rippetoe’s “Starting Strength” and check out basic barbell training. Losing weight is all about diet and very little about exercise. For good cardio to improve endurance (VO2max) and fat loss, search the Internet for “Tabata protocol” articles.
For flexibility, I’d look up Eric Cressey’s products like Magnificent Mobility and/or Assess and Correct.
Interesting article Kyle. In my opinion and from personal experience I think P90x is amazing for baseball players, especially pitchers. Muscle confusion is NOT BS. Its science… Kung Fu masters have been using the science of muscle confusion for thousands of years! BTW, Eric Cressey gets PAID to train people… P90x takes money out of his pocket so of course he is going to give it a bad review!
I’m a 30 year old pitcher playing in amateur leagues year round. I just started p90x a few weeks ago. I’m not even doing it everyday, just a couple times per week and I can already feel a major difference. I threw a complete game shut out which I havent been able to do since high school. I usually tire after the 5th or 6th inning. My fastball had more “pop” to it as well.
Jeff, you’re forgetting the three rules I laid out above:
1. Everything works.
2. Some things work better than others.
3. Nothing works forever.
I have completed P90x and Insanity, both infomercial fitness sets sold on TV.  I would say you are dead wrong.  I love your blog, but with P90x, you improve your cardio, core, leg strength and overall level of fitness more than any other workout I’ve ever done.  I played HS basketball and volleyball with some pretty intense coaches, and I was never in this kind of shape.  I think you need to try the workouts before you rip them apart.  Sure, it might not be tuned to baseball, but it works muscles and muscle groups you never even knew you had.
The first routine is all pullups and pushups.  If you do it twice, you’ll already see and feel a noticable difference.  There is also plyometrics, yoga, stretching and core.
You might say “everything works,” but I would argue that P90x works better than anything else out there.
Interesting.  I won’t argue that P90X is not meant for baseball training.  But the arguments you give show you don’t know the course.  On problem one, tracking the progress in the program is a key part of P90X and it is emphasized in virtually strength routine.  And Horton is constantly telling you to stop the tape when you need to rest, etc.
On problem 2, Horton also is constantly telling people that if you want size/strength, go to a weight where you go to 6 to 8 reps. If you’re looking for squats, deadlifts, bench presses, presses, and rows, these exercises do appear in various forms in the course (pushups for bench presses is the exception).
On problems 3 and 4, your problem with isolation training appears to be addressed through the core synergistics module, abdominals module  and yoga module.
As I said, I wouldn’t advocate P90X for a total baseball training workout, though I think it is much better than what most people are doing (all that “muscle confusion” really means is “variety” and “variety” means the athlete won’t get as bored of the training as soon — a great motivator!).  But the points you make against P90X are not convincing and seem to be based on a very shallow understanding of the program.
Why dont you try p90x?    how on earth can you say that there is no weight training involved? about 60 percent of it is.
“On problem 2, Horton also is constantly telling people that if you want size/strength, go to a weight where you go to 6 to 8 reps.”
I can squat 315 lbs 6-8 times. Can I do this in P90x?
“Why dont you try p90x? how on earth can you say that there is no weight training involved? about 60 percent of it is.”
Weight training is not doing push-ups and pull-ups with 20 lb. DBs or resistance bands.
I don’t see any deadlifts in P90x. Or power cleans.
your an idiot
I tried XP90 but TIME was an issue.
Everyday became boring.
Doing full body weights 2 days, sprints 3, and stretching 1 works as good.
Only at gym 2 days, the rest can train in my cellar.
P90X still is phenomenal structured program created by Tony Horton
It all depends on what your goals are. If your goals are baseball specific, P90X is not the best program to be using. Our Hacking the Kinetic Chain: Advanced Pitching book comes with strength training programming as well as throwing programming. This would be a great resource if your interested in executing our program on your own!

Should Pitchers Bench Press?,2010-02-12T02:28:59+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/02/link-should-pitchers-bench-press/,"Another excellent article by Eric Cressey is available here: Should Pitchers Bench Press?
The NFL Combine Bench Press – Oh wait, this is a baseball site…
Most of my clients are interested in throwing hard, hitting a ball farther, and developing as a baseball player. However, most of my clients are also high school or college players who have egos and dreams of being able to bench a 225 lb. bar 24 times like Brady Quinn did in 2008. A bad comparison? Not really – consider that Brady Quinn is a quarterback who hasn’t exactly had a lot of success in Cleveland (and yes, his surrounding team isn’t helping much), and at the end of the day, he is throwing a ball for a living. Sound like a position in baseball to you?
At any rate, I understand the desire to have a big straight-bar bench press. It’s the lift that gets the most attention in the gym by men and women alike, and it’s typically the first question anyone asks you when you say that you work out four times a week. (Incidentally, I ask how much they squat – or if I’m being funny, deadlift – and always get a stammering answer.) It builds big pecs and arms and all those other beach muscles that we’re big fans of. However, all of this musculature has very little (if any) carryover to throwing (or hitting!) a baseball hard. Sorry, guys. Here’s what Eric said in his article:
With dumbbell benching, we recognize that we get better range-of-motion, freer movement of the humerus (instead of being locked into internal rotation), and increased core activation – particularly if we’re doing alternating DB presses or 1-arm db presses.  There is even a bit more scapular movement in these variations (even if we don’t actually coach it).
With a barbell bench press, you don’t really get any of these benefits – and it’s somewhat inferior from a range-of-motion standpoint.  While it may allow you to jack up the weight and potentially put on muscle mass a bit more easily, the truth is that muscle mass here – particularly if it leads to restrictions in shoulder and scapular movement – won’t carry over to throwing the way the muscle mass in the lower half and upper back will.  I’ve seen a ton of guys with loads of external rotation and horizontal abduction range-of-motion throw the crap out of the baseball, but can’t say that I’ve ever seen any correlation – in the research or my anecdotal experience – between a good bench press and throwing velocity.
This is exactly why my pitchers use the dumbbell neutral-grip bench press movement as their primary upper body pressing movement in addition to push-ups that are balanced out by chin-ups and pull-ups (vertical pulling is very helpful for pitchers).
So, to all you pitchers out there: While the squat (front or back) and the deadlift aren’t as sexy as the bench press, they’re simply more useful for sport-specific and general strength purposes. Unfortunately, my guys still love to straight-bar bench press, so we do it once a week. In return, they promise to do a dumbbell neutral-grip bench press day on their other upper body day as well, and bang out a lot of chin-ups and pull-ups along the way. Some of them bench more than I do (which isn’t saying much). But I’ve still got them all in the squat and deadlift. For now.
If you are interested in benching check out our article on common benching mistakes and how to fix them.
Keep up the good work Kyle!

Proper Warmups For Weight Training - Driveline Baseball,2010-02-09T08:05:30+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/02/proper-warmups-for-weight-training/,"Our baseball athletes undergo a rigorous offseason workout schedule that incorporates a ton of heavy weight lifting – mostly done with barbells, but we use dumbbells for single-arm exercises (rows) and pressing (bench press with the neutral grip and the occasional push press) as well. Most of the athletes that I get come into the gym ready to go wearing shorts and a cotton t-shirt and ask “What’s first, coach?” Assuming that they’ve already passed their initial assessment that all my clients undergo, we talk to them about proper warmup procedures and ask them what they typically do to get ready for lifting some serious weight.
The responses are varied and interesting. Most include basic static stretching, maybe a little bit of running or elliptical trainer work, a few minutes on the Airdyne, and in some exceptional cases, yoga poses and actual dynamic range of motion work. However, no one has come to me and discussed soft tissue quality and/or foam rolling as part of their warmup techniques!
Soft tissue quality is extremely important when maintaining and gaining flexibility/mobility and plays a huge role in “prehab” and rehab operations equally. This topic is worth studying and dedicating a few posts to later on, but for now I’ll just talk about proper warmups that we use at Driveline Baseball to get ready to move heavy weight (which are similar to the warmups we do before batting practice or throwing a bullpen).
To me, foam rolling is a no-brainer. Eric Cressey and Mike Robertson wrote a groundbreaking article titled “Feel Better for 10 Bucks” on T-Nation that changed the way I trained athletes (and myself). Here’s a quick excerpt from said article:
I’m going to plagiarize Eric Cressey again and show you a video that he taped that discusses the foam rolling progressions he has his athletes go through. They are very similar and nearly identical to the foam rolling patterns our athletes go through:
For many athletes – and especially baseball players –  this involves pounding away at hip mobility. Stronglifts.com has a great article on this topic along with companion videos. Basic stuff like simple leg swings can make a huge difference over the long run:
We also work on ankle mobility and stabilization (a topic I wrote about last month), as this is huge in any squatting pattern. You’ll also find that soccer players and baseball athletes (both pitchers and hitters) will have deficits between their “plant” leg and their free leg. Don’t just work on one ankle – work them both to bring them up equally!
There’s also a bit of static stretching involved prior to our lifts – I know, I know. Static stretching before lifting or power-based movements has gotten a bad reputation. However, like many controversial topics, it has been vastly overblown. Static stretching of the hip flexors prior to squatting or jumping has been shown to improve performance and working the agonist/antagonist relationships (hanging from the chin-up bar prior to bench press, for example) tends to help a lot as well.
One of our favorite static stretches – the “Ichiro” stretch
We use resistance bands quite a bit between sets and prior to lifting to get the blood flowing throughout the body and to increase mobility in important areas. We’ll often do some facepulls and general scapular mobility work, X-band walks and other glute activation work, and simple internal/external ROM work for the shoulder.
I hope that this article helps you to think about warming up for weight training – and sports in general – a little differently, and perhaps more seriously. You can pick up resistance bands or mobility/flexibility products from our respective Products pages. Give them a shot – I bet you’ll notice a big difference next time you’re in the gym!
You may also want to check out a great tool called “The Stick”.  I have a very close friend who is a trainer with the Blue Jays, who uses The Stick with his athletes.
Thanks, Ken. We absolutely use a version of “The Stick” using 1/2″ PVC covered in 3/4″ PVC and wrapped in dense foam with some makeshift handles. Works extremely well – especially on the calves!

Link: Unstable Surface Training - Driveline Baseball,2010-01-28T12:56:39+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/01/link-unstable-surface-training/,"My friend and colleague Cameron at SFB Fitness has written a great piece on personal trainers and how they implement crazy techniques that impress the average gym-goer but don’t get actual results. The first target of his investigation? Unstable surface training.
While I have no doubt that Cameron’s whole series will be good, this article in particular is great. Occasionally I’ll go to the local LA Fitness to swim, row on the Concept2 (hey, they cost ~$5000 new!), throw medicine balls in their racquetball courts (that one gets some glares), or shoot hoops with some buddies. I always – and I do mean always – see personal trainers with their clients using the BOSU ball for some ridiculous exercise.
Yeah, I bet this is useful.
Anyway, I don’t want to steal the spotlight. Read Cameron’s article about it, and stay tuned to his website for further additions in the series!

Ankle mobility is extremely important in both baseball position players and pitchers. Since baseball is such a unilateral sport, players will often have deficits in one ankle but not the other – this is even more pronounced in pitchers. Be sure to keep your heel on the ground, and add this stretch into your routine before and after your workouts, games, and practices.

It’s a quick six-page read, yet it contains insightful wisdom that I wholly agree with and preach on a daily basis.

Overtraining: A Serious Problem - Driveline Baseball,2009-12-16T04:05:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2009/12/overtraining-a-serious-problem/,"Stop me if you’ve heard this before: Conditioning month is meant to bring out the best in the high school athlete. It’s a punishing routine, often run twice per day at obscene hours (5 AM morning session, 6 PM evening session) where the men are separated from the boys. The morning session involves running 2 miles to “warm up,” followed by intense 100 meter sprints and other xpxlyometricxx work. Puking is common and is taken as a sign that the workout is hard enough and the coach is doing his job.
In the evening, the players convene for skill work – the soccer players run hours of foot skill drills, exhausted from the morning session, while the football players practice hitting and tackling if they’re not in the weight room performing quarter-squats with 600 pounds on their back. Basketball players are running ladders, suicides, testing their vertical leap, and jumping over xpxlyometricxx hurdles – all the while feeling a burning sensation in their shins but unwilling to speak up to the coach about it. Because after all, no one wants to think that you’re not tough enough, right?
Wrong.
High school coaches are singlehandedly responsible for dogging their athletes and pushing them well past their physical, mental, and psychological limitations. The ones who succeed on these absurd five-day-a-week programs with four or more hours of intense work are the genetic freaks, the ones who are truly the outliers. The ones who fail and suffer injuries are deemed “weak” and not worthy of making the team. The rest plod through it, nursing their “soreness” (in actuality, these are injuries), icing their bodies, and sleeping for hours on end, hoping the pain will go away in time for the season to start. Training is not like a game or sitting in an armchair reading a book – the human body has limits. This ‘eggs against the wall’ training philosophy, where throw enough eggs against a wall and hope that one will end up at the Olympics (but forget about 5,000 that you wrecked), has serious shortcomings. Athletes lose 30 pounds in a month, slash their 40 yard dash time, and increase the weights on their squats that closely resemble a bad leg press rather than a true full squat. Progress was made – the ends justify the means.
Wrong.
High school athletes are often rank novices – they are thoroughly unadapted to stress and can be pushed to their limit every time they train because they have no previous experience! Novices do not get stronger when they train, they get stronger when they recover. Overtraining is when you push an individual past his limitations and do not respect the time it takes to recovery from a workout that disrupts homeostasis. Overloading is when you design a program that disrupts homeostasis – good programs overload, but do not overtrain.
An example of an excellent novice program is that of Mark Rippetoe’s Starting Strength – the novice lifter works every other day, increasing the weight on all of his lifts (Back Squat, Press, Bench Press, Deadlift, Power Clean) every session. This is the linear progression model. The athlete gets one day off between workouts and two on the weekends, though adding a “metabolic conditioning” workout on one of those days is not a terrible idea (as long as there is one day of recovery before the next heavy lifting day).
The ideal novice training cycle looks something like this:
The first step is then repeated. However, if the load phase is started too late after supercompensation, then the effects are mitigated and the athlete may return to the base level of fitness. Confused? This excellent graph from Footballdrills.com should help:
More after the jump…
An ideal training cycle can be graphically represented like so:
The straight line is the linear progression of the resistance used while the curves are simply the same graphic from the supercompensation image above. There is a load which must be recovered from, supercompensation occurs, then the athlete trains harder and repeats the cycle until he can no longer do so. When recovery becomes an issue, the athlete should reset the load and attempt to progress in a linear fashion again, and when the athlete hits the wall once more, he should consider intermediate programming.
Intermediate programming is a subject of another post, but to briefly explain it, it is planning your workouts a week in advance rather than simply increasing the load every workout. Intermediate trainees can not recover quickly enough from the load required to disrupt homeostasis to simply add weight over and over again, and so they need to plan a bit further in advance. Most athletes will never progress past intermediate programming and can see gains from this type of programming for years.
A sample training / conditioning program from your average high school coach looks something like this:
This is constant training without regard or respect for a recovery cycle, and it leads to a decreased capability level. While strict novices may still see gains overall, they will progress at a much slower rate due to overtraining and stress.
One high school student that I previously coached is an excellent athlete, though he could stand to gain 30 or 40 pounds (this is true for nearly every high school athlete). He was an outstanding center fielder, leadoff hitter, and from what I hear, a great shooting guard. He’s in the conditioning program for basketball now, and he recently told me:
Everyday this week I’ve had weightlifting and sprint workouts with less than 16 hrs rest on Friday. Today I did a 20 min recovery jog and then elevated legs for 10 mins and then iced for 3 hrs and when that didn’t work I put on some icyhot and foam rolling… I’m still as sore as I started!
To put it bluntly, this is absolutely unacceptable. This athlete is not “sore.” He is injured. When range of motion is compromised and pain levels do not go away, that’s not normal soreness. That is an injury due to a stupidly designed program by a coach who has no training or education in exercise science who is simply repeating the programs that he suffered through in high school, college, or possibly the professional ranks of sport.
My advice to him was:
You need to not do so much hard ****. I realize this may not be an option since your coaches don’t know how to make a realistic training program, but that’s the truth.
Assuming that you aren’t going to change your coaches’ minds (and you shouldn’t try to, anyway), you should sleep, foam roll, contrast baths (take an ice bath – yes, a FULL ice bath – then drain and immediately take a hot shower; yes this is painful as hell), and eat, eat, EAT.
The last point cannot be overstated. You need to eat 6000 calories per day. No, that number is not a joke. Start eating pizza every day. A lot of it. And McDonalds.
I am serious.
Unfortunately, the solution for overtraining athletes involves using a search engine for more than 10 minutes and maybe taking a class or two on proper exercise science – and we all know that people simply aren’t interested in learning things that are contrary to their rock-solid beliefs.
Train your athletes hard – design a program that makes them sweat, curse, and struggle. But understand that recovery is a necessary part of training, and without it, you are wasting your time and potentially opening up your athletes to injury to salve your ego.

Are all novices the same? - Driveline Baseball,2009-12-08T03:45:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2009/12/are-all-novices-the-same/,"In the world of exercise physiology and science, there are four levels of training – Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Elite. These levels represent the trainee’s ability to recover from workouts and adapt to the stress levels imposed on them by their training. Everyone who starts on a good strength training protocol will be a novice, even if they’ve bench pressed and curled a lot in their past. The amount of stress needed to produce an adaptation for a novice trainee is small enough that they can recover from in it 48 hours. They progress from workout to workout and require very basic programming.
Nearly everyone that I train has been a novice, and as such, they are all put on very similar programming. All novice trainees at Driveline Baseball will follow a program similar to Mark Rippetoe’s Starting Strength program with concessions and adaptations for baseball players (example: substituting dumbbell bench press for barbell bench press).
The front squat: Commonly used at Driveline Baseball.
All trainees will definitely perform some variant of the following exercises: Squat, Overhead Press, Bench Press, Deadlift, Row, and Chin-Ups/Pull-Ups. As an example of a squat variant, most of the pitchers will use the front squat, as this is a lot easier on the shoulders than the traditional back squat. Additionally, all trainees will perform some sort of Rate of Force Development exercise – speed squats, deadlifts, power cleans, power snatches, medball cleans, medball slams, and so forth.
In personal training, it’s very important to fit the programming to the individual. However, it’s also important to note that all novices are virtually the same when it comes to programming needs – they all require basic compound-lift-centric programming that they can recover from within 48 hours. Novices can recover quickly and make rapid gains, and to waste this precious time in the training cycle would be a grave error.
Concessions for individuals can be made based on sport-specific and anatomical needs – substituting the front squat for the back squat, for example – but trainers should never lose focus on the end goal: Rapid gains throughout the compound lifts that make up the majority of the program.
So, to answer this blog post’s question – Are all novices the same? – the answer is “Yes. For the most part.”

Should you wear a weight belt? - Driveline Baseball,2009-12-03T06:56:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2009/12/should-you-wear-a-weight-belt/,"You’ve seen them in the weight room at your local globogym – big hulking dudes that look like bodybuilders with big belts in the back and small straps in the front. It might look something like this:
Typical belt seen at your local globogym.
The guys wearing these sweet belts are doing tricep pressdowns on the cable machine using the rope attachment, they’re doing curls with the 60 lb. EZ-curl bars, and they’re bouncing their bench press reps off their chest.
Let’s get one thing straight: These belts suck and so do the lifters who use them.
The reason that you use a belt is to give the abs something to push against – therefore making them work harder in the squat, deadlift, press, and bench press. The belt pictured above is small in the front, giving your abs basically nothing to push against! These belts are designed to “support the back,” which completely misses the mark on why you would use a belt in the first place. Gary Gibson on the Starting Strength message board put it very well:
The belt allows one to squat more weight NOT because it provides rebound…and not because the belt itself increases the necessary intra-abdominal pressure. The belt gives the abs something to push against so that the ABS THEMSELVES can provide more pressure. The belt just allows the abs to generate more tension by providing external resistance…just like a freaking weighted barbell on your back allows you to generate more tension than just flexing your lower body muscles really hard without the barbell as you stand up.
A journal article was printed regarding belts and their effect in both the conventional and the sumo stance deadlift. The results were:
Results: … Compared with the no-belt condition, the belt condition produced significantly greater rectus abdominis activity and significantly less external oblique activity.
Yep, as Gary said, the belt helps the abs work harder and it decreases the strain on the obliques – both good things!
Now, a proper belt will be 3-4 inches tall and 10mm thick all the way around – no taper. Most lifters should use a 4″ belt unless they have a short torso and less than normal room between the top of their ribcage and the iliac crest, in which case a 3″ belt is probably best. 13mm thick belts are for super strongmen and powerlifters and take forever to break in and use, so they’re probably not something that is applicable for the average athlete.
I personally own the following APT belt:
This belt rules.
It’s a single-prong model, which is a lot easier to get on and off, and it was reasonably priced at $50 plus S&H from their website. I even had to return my first one because I mismeasured my belt size (it goes around your belly button, not your waist) and the exchange process was simple and easy.
You might want to get a belt tightener tool so you can wear the belt extremely tightly around the midsection. They look something like this:
However, these seemingly-simple tools cost about $40-50 from various stores online! It’s pretty expensive for a piece of metal. I will say that they are extremely useful, though – it’s very difficult to get the desired tightness around the midsection by yourself, and unless you have really strong friends, once you use this tool, you won’t go back (I feel this way myself).
So if your squat is stalling and you’re at the end of your novice program, it might be time to invest in a nice belt. I use an APT belt, but there are a lot of good companies – many of my friends use Inzer with great success. Just be sure to get a single-pronged (or lever) belt that’s 10mm thick and 4″ tall unless you have a short torso.

Free Weight Squats > Smith Machine Squats - Driveline Baseball,2009-12-02T06:39:07+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2009/12/free-weight-squats-smith-machine-squats/,"This is something the strength training community has known for awhile, but free weight squats are vastly better for performance training than smith machine squats. Additionally, since the Smith machine restricts your range of motion in one or more planes of movement (depending on the machine and exercise in question), it is inherently injurious as it leaves out the development of stabilizing muscles.
Don't use this. Also, this guy has terrible squat form.
Here is a study recently published that backs this up:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19855308
Electromyographic activity was significantly higher by 34%, 26%, and 49% in the gastrocnemius, biceps femoris, and vastus medialis, respectively, during the free weight squat compared to the Smith machine squat (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between free weight and Smith machine squat for any of the other muscles; however, the EMG averaged over all muscles during the free weight squat was 43% higher when compared to the Smith machine squat (p < 0.05). The free weight squat may be more beneficial than the Smith machine squat for individuals who are looking to strengthen plantar flexors, knee flexors, and knee extensors.
…
The free weight squat may be superior to the Smith machine squat for training the major muscle groups of the legs and possibly would result in greater strength development and hypertrophy of these muscle groups with long-term training.
So get off those stupid machines and learn to train with free weights!
