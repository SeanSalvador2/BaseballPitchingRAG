Off-Season Workload Progression using Pulse - Driveline Baseball,2022-05-13T22:38:56+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/05/off-season-workload-progression-using-pulse/,"By Stephen Hart, Pitching Coordinator
Pitchers, especially high-level pitchers, are creatures of habit.  Most pitchers have a specific warm-up routine, a pregame playlist, and a pre-pitch routine. Some may even have a routine throwing program they utilize after their season ends. For many, it is common to take 2-3 months off from throwing. For some, this routine can work. But for many, this routine can leave a lot of player development on the table as that throwing timeline leaves hardly any time to improve their arsenal, velocity, or command.  Such was the case for one of our professional athletes before he reported for Spring Training.Proposing to start throwing 1-2 months earlier in an offseason can create some hesitation among high-level pitchers. At Driveline, we have found that intelligently building our athletes back to season form using insights from Pulse helps ease that feeling of hesitation for athletes.  This blog will outline how we, and any coach, can use Pulse to help ensure our athletes are prepared for Day 1 of Spring Training, the opening weekend of conference play, and improve their chances of success.  Specifically, we’ll cover:
1. On ramping program to prepare his body for higher intensity training.  Leveraged overload balls exclusively to help keep peak torques lower by helping him regulate his intensity.2. Gradually introduce lighter weight balls to build up throwing fitness and introduce the body to higher (on average) torque values.3. Reinforce arsenal changes using Trackman, Edgertronic, and Intended Zone tracking while continuing to push torque values higher before ST.
In the example below, we’ll show what numbers we used to monitor training that was done remotely.
There are a lot of metrics that can be found and tracked using Pulse. Many can be quite valuable for training! Some of these metrics include 1-day workload (1DW), chronic workload (CW), torque, arm speed, arm slot, number of throws, high effort throws, and fatigue units. Amongst all the metrics, the primary metrics we paid close attention to were 1DW, average torque, and chronic WL. Let’s review these metrics and how they applied to our athlete’s training. Put simply, 1DW is a number that quantifies the amount of throwing an athlete does on any given day and at what intensity. This includes any plyocare throws, catch play, long toss, etc. It’s a simple, tangible number that provides feedback on the athlete’s throwing.  Where generally, lighter throwing days will yield a lower 1DW, while our bullpen or game days will yield a higher 1DW. One can think of prescribing 1DWs as using (recommended) guard rails on our athlete’s training volume.However, not all 1DWs are created equal, as the throwing intensity component must be considered. For example, two athletes can have the same 1DW, but the time it can take to reach that 1DW can be very different based on how hard they are throwing (i.e. their intensity). In other words, you can throw a lot at a lower intensity, OR you can throw less at a higher intensity and reach the same 1DW.  So, if 1DW is very valuable yet doesn’t tell the whole story of an athlete’s training session, what complementary metric can we use to give us insights into the throwing intensity of the session?  This is where average torque comes into play. The harder the athlete throws in a given session, assuming the athlete places the sensor correctly, the higher his average torque. Conveniently, both these numbers are athlete/coach facing and can be found right on the main screen in the Pulse app. This can be seen below in the examples of a bullpen (left) and recovery (right) day.
In this way, I view 1DW and average torque as complementary metrics that give me a sense of throwing volume and intensity.  I think all coaches should be able to monitor these two critical variables in our programs.  The hidden power of monitoring these metrics is twofold :
Nearly all of the onboarding and time spent gaining familiarity with the Pulse app was done in person during his initial assessment.  This was also a great time to discuss the ‘what,’ ‘where,’ and ‘why’ with all things feedback related to his training using Pulse.
Overall the off-season program was a great success.  We were able to improve his arsenal (via the addition of a new pitch), but we could intelligently build up our athlete’s throwing fitness to better prepare his body for Spring Training than in previous years.  Not to mention our athlete was able to hit an off-season PR of 94.
As discussed earlier, breaking or creating new habits can be an uphill battle for some athletes.  Leveraging resources such as Pulse and using it as a guide to provide direction for programming and throwing progression is invaluable.

PULSE EDGE Report: A Throwing Workload Snapshot - Driveline Baseball,2022-02-01T23:35:44+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/02/pulse-edge-report-a-throwing-workload-snapshot/,"By Kyle Lindley, Pulse Product Manager, Sports Science Asst. Manager
The purpose of the PULSE Pitching Report is to describe an athlete’s workload and workout intensity over the time period chosen for the report. Evaluating workload and workout intensity can help guide training suggestions and make sure athletes are following their throwing program to get the most out of their training.
In the words of Dean Jackson: “It doesn’t matter how perfect your throwing program is. If it isn’t performed correctly then you will get better slower and be at a higher risk for injury.“
Report Description: A set of player averages from the specific imported PULSE data compared to five playing-level averages of all qualified PULSE users.
Note: All playing-level averages are constructed from 5 oz ball weights only. Conditional green and red shades are applied to the PULSE metrics below, based on the imported player being either 0.5 Standard Deviations above (green) or below (red) the selected playing-level averages (in this case the selected level was: affiliate)!
Use this page to compare your average PULSE metrics in the time period of the report to the averages of all different playing levels. Generally, PULSE’s strength is in comparing an athlete’s data to their own data, as opposed to comparing data between athletes. Keep that in mind, and don’t draw any significant mechanical conclusions based on this page
Top 8th Arm Speed Distributions and Top 8th Elbow Torque Distributions
Compare the distribution of your peak torques and arm speeds to the distributions of all different playing levels. Pay more attention to the arm speed metric on this page when comparing you or your athlete to the rest of the groups.
There is more differentiation between playing levels with the torque metric, and that is primarily because of two things:
Generally, PULSE’s strength is in comparing an athlete’s data to their own data as opposed to comparing data between athletes. Keep that in mind, and don’t draw any significant mechanical conclusions based on this page, either.
Top plot:
Examine workout intensity over time. Top 8th torque is a good measure for peak intensity for each day and average torque is a good measure for average intensity for each day. You’ll want to see more uniformity than randomness and an oscillation of intensity.
Interpreting top 8th and average torque:
You don’t always want to be blowing it out; you also don’t always want to be taking it easy (unless maybe if you are on a special program). Make sure you’re loading your body appropriately with your throwing program.
Bottom plot:
Examine 1-day workloads over the time period of the report.
This page is a really good overall summary of workload over the report’s time period because it describes both intensity and overall workload for all of the dates included in the report.
Report Description: Average/Top 8th Elbow Torque and the Average One-Day Workload by Workout/Exercise
Top plot:
Compare workouts and/or throw types’ average torques. This is a measure of intensity—average intensity. This plot should be used to make sure that you or your athlete are completing specific workouts and exercises with appropriate intensity.
Bottom plot:
Compare the one-day workload between different workouts and exercises. This plot helps you determine whether:
Based on you or your athletes’ needs, make sure proper workout and exercise distribution is being used to address those needs.
Report Description: Daily Arm Speed and Top 8th Arm Speed Distributions
Top plot:
Similar to the top plot on page 3, this plot helps you gauge average and peak throwing intensity over time. In most cases, you’ll want to see some sort of oscillation in intensity—kick up the intensity for velocity workouts, high intensity mound work, or games, but then also drop down the intensity to allow for recovery and volume work.
Top 8th and average arm speed can be interpreted the same as top 8th and average torque.
Bottom plot:
This plot is very similar to the top plot on page 4 but with arm speed instead of torque. Use this plot to either:
Report Description: Number of Sessions and Number of Throws by Workout/Exercise
Top plot:
Number of sessions for each workout or exercise. This is just to give you or your athlete an idea for what type of throwing makes up most of the throwing program. If you were training for velocity, you wouldn’t want all of your sessions to be hybrid B’s or all pivot picks; you’d want to make sure there is an appropriate balance between velocity workouts and low intensity workouts.
Bottom plot:
This plot shows the typical volume for each of the throwing workouts or exercises. Make sure that all of you or your athlete’s throwing economy isn’t going to places that won’t help them achieve their training goals.
Short summaries to read for learning more about PULSE as well as links to read the whole publication. This is a very important page for learning athletes or athletes who are curious about how workload can be used to improve performance and health.
A lot of these are blogs on the drivelinebaseball.com blog, which is another really good place to learn a thing or two about PULSE
____________________________________________________________________________
Appropriate workload management is paramount to reaching peak performance and staying healthy which requires the manipulation of volume and intensity. The problem? The main feedback for athletes on volume and intensity comes from one thing–they either feel good or they don’t. It’s hard to make the right adjustments without descriptive feedback.
Think of workload as a combination of two dials: volume and intensity. Once the two dials are put in front of you, you can start to adjust them to reach peak performance. The PULSE EDGE Report gives you those dials.
Want to get started? Start by collecting a few weeks of PULSE data with some general guidelines based on your goals, how much you’ve been throwing, etc., then run this report to review. Make sure that your low-intent days are actually low intent, your high-intent days are actually high-intent, and that you are not spending all of your training economy on the wrong exercises.
Get the most out of your training program. #EveryThrowCounts

Arm Care for Position Players - Driveline Baseball,2022-01-19T17:41:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/01/arm-care-for-position-players/,"Written by JP Fasone – Hitting Trainer
In my experience, position players rarely go the whole season without arm pain. It’s no surprise that arm care gets moved to the back burner, behind offensive and defensive work, but arm care doesn’t need to be complicated or time-consuming.
If you understand how to ease into high intent and high volume throwing, while also managing recovery time throughout the year, you can mitigate injury risk and arm pain.
On-ramping aims to slowly expose the body to increasing amounts of stress, also referred to as workload, over an extended period of time. The body’s soft tissue, muscles, tendons, ligaments, etc., will lengthen to adapt to long-term stress. For example, if you stretched your hamstring every morning for 6-weeks, your hamstring’s resting state would have lengthened, making it easier to stretch (i.e., handle the workload). This allows the body to protect itself against injury, but it also works the opposite way.
Without exposure to stress, the soft tissue’s resting state contracts. Imagine never stretching your hamstring, then going out and doing max effort sprints. You would probably expect to pop your hamstring because the contracted muscle is unprepared to accept the force that sprinting puts on it. Jumping back into a full schedule of high intent, high volume throwing after a summer of (for most athletes) minimal to inconsistent throwing causes a spike in workload and increases the risk of injury.
We need to slowly work up to an in-season throwing workload by on-ramping athletes from lower volume and intensities to higher volume and in-game intensities, gradually allowing the soft tissue to adapt. As a general rule, on-ramping should last as long as the player’s time off from throwing, with a maximum of 6-weeks.
Coaches and athletes can do this by monitoring the intent and number of throws athletes make week to week. By dividing the days into hybrid A days (80-90% intent), hybrid B days (60-70% intent), and recovery days (<60% intent), we can schedule a basic on-ramping program.
You can change this schedule based on your practice schedule and the athlete’s relative arm fitness, but the principle remains true. By slowly building more high intent, high volume days into the program, we allow the body to adapt to the increased stress over time, decreasing the risk of injury.
Once the athlete has completed their on-ramping phase, we can shift our attention to maintaining the athlete’s workload. Thinking back to our hamstring example, we want to continue to keep our workload high enough to maintain our positive adaptations, without adding so much workload that the body can’t recover. We can do this by using two guide rails: chronic and acute workload.
Our goal is to keep the athlete’s chronic workload (average workload over 28 days) as close to their acute workload (average workload over the last 9 days) as possible. So, how do we do that? We can think about acute workload like a weekly allowance.
On day 1, the athlete has a dollar to spend for the week. The athlete should spend as close to a dollar as they can every week. So, if an athlete spends more than a dollar on a recovery day (by making a ton of throws), on the next day they should lower the volume and/or intensity to make up for the workload used on the recovery day. Workload management is like a diet; it’s not about being perfect—it’s about building good habits.
The most crucial part of arm care is communicating with the athlete. No throwing program is perfect because no two athletes are the same.
If they have some soreness, maybe add more low intent days or cut down on the volume. If they feel like they have more in the tank, we can add more moderate/high intent days or increase the volume. Remember, we want to look at long-term averages. If athlete A mentions some arm pain and nothing stands out as a significant issue, coaches should check in with that athlete over the next week to see if the problem persists.
If adjustments are needed, the coach should monitor the athlete to see if the changes helped resolve the issue. This sounds simple, but it hinges on actively communicating with athletes about their arm health. Luckily, some technologies can help facilitate these conversations.
Position players need to take care of their arms just as much as pitchers. By properly on-ramping and monitoring workload, it is simple to keep arms healthy throughout the year. Using technologies like Pulse to keep track of how athletes’ workloads are changing over the year, coaches and athletes can use ACR and the self-reported Arm Health metric to have productive conversations.
The goal of any throwing program should be to keep athletes healthy. Listen to the athlete, make minor adjustments, prioritize recovery, and you will be on your way to a healthier arm.
Need help keeping your arm healthy? In-gym and remote options are both available.

New to PULSE? Here's what to expect in the first month,2021-12-07T01:57:31+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/12/new-to-pulse-heres-what-to-expect-in-the-first-month/,"By Kyle Lindley, Sports Science Asst. Manager, PULSE Project Manager
Workload and throwing routines can and should be very individualized—different players have different needs when it comes to intensity and volume.
The same way that some athletes need different exercises, volume, and intensity in the weight room, throwers should have appropriately shaped routines to address their own needs. How can we determine what kind of workouts a thrower needs? Starting the data collection process is the first step.
To use PULSE to reliably shape your throwing program, you need to have first collected enough background data. The first month of using PULSE is built to include a series of ‘unlocks’ on a week-by-week basis until you have built a baseline level of data to base programming changes on. Let’s break it down.
So you got started using PULSE—what should you expect from the first month?
It’s best to set some goals for throwing volume and intensity, then monitor those in real-time or after your sessions. You can monitor them live with Live Mode in the advanced tab (far right bottom tab) of the iOS app, or review the data after your session by looking back on the summary metrics on the main screen of the app.
You can also view this data after your sessions on pulsethrow.drivelinebaseball.com using the same login information as the app. The information you’re looking for can be found on the Dashboard (main page) or the Interday Data tab of the Long Term Trends page.
Without experience using PULSE, it’s tough to know where to start with workload, volume, and intensity goals. David Besky (data scientist at Driveline) put together this blog with average metrics for different drills and exercises which can be a helpful starting point, and we also listed some rough guidelines below.
Goals: Start collecting PULSE data, set some reasonable starting volume and intensity goals, and get comfortable wearing your PULSE for all throwing
Using some context information including time of year, your goals, and a general estimate of your current arm strength/throwing fitness, you can determine a good starting point for Week 1 volume and intensity goals.
Think about how much throwing you’ve done in the last month to guide these goals.
Use these reasonable guidelines to guide your first week:
If you’ve thrown less than 2 times per week in the last month:
If you’ve thrown 3 or 4 times per week in the last month:
If you’ve thrown 5+ times per week in the last month:
*Note: These are rough guidelines. None of these are hard and fast rules.
Goals: Continue collecting PULSE data for all throwing, tune your throwing based on first week
The primary goal is to continue collecting data, but you can use the first week of throwing to adjust volume and intensity goals based on the data that was collected. If you don’t feel recovered enough, maybe dial it back a bit by reducing total throws, one-day workloads, or intensity for some of the days. On the other hand, if you didn’t feel like you got enough work in, ramp up the throw count or intensity ever so slightly.
Tip: To look back at the workload data from your previous days of throwing, you can either swipe left and right on the main screen in the iOS app or select the dates at the top of the screen to navigate to a different day.
After the second week, you should have enough data to start interpreting the acute workload, chronic workload, and acute to chronic workload metrics more reliably.
Goals: Set a chronic workload goal and start paying attention to Acute to Chronic Workload Ratio (ACR)
If you’re not familiar, chronic workload is the average one-day workload over the last 28 days, and acts as a measure for throwing fitness. A good generic chronic workload range goal to shoot for when fully on-ramped is between 8 and 15 for adult athletes. For youth athletes (9 – 14ish years old), it often ranges between 3 and 9 because of physical development differences (height and weight). Use this table for chronic workload reference ranges:
ACR compares your acute workload (average one-day workload for the last 9 days) to your chronic workload. When you’re on-ramping (for 16+ y/o’s), your chronic workload will be less than about 8 and you want your ACR to be between 1 and about 1.5. When you’re no-longer on-ramping, you should have a chronic workload above 8 and you want your ACR to stay between 0.7 and 1.3ish on average.
Tip: You can view your ACR and your chronic workload by clicking on the ‘Max Recommended 1-Day Workload’ on the main screen of the iOS app. The ACR and Chronic workload will be highlighted in the description.
Goals: Use PULSE workload and intensity metrics to make sure you’re getting the most out of your throwing program
Once you have enough data collected on your PULSE account, this is when the fun really gets started. You have the opportunity to find what works best for you:
The opportunities to optimize your throwing program are endless.
PULSE gives you the ability to make sure YOU are getting the most out of YOUR program. If you are measuring your throwing on days that you feel great, and also days that you don’t feel so great, you can easily answer the question: What is different between these days?
Get going on maximising your results, and make the most of your career. Measure it.

Pulse Throw App Updates - Driveline Baseball,2021-11-30T01:48:29+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/11/pulse-throw-app-updates/,"By Kyle Lindley, PULSE Product Manager
Two new features were added to PULSE Throw iOS version 8.8:
We are constantly working to make your workload management experience as simple, robust, and pain-free as possible—this time, we’ve added battery level indicators to show if the sensor needs to be charged so data does not get missed, as well as an easier way to add workload data to an athlete’s profile if they throw without their sensor.
After you open the PULSE Throw app and go to an athlete profile, you should see a red outline of a sensor with a gray ‘X’ in it, showing that a sensor is not currently connected to the phone. After connecting a sensor, the sensor icon will show how much battery is left.
Based on the number of bars in the sensor icon, you can determine if there is enough charge to get through the throwing workout without charging:
Full: 5 – 8 hours of use remaining*
Sufficient: 3 – 5 hours of use remaining*
Low: 1-2 hours of use remaining*
Critical: < 45 min of use remaining*
Critical: No battery left, charge before throwing
*Battery life time estimates are based on new and slightly used sensors. Battery life capacity decreases over the lifetime of the sensor.
Note: Any time the sensor is off the charger, it is powered on and the battery will lose charge. To keep the sensor at full charge it must be left on the charger.
You can now copy a previous day’s data to a later date. This feature was added to make it easier to fill in missing workload data if an athlete is unable to wear their sensor for a throwing session or if the sensor does not capture throws.
Example: You’re an athlete and today you threw Plyo Ball ® and longtoss, but you forgot your sensor at home. This is a common throwing routine for you on your low intensity days, so last week you completed an almost identical routine. Instead of missing out on today’s workload data, you can copy your similar workout from last week to today’s date, which serves as a good estimate for today’s workload.
How to add workload to a day of throwing:

Four Ways to use Driveline PULSE: Getting the Most Out of PULSE Lite,2021-09-29T00:33:55+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/four-ways-to-use-driveline-pulse-getting-the-most-out-of-pulse-lite/,"By Kyle Lindley, Driveline PULSE Product Manager, Sports Science Asst. Manager
Driveline PULSE helps you manage workload—even if you don’t have all of the bells and whistles.
Two effective options for managing a team of athletes and their workloads are premium subscriptions to PULSE DASH and integrating PULSE with TRAQ. But you can also manage workload effectively without them. Here are a few ways to prepare your staff to dominate on a small budget:
In-game pitch counts give an incomplete picture of throwing workload. Having your players wear PULSE sensors throughout their entire practice, game, or throwing-involved workout gives you a better picture of how many total throws they execute each day. This goes for pitchers AND position players.
Whether you have players working out in a different location, playing different positions, or just have limited hands to monitor throw counts for all of your athletes, PULSE makes it easy to know if any of your players are throwing too much or not enough.
How to review your players’ throw counts:
During breaks in the season or when coming out of the off-season, players often need to on-ramp to an in-season level of throwing fitness. PULSE takes the math out of how much your players should be throwing at those times.
You choose which days your players should throw and then PULSE will prescribe a 1-day workload that will help build throwing fitness while minimizing the players’ chances of over-throwing.
How to set a training schedule and on-ramp your players:
The Max Recommended 1-Day Workload on the athlete’s dashboard should now reflect a prescribed workload for each throwing day that will build their chronic workload to prepare them for the season.
It’s very difficult to know exactly how much throwing goes on during practices, games, recovery workouts, and other training days. Using the tag feature when syncing throws, you can label throws from the day by workout type and compare total throw counts, high effort throw counts, and 1-day workloads to evaluate the long-term effects each workout is having on an athlete’s performance.
How to tag all throws from the day:
Using Bullpen Mode in PULSE, you can improve focus and intention during bullpens by charting what pitch is being thrown, where the intended location of the pitch is, where the actual pitch was located, and review bullpen performance after completing the session.
How to plan and chart bullpens with PULSE:
Here’s one example: individualized in-game pitch count guidelines/recommendations. Universal pitch count limits are not it. Two different athletes, or even the same athlete on two different days, should not always use the same pitch count recommendation. PULSE helps you choose an individualized pitch count guideline for your player based on their recent throwing history, as well as on the long-term throwing fitness they have built up. This is going to be different for all athletes.
How to get individualized pitch count recommendations:
Workload management is imperative for an effective pitching staff, and Driveline PULSE can do that for you. You can do more and learn more with premium TRAQ and PULSE DASH subscriptions (DASH Pro), but PULSE alone arms you with the essential tools for preparing your pitching staff to dominate.
If you are in the market for a PULSE workload management package, learn more about how easy it is to get started here. Create a profile, put the sensor and strap on your arm, and go through your throwing routine as usual!

How the Cincinnati Reds Used PULSE to More Effectively Manage Their Pitching Staff - Driveline Baseball,2021-08-26T01:10:39+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/how-the-cincinnati-reds-used-pulse-to-more-effectively-manage-their-pitching-staff/,"Written by Joe Marsh
This blog is the third post in our series of blogs highlighting successful implementations of PULSE. You can check out the first blog here.
This one will focus on how Kyle Boddy (yes, the founder of Driveline) implemented PULSE with the Reds this past year.
Becoming the Director of Pitching for the Reds meant that Boddy was responsible for every pitcher, and every pitching coach in the Reds minor league system.
In particular, Boddy knew he could refine how pitchers were managed and used during the season. Typical innings and pitch counts don’t actually capture if a pitcher is really ready to throw – and Boddy knew that PULSE could be the solution.
He began implementing PULSE throughout the organization with the help of the man in our last blog — Bryan Conger, Boddy’s pitching coordinator.
The first way Boddy and the Reds were able to leverage PULSE was by managing fatigue in their pitchers’ pregame routines.
Boddy noticed that his starting pitchers were typically gassed by the time they were ready to throw on the mound in a game. They would rip through warmups, Plyo Ball ®, long toss, and their pre-game bullpen one after the other and then go straight into the game. This would lead to more fatigue, more missed pitches, more walks, and more runs surrendered in the first innings of games.
Using PULSE, Bryan Conger noticed that their fatigue units — a live measure of a pitcher’s fatigue — during their pregame routine would be through the roof, and certainly well above the recommended threshold.
Fatigue units are modelled to evaluate the effects of forces, cycle times, and postures on muscle fatigue during repetitive tasks, like throwing. They create a better representation of the fatigue that a pitcher accrues compared to inning or pitch counts. A full blog detailing fatigue units can be found here.
At Conger’s suggestion, Boddy decided to implement Conger’s idea: Regulate the pregame routines of their pitchers by mandating 3 minute breaks between each phase of their throwing program: Plyo Ball ®/weighted ball work, longtoss, pregame bullpen, and finally, the game.
They noticed their pitchers were actually looking fresh when going into the game and, more importantly, walks and runs went down in their first inning.
There’s also a natural pairing between fatigue units and heart rate that is currently being investigated. By pairing heart rate data and other recovery-based metrics with PULSE and fatigue units, Boddy and the Reds hope to have the full picture of how ready their pitchers are to throw, and how they recover.
Managing starter workload in-season is an integral part of ensuring pitchers can perform at their full potential — this exact issue was detailed in the first blog in this series.
But professional baseball has an added twist, in that starters don’t throw once per week. They might throw on 7 days of rest, and sometimes they’ll throw on 4 days of rest. Managing short term fatigue with the added variability in scheduling is essential.
To do this, Boddy followed the outline pioneered by Conger — between-start throwing volume is adjusted based on how much the starter threw and when he’s scheduled to throw next. By using PULSE, they’re able to know exactly how much a pitcher needs to throw to make sure he’s fresh for his next start, while maintaining his throwing fitness.
In one example, a pitcher we’ll call Athlete 3 drew the Tuesday and Sunday starts — 4 days of rest in between starts.
He was prescribed low throwing volume recovery days during the week, along with an abbreviated lower intensity side-session to get some mound work in. These measures were successful in helping him recover, but still get some work done in between starts.
On gameday, by knowing Athlete 3’s pregame routine, they are able to simulate his workload data for the day and project what his chronic workload and A:C Ratios will be after he throws in a game — and how many pitches will keep him in a healthy range.
It’s important to note that A:C Ratio isn’t a strict guideline. It’s merely a good rule of thumb.
The plan was for Athlete C to go 60 pitches on Sunday. On gameday, he wound up throwing a bit less in his pregame than projected which left him room to extend his pitch count in the game a bit. But after the 4th inning and at 57 pitches, his velocity was starting to drop. So the coaches opted to pull him early.
Because a pitcher could safely throw more pitches according to PULSE, it doesn’t mean he should. There is more context to making decisions than just A:C Ratio.
Managing relievers is a beast in itself — you never know when you need a guy to throw, if he’s fresh, or if he needs an offday. PULSE helps navigate these waters. Boddy and his crew leverage PULSE to create player cards that guide pitcher usage in games.
By dividing the relievers into their own subteam, Boddy and his coaches can glance at the Dashboard on PULSE Dash and immediately see what pitchers are fresh, who needs rest, and who can be stretched out to 2-3 innings. Take a look at the screenshot below
It’s immediately obvious that the athlete highlighted in gray — who just threw — could be ready to go on one day of rest, with an expected A:C Ratio of 1.06 after an off day.
Another athlete – the one with their A:C Ratio flagged in yellow – was coming off of the IL and had just thrown live. He was expected to be activated and ready to throw tomorrow, but given that his A:C Ratio is at 1.31, the Reds opted to activate him a day later to minimize any unnecessary risk.
Using the information above, as well as the Gameday report available in PULSE Dash, Boddy’s coaches are able to create game cards that guide pitcher usage for the day. They look something like this:
Starters have their expected innings and pitch counts — based on PULSE workload data — and the available relievers are listed with their optimal inning and pitch counts. Sometimes a game gets out of hand — that’s where the emergency pitchers come in. They’re technically available, but it isn’t optimal to use them based on their current workloads.
A game doesn’t always go according to plan, and coaches have to be flexible. PULSE gives coaches the ability to make smart decisions for their game plan, and for when the game gets out of hand.
By using PULSE, Kyle and the Reds coaches have been able to manage their staff smartly and effectively across all levels. From adjusting throwing programs between outings, to managing pitcher usage in-game, and even fine-tuning the pregame routines of his pitchers, PULSE has been invaluable to the Reds this year.
Boddy’s thoughts about PULSE best sum up the success of the Reds implementation:
“It’s really absurd how much value PULSE confers and illustrates how we should actually be managing pitcher usage in games,” Boddy said. “It allows us to make smart decisions about how we use and prepare our pitchers that we wouldn’t otherwise have.”

How Different Drills and Ball Weights Affect an Athlete's Workload,2021-08-20T00:45:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/how-different-drills-and-ball-weights-affect-an-athletes-workload/,"By David Besky – Data Scientist
In any training program, in throwing as in lifting, the goal is to stress the body with an appropriate stimulus. The key is for this stimulus to be great enough to cause adaptation while also appropriate given the athlete’s needs and previous training such that they’ll be able to recover sufficiently to achieve that adaptation.
PULSE allows for precise tracking of throwing workload, and all you need to do is put the sensor on before throwing and sync the data post session (or mid-session if you want intermittent feedback to make on the fly adjustments).
Given that athletes will vary in terms of regulating volume and intensity, two athletes may differ moderately in terms of workload even when given the same instructions and program. With PULSE, you’re able to track that, provide individualized feedback, and adjust programming to optimize the athlete’s training.
That said, until you have a detailed picture of each athlete’s training habits, it can be helpful to have some ballpark numbers averaged across different athletes to create a rough framework for the workloads you want to prescribe, based on workout type, ball weight, and different drills.
Looking at data from our in-gym athletes, who have been using PULSE since September 2020, we can calculate those average values, as well as look at the variation between different athletes.
One of the main concerns when designing a program is determining how much an athlete should throw on a given day. This is dictated by their preparedness and desired/required throwing fitness goals or training state.
Generally, we recommend progressively increasing workload week over week when training during the offseason to avoid spiking the acute workload (workload for a given week) much over the level of throwing fitness the athlete has developed in prior weeks.
In our training programs, the desired throwing intensity and volume have historically been indicated by workout types as follows:
Below, we see the following average values of One Day Workload (a combined measure including number of throws for the day and intensity of those throws) for those different workout types:
Vertical lines indicate 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile values.
We see that the lower intensity throwing days (Recovery and Hybrid B days) generally have lower One Day Workloads, as might be expected.
Looking at those three main classes of velo days, we see that Plyo Ball ® velos have the lowest One Day Workloads in-gym on average, with a median One Day Workload of 14.0, compared to 17.8 for mound velos and 18.2 for pulldowns.
In addition to the cumulative One Day Workload, another consideration may be an athlete’s peak single throw torque on a given day. Generally, we’ll give more weight to One Day Workload as it incorporates the intensity of all throws and is not going to be as affected by an athlete cranking out a single throw at high intensity on submaximal days.
Still, especially in rehab settings, peak torque can be a useful check-point for ensuring that intensity is being increased as desired.
The other component of workload is total throws, so we can also break that down by day type:
The relatively higher workload days tend to be at least in part caused by athletes taking more throws on those days (rather than the increase being driven by intensity only).
And even though time doesn’t factor into cumulative workload, we can also compare how long athletes took to complete all their throws for different workouts using the time stamps on throws:
These times are just based on all the athlete’s throws on PULSE during the workout and thus do not include a general dynamic warm-up and non-throwing specific warm-up components (such as J-Bands, Wrist Weights, Shoulder Tube, etc.).
We see that our athletes usually spend 15-20 minutes throwing on recovery days, and between 25-50 minutes on other days, spending a bit longer on pulldown days than on other workout types, on average.
Within a workout, changing ball weight and using various constraint drills will have some effect on the workload of individual throws, so having a ballpark idea of the size of the effect may help you tailor programming as needed.
So, for example, if an athlete did 10 throws with the blue ball, that would on average be 1.57 workload units (10*0.157) towards their One Day Workload total. Alternatively, it’d take only about 5-6 (5.6 to be exact) gray ball throws to achieve that same cumulative workload (on average—individual athletes will differ, but these average values provide a starting point for comparing across different weights).
In addition to varying the number of throws an athlete will do with each ball weight, you may also vary drill volume for specific athletes based on what you want them to emphasize.
With a rough idea of how workload/torques vary between drills, we can make adjustments as necessary if switching the balance between the different drills.
While most of the actionable info comes from workload/torques, we can look at the other metrics as well to get an idea for any variation relevant to different drills:
We see that the more constrained drills like the pivot pickoff and the roll in, which are typically done with the heaviest balls, come in with the lowest average torques. They are typically used on recovery days more than the other drills, so that may bias the comparison slightly. Among the drills for which we’ll cycle through the four lighter balls (blue, red, yellow, gray), Janitors and Walking Windups have slightly higher torques than Step Backs and Drop Steps, across the different ball weights.
As with the torques, we see higher arm speeds for underload balls and less constrained drills.
We see a general trend where PULSE arm slots are a touch higher for heavier Plyo Ball ® (specifically the blue ball) within each of the less constrained drills that use all ball weights. The magnitude of difference in arm slots is only a couple degrees, but it’s interesting to see nonetheless (fully detailed in the table below).
Individual tracking enabled by PULSE allows for individualized athlete workload comparisons and adjustments, but some normative values can be helpful for providing a ballpark idea of how different drills and ball weights would affect an athlete’s workload from their program. Some guys tend to blow it out or may throw different Plyo Ball ® with varying intensities—which PULSE can provide feedback on for specific tailoring. Using either generic average or player specific info, you can build out a plan to reach specific goals, and then fine-tune this plan with adjustments based on the specific athlete’s daily feedback. A couple examples of these adjustments are:
PULSE will help you learn about and improve your athletes’ training habits. As you get started with PULSE and collect your own data, the reference ranges shown above can get you going in the right direction.

How PULSE Helped Georgia Gwinnett Win The NAIA World Series - Driveline Baseball,2021-08-03T01:33:08+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/how-pulse-helped-georgia-gwinnett-win-the-naia-world-series/,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of usage and data collection, PULSE was known as Motus. We will be referring to it as PULSE throughout this blog.
This post is the second in our series of blogs highlighting successful implementations of PULSE. You can check out the first blog here.
As an NAIA program, Georgia Gwinnett College doesn’t exactly get 5-star recruits clamoring to play for them. Instead, they get a lot of guys coming off of an injury or looking for a bounce-back. This past year alone, 5 of their pitchers were coming back from a significant arm injury — 4 out of 5 of them coming from their prior school.
The coaches at GGC knew that each pitcher needed personalized arm care programs based on where they were in their rehab or on-ramping. They couldn’t afford to guess when a guy would be ready for high intent, or when he should throw his bullpen in between outings.
Introducing PULSE into their program allowed them to bridge the gap between “feel” and real. No more guessing.
Two of their starters in particular, Adam McKillican and Hunter Dollander, religiously used PULSE to help map out their off- and in-season throwing plans and make sure they were ready to dominate on gameday.
On the backs of McKillican and Dollander, and the rest of the staff, the Grizzlies went on to win the 2021 NAIA World Series.
Adam transferred to GGC from the University of British Columbia in 2020 after their season was cancelled due to Covid. He had spent the entire 2019 season rehabbing from Tommy John and wasn’t ready to give up his season.
Coming from UBC, another proggressive program, Adam was already very familiar with PULSE and had used it to help guide his rehab program (check out how Driveline leverages PULSE in our rehab program here). GGC was able to step in and pick up right where he left off — even being able to utilize all of the data collected from his time at UBC.
Using Adam’s past data, GGC built out a tentative throwing program based on what he had done in the past. From there they would look back at his data after the session, and make adjustments to his schedule as needed. If he threw too much on a low-effort day before a high-effort bullpen day, the coaches would reschedule the bullpen to give him extra rest to make sure he was fresh.
It had been 20 months since Adam last pitched in a real game, but when the season arrived, he was ready to go.
Originally a starter, Adam was first used out of the bullpen in short stints to help him continue to build up arm strength and stamina, instead of being thrown straight into the fire. The coaches used the same strategy that they did in the pre-season in order to manage fatigue between outings, focusing solely on the workload outputs from PULSE rather than pitch counts.
Adam shoved out of the pen, accumulating 6 IP and surrendering 2 ER.
After 5 relief appearances, Adam was moved into the rotation. Following the same formula, the coaches took it easy with Adam, carefully managing his workload so as not to stress him too fast. Adam was able to work into a consistent schedule in between outings, and didn’t miss a start all year.
Adam was also able to stay fresh into the postseason, and through the conference tournament, regionals, and World Series, Adam threw 19.2 innings surrendering only 7 runs while racking up 19 K’s and sitting 94-95 mph, topping at 97 — a season best.
Hunter Dollander had been a reliable starter in his first 4 years at GGC. By the end of his 5th year, he established himself as the staff’s unquestioned ace.
The biggest contributor to Dollander’s ascent to ace status was increasing the velocity on his fastball. The first four years of his career, Hunter typically sat 88-90. After really bearing down in the off-season with a revamped throwing and longtoss program — all built using PULSE — he was able to bump his velocity up to 91-93, topping 95.
Using PULSE, Hunter built out a customized longtoss program using the app — similar to what Bryan Conger did at Tarleton State (see our first blog on the subject here)  to help him build arm strength and fitness in a smart manner.
Then came balancing his throwing program with his strength training program. Historically, Hunter struggled to balance these, but by introducing him to PULSE he gained ability to gameplan his throwing each day, and then plan the best days to lift according to his resulting throwing workload. No more making sacrifices to either his throwing program or his strength program.
The success of his work was immediately apparent not only with the jump in velocity, but with his ability to sustain velocity deep into games throughout the season. On the year he led the team in innings, wins, and strikeouts, and earned the NAIA World Series MVP award after pitching 15.1 innings with 14K’s and a 2.50 ERA.
Hunter leaves GGC as the all time leader in starts, wins, innings, and strikeouts, while helping the Grizzlies win two conference titles and make three NAIA World Series appearances.
—
For the coaches, PULSE gave them a way to effectively plan bullpens, high intent days, and off days leading into- and during the season. As they made their way into the playoffs, they saw other teams’ staffs dropping off, while their guys stayed strong.
For the players, PULSE enabled them to know they were as prepared to compete on gameday, as well as sustain that performance throughout the season.
Georgia Gwinnett College already had a good team — in the past four years they had won two conference titles and gone to the World Series three times. By implementing PULSE, they gained 2 legit starters to anchor their rotation and got themselves over the hump to win the NAIA World Series.

How to get started with PULSE - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-21T01:21:14+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/how-to-use-pulse/,"PULSE gives you the power to gain industry-leading insights into your throwing within minutes of receiving your sensor. What do you have to do to gather these insights?
Yes, it’s that easy.
Once your data is synced, you’ll be able to see how much throwing you’re actually doing each day – number of throws, intensity of your throws, etc. For some people, that alone is enough. This is your pitch counter on steroids.
Charge the sensor.
Put the sensor on before you throw.
Throw.
Sync the sensor.
Repeat.
That’s all.
1. Download the app
Once you have received your sensor, strap, and charging cable you’ll want to download the PULSE throw app from the Apple app store (use of PULSE is not currently supported on Android devices).
2. Create a PULSE account
Once you’ve downloaded the app, you’ll follow the on-screen instructions to create yourself a PULSE account. You’ll need to have the following information handy:
3. Connect your sensor
At this point, you’ll be asked if you’d like to connect to your PULSE sensor (you may also skip this step and do it later). Instructions for connecting your sensor can be found in the video linked here.
4. Put the sensor and strap on your arm
Place the strap on your throwing arm with the sensor located about two finger widths down your forearm from the bony part of your inside elbow. Here is a graphic to show how to place the sensor.
5. Do your throwing
If you don’t already have a throwing program, get started with an online program here.
6. Sync the data from the sensor
After you are done throwing for the day, reconnect and sync your sensor to upload data to the app and TRAQ. Here is how it will look on your phone:
Once the data is synced, you’ll be able to use the PULSE app to break down your throwing session.
Once your account is created, you’ll be brought to the main page of the PULSE app — the “Dashboard”.
The Dashboard is the central hub for your throwing data on a daily basis. On this page, you’ll find:
The second tab is the Dayplan tab, shown by the Driveline “D” logo. This is where you go to get your workout program for the day — either from TRAQ, or with the PULSE Program Builder.
Either link to an existing TRAQ account, or create a TRAQ account to get your program — totally free of charge.. Once you’ve connected your TRAQ account, you’ll be able to view and complete your program directly in the app.
The last tab within the PULSE app is the “Advanced” tab. This tab contains additional functionality for users that are interested, but they are not 100% necessary to get actionable info from PULSE.
The “Advanced” tab contains four features:
We have all this great info consolidated into the first tab of the app for you, but you might still be wondering – what do these numbers even mean?
1 Day Workload – Tells you how much you’ve thrown on a given day. It accounts for both how many throws you make and the intensity of each of those throws.
Max Recommended 1 Day Workload – A recommendation for the amount of throwing you are capable of performing on a given day. This is based upon your previous recorded throws, throwing fitness, and fatigue levels. These prescriptions can be altered based upon your specific throwing: pre-season v. in-season, days of throwing per week, game days, etc.
Arm Health Survey – A self-reported rating of how your arm is feeling on a daily basis. Recorded on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 meaning your arm is feeling amazing. This allows you to take the objective data from PULSE and pair it to what you’re experiencing on a daily basis.
Today’s Total Throws – The total number of throws you’ve made on a given day while wearing your PULSE sensor. This provides you information into the volume of throws you made.
Today’s High Effort Throws – The number of throws you’ve made on a given day that are above 70% of your five most stressful throws from the previous two weeks
For example, if your five most stressful throws are 60 Nm, all throws above 42 Nm would be considered “high effort”.
Today’s Average Torque – The average elbow valgus torque for all your throws in a given day. This provides you information into the intensity of the throws you made.
Throwing History – A bar graph displaying the amount of total throws and high effort throws you have made over the last 7 days. The orange bar represents all your throws for a given day, and the clear bar represents your high effort throws for a given day.
Today’s Throwing Data – A line plot showing Arm Stress, Arm Speed, and Arm Slot for every throw you made in a given day. You can edit throw tags and/or reassign throws to a different day here.
Add Workload – Life happens. Sometimes you forget your sensor or can’t charge it. When this happens, you’re able to add simulated workload to your profile so that you can stay on track. While this won’t be as good as having your actual throwing data, it’s a good enough solution. Similar to other throws, you can add tags to these and PULSE will apply updated normative torque values to the throws based upon the data you’ve collected with similar tags in the past.
PULSE is easy.
After Day 1, you’ll have insights into how much you threw, and how stressful those throws were. At its core, PULSE is a throw counter that accounts for the intensity of your throws – which already provides you more value than innings or pitch counts alone.
On ​​Day 2, and every day after that, the app will provide you with suggestions about how much throwing you should do that day based upon the data you’ve collected. There’s no guessing; PULSE is learning about YOUR throwing and adjusting to YOU to build you the best program possible.
Now after you’ve worn the sensor for a few days, you’ll be able to take away a few more insights, such as how your different throwing days compare to one another.
Whether you follow a throwing program from Driveline or your own, you’ll be able to see how your low effort versus high effort throwing sessions really stack up. How does your bullpen look compared to your long toss? The list goes on, but now we, and you, have the data to answer these questions.

Improving Your Mechanics with PULSE - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-15T00:51:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/improving-your-mechanics-with-pulse/,"Since its inception, PULSE has existed primarily as a workload tracker. The biomechanics metrics calculated by the sensor are used to drive workload measurements, as opposed to focusing on actual mechanical changes.
Elbow torque doesn’t give you very much insight into what is good or bad. As you throw harder, we typically see elbow torque increase. And who doesn’t want to throw harder? And arm slot can inform you of where your arm is at release, but throwing sidearm vs. over the top isn’t necessarily better. Currently, the mechanical insights taken directly from PULSE are valuable, but they are limited.
We’re aiming to change that by integrating a way to evaluate and improve your mechanics with PULSE.
Performing at the highest levels requires stressing the body; it generally requires more torque to throw harder. However, different athletes can throw the same speed but with different torques. We call this mechanical efficiency—how much velocity can an athlete create while minimizing the per-throw torque that is on their elbow.
Simply put, having good mechanics means you throw harder, and with less elbow torque than your peers.
Using a rudimentary measure of efficiency—throwing velocity divided by normalized elbow torque—we see a wide range of mechanical efficiencies. We also found mechanical efficiency to be related to improved arm health and reduced risk for injury. Improved arm health means fewer missed training days, fewer missed games, and more opportunities to improve as a player.
In an analysis of 800 athletes who assessed and trained at Driveline, the group of athletes who were injured, or became injured while training here, had a lower average mechanical efficiency than the group who didn’t have arm health related issues.
We also know that we can improve an athlete’s mechanics. In the last two years, 44% of the pitchers who have been at Driveline for 6 weeks or more have improved their mechanical efficiency.
Mechanical efficiency matters—it’s not only associated with throwing harder, but with arm health as well. Mechanical efficiency can also be improved—almost half of the pitchers at Driveline are able to improve in this department, many of whom also gained velocity.
By pairing the metrics already generated in PULSE and pairing it with ball velocity, you will be able to evaluate your mechanical efficiency.
As we found in our initial validation, PULSE already reliably measures elbow torque, all you need is a way to reliably measure throwing velocity—a radar gun, a Pocket Radar, a Rapsodo, all will do. By combining those two data points, we will be able to tell you whether your elbow torque is higher or lower than expected.
In the coming months we will be releasing a feature in PULSE that enables you to track your mechanical efficiency by tracking those two things.
Throw with a PULSE sensor + record fastball velocity → evaluate your mechanical efficiency
Even better, you’ll be able to automatically get this insight using our player management software, TRAQ. All you’ll need to do is throw with your PULSE sensor and one of the integrated velocity tracking devices (Pocket Radar, TrackMan, or Rapsodo), and you’ll automatically have the ability to monitor your mechanics.
Now it’s important to note that PULSE won’t be able to give you insight into exactly how your mechanics can be improved, it will only inform you that your mechanics are improving over time.
Think of it like a radar gun. You’ll know how hard you’re throwing, but the radar gun doesn’t tell you how to throw harder. Having insight is the first step. Know where you are so you can know if you’re improving.
Previously, the only way you could evaluate your mechanics was to fly out to Kent, WA and get assessed in our biomechanics lab. Now, we’re able to bring this insight to everyone who doesn’t have their own biomechanics lab, or who can’t fly out to Kent.
We’re bringing the biomechanics lab to your pocket—coming soon.

Return to Throwing Program,2015-09-30T14:05:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/using-pulse-to-guide-phases-of-throwing-rehab/,"The traditional model for phases of rehab that occur after Tommy John surgery look something like this:
This blog will focus on improvements that can be made in a return to throwing program.
ThiThis blog was updated on 6/3/2022 and was written by Dean Jackson and Kyle Lindley, edited by Michael O’Connell
Below is an example of what an Interval Throwing Program may look like.
It’s our opinion at Driveline Baseball that this type of program has three major flaws:
Let’s break them down:
Your first day throwing on this program involves two sets of “warm-up throws” and 50 total throws from 45 feet. If you split the difference on the warm-up throws and call it 15 throws each (10-20 per the document), then you are making 80 total throws on your first post-surgery throwing day!
The most common side effect of these types of programs involves soreness and setbacks due to the inability to overcome the volume of the program. This can create a vicious cycle of starting, stopping, and restarting a throwing program.
Our article detailing “pulldown” throws goes into a bit of detail, but players need to be tested at game-like intensities before they return to competition. We need to make sure that they are occurring at the appropriate time
Secondly, there is no monitoring outside of distance. Pitchers going out to 180 feet on this program do so at varying angles, velocities, and intent. Throwing at 40 mph or 60 mph at 60 feet should not be equal.
This program cannot be equally effective for the MLB pitcher who sits 95 MPH and the 17-year-old who sits 83 MPH. Other than different starting points, there are drastically different resources available to one over another.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also has its flaws as a measure of intensity.
Previous research has shown that the percentage of effort that a pitcher is trying to throw at does not correlate strongly with how hard the pitcher is throwing compared to their velocity peak (Slenker, Limpisvasti, et al. – Biomechanical comparison of the interval throwing program and baseball pitching: upper extremity loads in training and rehabilitation AJSM May 2014).
At 60% of perceived effort, pitchers were generating forces of 76% and ball speeds approaching 84% of maximum intensity.
Pitchers are really bad at estimating how much effort they are expending and consistently underestimate it. This should have profound implications for rehabilitation programs.
Programs are often written in a way that doesn’t account for the rest of a player’s life.
Some baseball players returning from surgery have a nice, smooth recovery process. Others do not. Some players’ bodies won’t let them progress for a few weeks. Other athletes feel incredible, and they feel ahead of schedule. It’s a rollercoaster to try and help a player along with  Physical Therapists and surgeons.
They are difficult to adjust in all areas because everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Because of this, there will often be some sort of setback due to throwing volume and intensity. After all, everyone will respond differently to a program. But we need to remember that other factors outside of the throwing program can also cause setbacks. Lack of sleep, varying nutrition, school load, or travel are a few reasons that can also cause setbacks.
The fact of the matter is tools exist today that can raise the standards of Tommy John rehab. We want a standardized approach but an individualized method.
The solution is to use technology to better track progress and make programs individualized. This means utilizing
Combined with subjective measures, these objective measures give us the best chance for the next revolution of rehab programs.
Using Pulse and a radar gun, we can monitor the following variables:
You can read more about the metrics on Pulse here.
We can use those to better supplement subjective measures by asking the athlete questions such as:
We can combine these to create the four main phases of our return to throwing program:
We can layer on more extensive monitoring with Pulse and Radar Gun inside these phases.
Arm Speed will be used as our primary monitoring tool until ~700 RPM Arm Speed. Reaching ~700 Arm Speed typically occurs after several weeks of throwing.
Once ~700 RPM arm speed is reached, we would switch to a combination of arm speed and throwing velocity. Arm speed and velocity would be used to continue progressing intensity through the remainder of the rehab. We choose ~700 RPM Arm Speed because that is approximately where Pulse Arm Speed starts to deviate from throwing velocity.
We would progress intensity using object data (arm speed and throwing velocity) and subjective data from that point on. Focusing on how he felt he was recovering, how his mechanics looked like his, and how his body responded well to the increased intensity.
The example below is from a return to throwing program with athlete Ryan Cloude. This example represents a sample of what can be done with a data-driven return to throwing program. The advice dispensed in this article would certainly not work for everyone for the reasons stated above. We know how weighted balls affect the torque on the arm and workload, the example program below only used baseballs.
Ryan Cloude is a 21-year-old collegiate pitcher. He has an interesting training history, having increased his pitching velocity from 83mph as a college freshman to topping at 95mph as a junior. In the middle of his junior season, he tore his UCL and required UCL reconstruction.
The goal of this phase was to build a throwing volume base at a low intensity. We start all our athletes off with a low threshold to set them up for increased intensity later.
Ryan threw 3x per week during this 4-week phase. We monitored Arm Speed with Pulse, gradually increasing from a one-session average of ~200 RPM and top 1/8th ~250 RPM to a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM.
Total throws per session increased from 25 to 90 from the beginning to the last day of the phase.
We built this phase of the throwing volume base established in Phase 1 by increasing the throwing intensity on Monday and Friday each week.
Once Ryan hit the ~700 RPM arm speed mark, we switched measuring intensity from Arm Speed to throwing velocity.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM to a one-session average of ~600 RPM and top 1/8th ~850 RPM. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 49.9 mph and top 1/8th 57.6 mph to a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th 76.0 mph.
Instead of throw counts, Ryan was given options between 60-90 throws on the higher intensity days. At the same time, lower intensity days progressed gradually from 90 to 120 throws. He did the max number of throws most days, except for three days where the daily notes had some variation of “another crazy conditioning at 6 am this morning, body felt dead. Stopped at 60 throws”—no arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
One week, the same intensity was repeated (instead of progressing it) because Ryan was exhausted from team conditioning and didn’t want to push it.
Return to throwing templates lack guidelines on how to make adjustments to the program. At times the adjustment doesn’t need to be because something went wrong with the throwing program. But other parts of a player’s life are still ongoing when rehabbing a throwing injury. Tracking these programs leaves a player and a coach in a much better place to make an appropriate adjustment.
The only difference between the schedule of this phase and the last is that instead of the weeks going HLH, HLH (higher intensity, low, higher, and repeat), they went HLH, LHL (higher intensity, low, repeat). This shifted Ryan from 4 higher intensity throwing days every two weeks to 3 high-intensity throwing days every two weeks.
There were two new additions in phase three. First, bullpens at lower intensity began in this phase. Second, we started to focus more on moving efficiently. We measure movement efficiency by throwing the prescribed velocity with the lowest possible arm speed.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~600 and top 1/8th of ~850 to a one-session average of ~700 and top 1/8th of ~ 925. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th of 76.0 mph to a one-session average of 69.6 mph and top 1/8th of 89.4 mph.
His volume options remained 60-90 on higher intensity days and 90-120 on lower intensity days. Ryan decided not to throw the max amount of throws on a given day: total body soreness from training with his team and getting kicked out of the gym as it was closing. No arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
Bullpen throwing velocity was dropped back to the high 70s, with two pens being thrown each week, and lower intensity days were added over a couple of weeks until Ryan was throwing five days a week.
Throwing velocity on main bullpen days gradually increased from a one-session average of 64.5 mph and top 1/8th of 77.4 mph to a one-session average of 74.2 and top 1/8th 90.9 mph.
We had phases that we wanted to progress through and a good idea how roughly how much we should progress over a certain period, but ultimately we let Ryan’s body decide if it was ready to progress or not.
If the prescribed intensity for a session wasn’t comfortable, we would not progress intensity in the next session (regardless of what the program template said). We would repeat the intensity (or reduce it) until it was comfortable. The main idea in the intensity prescribing process was “letting the door be opened” when Ryan’s body was ready and not trying to “kick the door down” and force a more intense stimulus on his arm before it was ready.
Other pitch types were added first to recovery days during this phase. Simply by throwing offspeed in flat ground or catch play/long toss work. Intensity and volume were gradually increased until Ryan was throwing at maximum intensity on the mound.
Volume options for total throws on each bullpen day gradually increased from 60-90 to 90-110, while volume options for lower intensity days stayed 90-120. Once Ryan’s velocity got back into the high 80’s a few bullpens turned into recovery days because he didn’t feel fully recovered.
The first live session versus hitters happened roughly 10.5 months post-op and went well enough that Ryan decided he was ready to face hitters in a game that counted for his team. The first outing versus hitters in a real game happened just before the 11-month post-op mark and resulted in 1IP 0H 0BB 3K.
After completing his return to play, Ryan reflected on the process as a whole:
“Having objective data to show my progress was massive for my mental state. On days where I wasn’t able to hit my goal or days where I felt I was so far away from being healthy, I’d be able to look back and see how much harder I was throwing and how much more arm speed I was able to handle.”
It’s widespread to hear athletes talk about the mental toll injuries took on them and how grueling the whole experience is. I believe collecting data to give athletes a good idea of where they are now, where they have been, and where they need to go can significantly improve how comfortable their experience with rehab ends up being.
Ryan also said:
“(I) loved having a progression based on how I was recovering and not a cookie-cutter program that’s the same for everyone.”
We’re attacking it via our integrated staff training methods, technology, and Driveline TRAQ – and results have never been better, both on the performance AND rehab sides.

PULSE Metric Updates - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-11T00:45:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/pulse-metric-updates/,"In our announcement of PULSE, we noted that we made updates to some of the metrics that are calculated by the sensor. Those changes were:
In this post, we’ll go into how we made the changes and what it means for you as a user.
In ASMI’s published paper comparing the biomechanics of throwing with different weighted balls, they found that as ball weight increased, elbow varus torque decreased.
We had similar findings in our own pre-print on the same subject. But when we looked at the effect of different ball weights on elbow torque in Motus, we found the opposite — that as ball weight increased, so did elbow torque.
To confirm the findings, we collected paired motion capture and Motus data across all different ball weights, from 3 oz. up to 2.2 lbs., to see what the actual difference was. Our lab confirmed the findings above — as ball weight increased, torque decreased.
In Motus, however, the torques increased.
To correct for this, we changed the physics engine in PULSE to calculate elbow torque more accurately when throwing weighted balls. Now when you throw with a non-competition ball weight tagged in live mode, elbow torque is appropriately measured.
More accurate elbow torque data means more accurate workload data.
Workload estimates are based on the torque measurement of each throw. If the torque measurement is overestimated, then the workload estimate is over-exaggerated. If workload is over-exaggerated for heavy balls, we might suggest an improper amount of workload in the following days.
For example, if a 6-foot, 200-pound pitcher threw 20 blue Plyo Ball ® (450g) and selected the ball weight, his one day workload would be one full unit higher than it should have been.
It’s important to note that the changes we made only matter if ball weights are selected for every throw you make.
This begs the question: what if you don’t ever modify the ball weight? Will your workloads and A:C Ratios be affected?
The answer is yes, but not meaningfully so.
By not tagging the ball weight, you will get an underestimated workload for throws with heavy balls, and an overestimated workload for throws with light balls.
In a throwing program that incorporates both heavy and light balls, however, the errors often cancel each other out.
When we ran our own internal tests on various throwing workouts, we found a ~6 percent error in workload of untagged vs. tagged sessions.
For somebody with who is on-ramped, a 6 percent increase or decrease would have less than a 0.01 increase or decrease in A:C Ratio.That’s nothing.
So is tagging ball weight going to result in more accurate workloads? Technically, yes. But the difference in doing so just isn’t worth it — especially if you’re a coach trying to implement PULSE with a team.
The juice isn’t worth the squeeze.
If you’re doing research with PULSE however, you can rest assured that the elbow torque metrics are lab accurate for weighted balls.
Shoulder rotation in Motus was a measure of maximum external rotation — or the amount of layback — that an athlete experienced during the throw.
When validating this metric against our motion capture lab, however, it just wasn’t valid or reliable. Across athletes (inter-subject), it was a reliable metric; we saw a correlation coefficient of 0.34.
Within athletes though (intra-subject), the correlation coefficient dropped to 0.03, indicating little to no reliability. Note the inter-subject black trendline in Figure 2 below.
We’re not going to lie to you. This metric isn’t accurate. It isn’t reliable. And we’re not going to feed you something in which we aren’t confident. Therefore, we’ve removed shoulder rotation from the app.
—-
At Driveline, we always aim to give you the most accurate and highest-leverage information. We’re not afraid to admit that something was wrong, and, by golly, we’re going to fix it. With these changes, we are taking a step in that direction.
While these updates were aimed at improving the global accuracy of the sensor and its workload measures, we have our sights set on the next improvement: evaluating your mechanics with PULSE.
Stay tuned.

How a DII Coach Used PULSE to Help Lead His Team Deep in the Playoffs - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-09T01:13:21+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/how-a-dii-coach-used-pulse-to-help-lead-his-team-deep-in-the-playoffs/,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of usage and data collection, PULSE was known as Motus. We will be referring to it as PULSE throughout this blog.
This blog will be the first post in a series that highlights successful implementations of PULSE in the past. The launch of PULSE is focused around making implementation easier — the same great insights from Motus, simplified.
The 2018 Tarleton State baseball program, like many Division II programs, had limited resources to spend on staff, recruiting, and/or technology. Unable to afford losing players to injury, Bryan Conger — then-head coach at Tarleton — knew he needed to do what he could to maximize performance while keeping injuries to a minimum. He found the perfect tool for the job in PULSE.
PULSE allowed him to build individualized throwing programs for all of his pitchers. It allowed him to optimize the pre-game warmup routines of his pitchers so they weren’t blowing themselves up before a game. It allowed him to manage the fatigue and readiness of his pitchers in-season so he knew who was fresh and who wasn’t
Most of all, it allowed the under-funded, out-gunned, and out-manned Tarleton State baseball team to make a deep run into the playoffs.
Conger knew that long toss would be the cornerstone of his players throwing programs. While the exact definition of long toss may still be left to personal interpretation, the one recurring theme is that it prepares the athlete to throw on the mound – either that same day or down the road.
But how far is too far? How much long toss is too much?
Longtoss prepares the arm to throw at game intensities through two primary methods:
Based on these principles, the ideal long toss program should expose the athlete to progressively higher throwing intensities that approach, or even slightly surpass, the stress levels experienced in a game. Throwing beyond that threshold though, would be overly stressful for the pitcher.
Using PULSE, Conger first set a baseline for each pitcher on the staff. Pitchers wore the sleeve during an outing throwing at 100%. This established the baseline for how much stress their elbows experience when pitching.
Conger then had each pitcher go through their long toss routine while wearing the sensor. Using the stress levels from PULSE, he was able to assess when a pitcher’s stress level went above their baseline. Some pitchers were limited to 200 feet, while others were allowed to long toss from any distance.
For example, two pitchers had the same in-game stress levels. When long tossing, one pitcher reached that stress level at 250 feet, while the other never surpassed his baseline stress level.
By optimizing his players’ long toss programs, Conger could be assured that his players wouldn’t be over-throwing in their routines and were preparing to compete in the way that best suits each of them.
The next problem Conger needed to solve was ensuring that his pitchers were actually completing their workouts as intended.
Most throwing programs have an undulating pattern to them – they alternate between lower intensity days and higher intensity days. The higher intensity days help pitchers build throwing fitness, while the lower intensity days allow them to recover while still getting some work in.
But there are a number of questions to consider when building programs for athletes:
Using PULSE on each athlete’s workouts, he was able to get insights that allowed him to evaluate if athletes were completing their programs as intended, as well as, compare the same workout between multiple athletes.
In one specific example, one pitcher was throwing too much on his “recovery” throwing days, which prohibited him from ever recovering — he was always worn out.
In another case, Athlete D’s high intensity days are consistently significantly higher workload than Athlete C. Rather than take away throwing from Athlete D on their high intensity day, assuming they still feel good and are performing well, Athlete D would simply take an extra recovery session in order to offset the increased workload on his high output days.
This information Conger had about his pitchers’ long toss routines and typical throwing workloads enabled him to make optimized programs for each pitcher to ensure they were ready to dominate.
The goal of the pre-season is to make sure your pitchers are ready to compete. For pitchers, this means getting exposed to game-intensities and building overall throwing fitness — or Chronic Workload.
Using the information Conger had learned about his players’ long toss routines and how they performed their throwing workouts, he built out programs that safely on-ramped each of his pitchers using an undulating program that ensured they were safely building throwing fitness over-time.
In season, the goal is to maximize the on-field production of your pitchers. This means ensuring that pitchers are not only conditioned to handle the stress of pitching in a game, but also not fatigued prior to competition. Doing this for 15+ arms with multiple games, bullpens, and practices is no small feat.
Throughout the duration of the season, Conger was able to use PULSE to make any necessary adjustments to ensure that his pitchers’ throwing fitness was maintained. This allowed Conger and his coaches to plan for the week to come but also make adjustments based on the previous week.
One example is when a starting pitcher had to come out of the game early – how do you adjust his midweek throwing? Altering midweek bullpen volume/intensity or adjusting midweek catch play and long toss are just a few of the ways you can use PULSE to ensure your arms stay prepared.
In a typical week, Conger would use what he called the “W-Program” to maintain a starter’s throwing workload. This consisted of higher volume mid-week work in order to keep a high Chronic Workload, while minimizing fatigue for game day
In the event of a shortened start during the season, there would be a much larger spike in Acute Workload in these throwing workloads if the same program is followed. How did Conger avoid this?
He had the starter throw two bullpens in order to accumulate slightly more throwing volume. One bullpen was at a relatively lower intensity while the other was similar to his normal mid-week pen. This ensured that the athlete’s overall throwing fitness stayed the same.
This same idea can be applied to many different scenarios – none more impactful than during the postseason. Being able to monitor pitcher’s workloads and make any adjustments along the way allowed for Conger to keep his best arms ready to go when it mattered most — a key factor for Tarleton’s deep run in the playoffs that year.
—
Using PULSE, Conger was able to keep his best arms healthy and fresh, priming a program with limited resources for a run in the playoffs.
In fact, Conger himself summed it up best:
“I was able to get more innings out of my starters, my best pitchers, without overtaxing them. They had better performance and more importantly, we avoided major arm injuries all season long, into the playoffs.”
With PULSE, we aim to bring these same insights to every program, while minimizing the need for extensive leg work to get a system stood up.

Introducing Pulse: Throwing Workload Management Made Easy - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-06T13:15:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/motus-is-now-pulse/,"In January 2020, we acquired Motus. From that announcement,
We bought Motus Global’s sensor business because we believed one truth:
This was a good but not perfect workload monitor for pitchers
Talking to customers, a big pain point was simply confusion: “what should I do with all this information and how does this system work?”
Driveline’s PULSE is workload management made much simpler.
It’s meant to answer a single question every day:
How much should I throw?
And we’ve built new tools for coaches to make managing athletes and making informed decisions easier. Right now we have hundreds of pitchers training with us – it’s not feasible for us to make our staff or athletes tag every single throw they make. Or calculate how many throws would result in a AC Ratio of 1.25 vs 1.45.
PULSE is built to help you work smarter – not make you do math problems.
In redesigning Motus to make PULSE, we focused on three main objectives:
So what’s new in Pulse?
Easy to Use
TRAQ Integration
Updated and New Metrics
Motus had a 3-day lock before you could actually start seeing any data. It was complicated and unclear how you could actually use A:C Ratio to drive your training. You had to do a lot of work to really get value out of the product.
Not anymore.
PULSE has 1 estimated workload for today — that’s your target throwing for today.
The home page has been simplified to only show you the the things you need to know to execute your throwing plan:
Everything else is hidden and removed. No more “Readiness” and no more 3-day lock.
We’re expanding the integration between TRAQ and PULSE, offering more utility in both tools.
In the PULSE app, link your TRAQ account (or create one!) to view and complete your throwing program for the day. Your throwing program and your workload data, all in one place.
In TRAQ, you’ll be able to view throw counts and workloads directly on the calendar to easily compare that data with your actual program. You’ll also have a Dashboard page that gives you an overview of all your throwing metrics from PULSE.
Through our expanded validation of the sensor, we found that elbow valgus torque from Motus didn’t match up with what we saw in our in-house biomechanics lab when looking at various weighted baseballs. We’ve made adjustments to the physics engine to correct for this.
More accurate stress data means more accurate workload data.
We also found that Shoulder Rotation was not a valid or reliable metric when comparing within athletes — that is, changes in Shoulder Rotation were valid across athletes, but not within an athlete.
Because of this, we’ve removed Shoulder Rotation from the app. It is still being calculated, but you won’t see it in the app moving forward.
Do you have good mechanics? Coming soon to PULSE, you’ll not only be able to manage throwing workload, but evaluate how efficiently you throw. More efficient mechanics means better arm health and less risk for injury.
By pairing PULSE metrics with throwing velocity, you’ll be able to get this insight. Just wear the sensor and record velocities in the app — even better you’ll be able to automatically do it by using velocity data in TRAQ.
This feature isn’t going live just yet – but keep an eye out for it in the coming months.
This isn’t even all of the features we’re deploying. Check out the Developer Notes for the full scoop.
Motus proved that workload tracking was an important component of any throwers training program. With PULSE, we’re excited to continue to build on that foundation and make this throwing workload tracker ours.

What are PULSEthrow and PULSEdash? - Driveline Baseball,2021-02-18T01:30:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/02/what-are-pulsethrow-and-pulsedash/,"If you’re looking for deeper insights into fatigue and workload, then you will come across PULSE, a sensor used by pros and amateurs alike for lab-quality biomechanical data, and integrates with TRAQ and Rapsodo Cloud.
PULSEthrow is a training platform for all ages which we use every day in-gym.
The lab-accurate PULSE sensor is worn in a compression sleeve or strap on the throwing arm and sits just below the Ulnar-Collateral-Ligament (UCL).
Each throw where a PULSE is worn—in practice or in games—captures peak valgus torque on the arm, which is accumulated into state-of-the-art workload measures designed to help you train at your peak.
Pair your PULSE and TRAQ accounts by emailing [email protected] with the email associated with your PULSE account.
Once linked, your data will update automatically, allowing you to view and complete workouts inside the PULSEthrow app—so you’ll never miss a throw.
PULSEthrow accumulates daily workload, acute workload (9-day average), chronic workload (28-day average), and acute:chronic ratio, which are all designed to increase your arm’s fitness in a safe manner.
A pitcher is primed for success when chronic workloads are built high enough to sustain in-game competition. A pitcher experiences fatigue when work is added too quickly. The acute:chronic ratio indicates the level of fatigue on the throwing arm.
With millions of throws captured, PULSEthrow has determined optimal throwing levels that go beyond age-old pitch counts and inning totals.
PULSEdash is a subscription web-service that interfaces with all of PULSE software modules and workload monitoring technologies.
It offers longitudinal graphing tools that break down workload and biomechanics in an effective and useful manner. Graph data over each day or month, or even for every move within a day.
PULSEdash allows advanced users to dig deeper into their data with graphing tools that plot data from every move within each day. It offers rich contextual data such as timestamps of each move in the day, primary activity tag, subtags, and more.
Through PULSEdash, you can run team-based and individual-based PDF reports. Choose from four varieties, including daily metric summary, longitudinal workload summary, gameday workload simulation, and team-based gameday workload simulation.
Gameday Mode allows users to run robust workload simulations and find their actual game-day workload limit. Gameday mode requires users to have gone through various interactive training sessions in the iOS mobile applications. In Baseball, users must complete a bullpen and long-toss session (Plyo Ball ® session optional) and set a primary session.
The total workload of these warm-up sessions are subtracted from a variety of daily workload allotments, that are then used to simulate fatigue measures such as acute:chronic ratio.
Gameday mode ultimately allows teams and individuals to better design game-day workouts and have a true understanding of how their training will affect their stamina and fatigue.
The Program Builder allows PULSEdash users to estimate and prescribe workloads for athletes using their own individually tracked throwing data. Create long-term training routines with projected workload metrics, and within-day training regimens based on player’s data.Athletes are given an objective workload goal for each workout and are able to see this within the PULSEthrow app.

PULSE Workload Blog: Pro Relief Pitcher - Driveline Baseball,2020-10-14T03:01:41+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/10/motus-workload-blog-pro-relief-pitcher/,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of usage and data collection, PULSE was known as Motus. We will be referring to it as PULSE throughout this blog.
Previously, we explored two different quarantine training scenarios for starting pitchers and the impact each might have on those pitchers’ abilities to return to in-game action (Part 1 and Part 2).
In this blog, we will look at the impact of workload on relief pitchers.
When evaluating a relief pitcher’s workload, it is important to account for the various ways they are utilized in games. A relief pitcher’s outing could span anywhere from a single inning to three or more. Fortunately, most pitchers at the major league level fall into only one of those categories.
Very rarely would you see your closer throwing 5+ innings in a game. For this blog, we will designate relief pitchers to one of the three following categories:
The line can be less clear between short and middle relief and between middle and long relief. Throughout the course of a season, pitchers will very likely make outings of multiple lengths. This can occur both out of necessity and also due to performance; a pitcher who has given up 5 runs in an inning will not stay in the game simply because “he usually throws 3 innings.”
Another factor we must take into consideration with relief pitchers is their pregame routine. Unlike starting pitchers, relief pitchers do not have the luxury of knowing which days they will throw in games. The amount of pregame throwing and work on the mound between outings will vary between each pitcher and likely between each outing. A pitcher who has not appeared in a game in ten days will be more likely to throw a bullpen before the game than the pitcher who has appeared in three of the last four games.
We can also reasonably assume that a reliever who throws four innings will have a different approach to the following day than the reliever who threw only one inning. For this reason, we will make a few assumptions about the throwing habits of our three different relievers. These workloads are based on averages for athletes we have had in-gym. Furthermore, these workloads, specifically Plyo Ball ® and long toss, have been modified per what we typically suggest for an in-season reliever. We still recommend using your own personal throwing workloads when possible.
The first scenario we will look at involve short relievers. This group typically faces five batters or fewer—think of your typical closer or setup man. It would be rare for these pitchers to have an extended appearance, outside of the playoffs. While it is more prevalent in college for closers to throw extended innings during a midweek game, that is not the case in professional baseball.
Below, we will look at the impact of various chronic workloads on a relief pitcher’s ability to make multiple appearances in a week (with a day or more off between each) and make consecutive appearances.
Starting with multiple appearances in a given week, we will look at the difference between one and two days between in-game outings based upon varying chronic workloads (Tables 2 and 3).
We see the biggest differences in the resulting ACRs during the second and third appearance, regardless of rest between outings. In this instance, the workloads on days that the pitcher did not throw in the game were equivalent to their pregame workload on days that they threw in the game, minus the bullpen and in-game workload (11.4 workload units). This was meant to mimic more closely the reality of life as a reliever, where you do not always know if you will throw or not and need to be ready every day. Changes in throwing workload based upon the previous day’s workload would result in slightly different ACRs; however, the current example still illustrates how greater chronic workload would allow for relievers to make more appearances within a given week.
The actual number of in-game pitches and innings is dependent on a variety of factors, such as the athlete’s individual pregame workload (including warming up in the bullpen), in-game outcomes, and the number of warm-up pitches between innings. That said, we can generally conclude that a higher chronic workload would allow a reliever to make multiple appearances within a given week.
The difference between one and two days of rest between outings is most pronounced following the second and third appearances. While an additional day of rest may not result in a large difference in in-game workload, there does appear to be a substantial difference between the resulting ACRs of these outings. An additional day between outings could also allow pitchers to modify their daily workload on days when they know they will not throw in the game. This could lead to an ability to withstand higher in-game workloads with only moderately higher chronic workloads.
It is very unlikely that a team would never use their short relievers for consecutive appearances. In the table below, we can see the difference in resultant ACR between various chronic workloads.
A pitcher with a chronic workload of 8 workload units could conceivably throw back-to-back days with a one-day workload of 20 workload units without their ACR rising above 1.3. While that same pitcher would not make three consecutive appearances, a pitcher with a higher chronic workload could.
Another factor to consider is the effect throwing more can have on a pitcher’s performance. In some instances, your closer may be extremely good at their current role, but asking them to throw 2-3+ innings is not worth it due to the decline in performance, even if they are physically prepared to do so. As Nate Silver has mentioned in the past, there is a decline in strikeout rate for relievers based upon appearance length.
Having your closer, who typically never faces the same batter twice in a given game, go through the order multiple times could very well result in less desirable outcomes. While this is certainly not a guarantee for every reliever, it is something that teams will very much consider when contemplating novel ways of utilizing their relievers.
Early in the season, teams are likely to be more risk-averse and avoid throwing their top arms on back-to-back days. As the season progresses, the ability to objectively assess various scenarios’ impact could prove extremely valuable.
The next group of relievers that we will look at is middle relievers. This group of pitchers typically faces anywhere from three to nine batters, depending upon the situation. Like the short relievers, we will look at the impact of various chronic workloads on a relief pitcher’s ability to make multiple appearances in a week (with a day or more off in between each) and make consecutive appearances.
When looking at middle relievers making multiple appearances within a week, it is very unlikely that they ever throw less than one inning. There are obviously outlier instances where this does not hold true, but in this instance, we will look only at appearances between one inning and three innings. When considering multiple appearances within one week, we will look at both one day and two days of rest between outings (as shown in Table 5 and 6).
Next, we will look at consecutive appearances for this same group of pitchers. In the previous examples, we have examined the resulting ACR after each of the first three appearances. When discussing this subset of pitchers, we would rarely see them throw on three consecutive days (at least during your average week of the season), and for that reason, the third appearance has been omitted. That said, in these examples, pitchers are performing three consecutive days of the same workload. During the season, a pitcher is likely to make varying appearances, and the corresponding one-day workloads are also likely variable. For this reason, it is not entirely out of the question that a reliever who is typically considered middle relief would be able to throw three consecutive days in a row.
The last group of relievers that we will look at is long relievers. These pitchers typically face eight or more batters—roughly two to three innings at a minimum. These pitchers could throw in several scenarios, most notably if a starter goes out of the game early. We also would expect some of these pitchers to make “spot starts” in some instances. It is highly unlikely we would see these pitchers throw on back-to-back days, and for that reason, we will look only at multiple appearances within a week. This will include one, two, and three days between outings at varying one-day workloads and varying chronic workloads.
The first scenario we will look at is one day of rest between outings. This is the least likely of the scenarios for this group of pitchers. Because we typically see these pitchers throw across three or more innings, it is typical for them to receive more than just a single day of rest. As you can see in Table 8, the corresponding ACRs increase as one-day workloads increase. This holds true for all three chronic workloads. We can also see that unless the pitcher has a shorter outing or has accrued a higher chronic workload, it is likely unwise they should throw on only one day of rest. Looking at this same group of pitchers after assuming an additional day of rest between outings, we see a few differences.
The majority of differences are seen at the highest chronic workload. Still, we also see that the additional day of rest would allow this pitcher to make a third shorter stint with a chronic workload of 12 workload units. While this additional day of rest has not allowed for a substantial increase in outings per week, it did result in a reduction of the change in workload from week-to-week. In other words, we see lower ACRs for the same one-day workloads.
The last scenario is likely the most common when discussing long relievers, as they can go three or more days between outings pretty regularly. In this instance, these pitchers would have three days in between outings. For this example, these pitchers followed their traditional pregame throwing workloads minus bullpens. In reality, we may expect to see some pitchers decrease their throwing volume the day after or even add an additional bullpen on the second or third day of not throwing in a game.
Fortunately, if you are a pitcher who is concerned that you may not have accrued the necessary workload to withstand the rigors of a season, there are still opportunities for you to make changes. Below is an example of how you could strategically suggest and program-specific one-day workloads to achieve the desired outcome. Within each of those suggested one-day workloads, you would also want to provide guidelines on the peak intensity for that given workout and the primary focus of that day (command work, competition, on-ramping, etc.).
It’s also worth noting that in these examples, we are exploring the “limits” of each of these groups; in reality, you will not be looking to push your athletes to increase their workloads consistently endlessly. Throughout the course of a season, pitchers will take on various roles, and objective workloads allow for adjustments to be made on the fly. Haven’t thrown in a game in almost a week? What is the ideal workload to allow you to get some work on the mound—maybe even facing hitters—while simultaneously staying fresh enough to perform when your name is called? These are the types of ways that coaches and players can leverage this information to their advantage.
Monitoring the workload of relievers could provide teams with greater insight into when a certain pitcher may need a reduction in pregame throwing volume (if possible), among other things, in order to be capable of throwing in-game without increased risk of injury.
Now, I understand that initially, pitchers might not be fond of the idea of a team monitoring their workloads. There are genuine concerns that teams could use this information to reduce in-game usage and in-game usage, and the resultant performances are obviously highly linked to a player’s contract. That said, monitoring of workload could certainly be mutually beneficial.
Teams have invested in their players and want those investments to be fruitful. Players want to play. Monitoring workloads could provide players value by increasing their in-game usage through modifications to their pregame and between outing routines. This also provides value to the players by reducing the number of times they compete in a fatigued state, which results in a higher risk of injury and reduced performance.
The team gains value through more efficient in-game usage of their top assets. This is not to say that instances like the playoffs will not still occur, where athletes and teams are simply more willing to accept greater risk. That said, this discussion only becomes possible with the use of technology that provides objective feedback regarding workloads, allowing teams and players to make more informed decisions.

Looking at the workload of a starting pitcher in Organization B, we see a pretty significant difference. First, this player does not throw Plyo Ball ® on a daily basis, and was also instructed to stay away from the mound entirely during this break.
If the season were to begin on that day, this athlete would have accrued a chronic workload of 11.5 workload units—only 61.5% the chronic workload of their counterpart in Organization A. After traveling for two days, their chronic workload is 10.3 if they do not throw at all. Just as we did with the pitcher from Organization A, we can also make a fair assumption about this athlete’s pregame throwing workloads using the program they followed during the break.
The estimated workload associated with each pregame activity for Player A is shown in the table above.
Using these pregame workloads, we can calculate the resulting in-game workload and ultimately the number of innings the prescribed workload corresponds to. The number of TotalPitches assumes that one inning is equal to 16.87 pitches, and is rounded to the nearest whole number. In this instance, I did not remove warmup pitches between innings from these workloads; therefore, the total estimated innings may be marginally higher. That said, all of the workloads were compared in the same manner so in comparing them to one another it is not a hindrance. Ideally, the actual workload associated with these warmup pitches would be accounted for based upon the individual athlete.
The table above shows the resulting acute to chronic workload ratios (ACR) for various one day workloads.
If this pitcher were to make a start that day while maintaining a similar workload to what they have been following (ACR = 1.0), they would be able to handle a 1DWL of 36 workload units (~4.8 innings). If they tried to maintain this same workload on a typical five man rotation, by their third start we see an elevated ACR (1.47). While it appears that this pitcher may be able to sustain a lesser in-game workload than typical, this does not take into account the fact that they have not thrown on the mound, faced batters, or had to sit down and get back up periodically throughout their throwing sessions as they would in the game. These are all factors that could be controlled for in training; however, we’ll operate under the assumption none of them were used in this case.
If the season were to start on Day 1, it would likely be unfeasible for this athlete to make an Opening Day start—even an abbreviated appearance. For that reason, we’ll focus on how we can build this athlete’s chronic workload back up before the season begins. Let’s set the minimum in this case to the pitcher’s ability to throw more than 7 estimated innings in a start without incurring an ACR greater than 1.3. In this case, that means they will need to handle a start day 1DWL of 48 workload units or greater.
Organization B gave their pitchers instructions to not throw on the mound during this period and await further instruction, so we will operate under the assumption that these athletes have not touched the mound yet at all.
The key objectives before the season begins will be:
A hypothetical buildup for this pitcher could look something like this:
The chart above shows estimated workloads for the given pitcher based upon various types of throwing sessions. Chronic Workload is also shown.
Over the course of 32 days, this pitcher would begin throwing on the mound regularly, this includes bullpens and throwing live to hitters, as well as progressively increase the total workload and frequency of such throwing. This is not a one-size fits all model to follow, but rather an example of how one could reverse engineer a throwing program using workload to reach a desired outcome.
During week one, this athlete would throw two bullpens with a one day workload of 26 workload units (~35 pitches) and one bullpen with a one day workload of 20 workload units (~20 pitches). In between each of the bullpen days, the athlete would have a workout similar to their 60-90 foot throwing day during the break. The first week would be capped by two off days to allow the athlete time to recover from the increased workload during the first week.
During week two, the athlete would throw ~35 pitches Live to hitters preceded by a 20 pitch pregame bullpen (1DWL = 30 workload units). This workout would be followed by a 60-90 foot throwing workout, 20 pitch bullpen, and another 60-90 foot throwing workout. The week would conclude with another Live outing; this time with a one day workload of 26 workload units (20 pitches to hitters and 20 pitches in the bullpen). Again, the week would conclude with two off days to allow the athlete time to recover from the increased workload during the week.
Week three would begin with a Live outing with a one day workload of 38 workload units (~60 pitches to hitters). Again, the first outing would be followed by two 60-90 foot throwing workouts and a 20 pitch bullpen. To finish the week, the pitcher would throw another ~35 pitches Live (1DWL = 30 workload units) and again take the next two days off from throwing.
Week four would be extremely similar to week three. The first Live outing would now be ~62 pitches, or a one day workload of 40 workload units. The next three days would again consist of two 60-90 foot throwing days and a 20 pitch bullpen. The second Live outing of the week would again be ~35 pitches (1DWL = 30 workload units). Following the second Live outing of the week, the athlete would only have one off day rather than two.
The last week of the pitcher’s buildup would again consist of two Live outings and a bullpen. The first Live outing would again be ~62 pitches (1DWL = 40 workload units) and be followed by two 60-90 feet throwing days and a 20 pitch bullpen. The week would conclude with a Live outing with a one day workload of 48 workload units (~80 pitches). Following an off day from throwing, this week’s throwing could be repeated minus the first Live outing. The result would be the pitcher making a start with a one day workload of 48 workload units every sixth day.
This entire process would take 32 days to accumulate enough throwing workload to handle a 1DWL of 48 workload units every sixth day without causing a spike in ACR greater than 1.3. Over that buildup, the chronic workload of this pitcher would go from 10.3 following the break to 17.7 workload units by Day 32. More importantly, we would be able to increase chronic workload by 72.23% without having a resulting ACR greater than 1.3 throughout the buildup.
We have built up the chronic workload of this pitcher to a point where we feel comfortable having them throw every sixth day  with a 1DWL of 48 workload units. Moving forward,  we have a few options to choose from in terms of continuing to increase this pitcher’s workload:
The typical in-season between start routine for a pitcher in Organization B we’ll assume as the following:
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Off Day 3: 60-90 ft Day 4: 20 pitch bullpen Day 5: 60-90 ft Day 6: Start Day
The first option is to continue with the standard five day rotation and gradually increase the workload until we reach a 1DWL of 56 workload units or an estimated 9 innings of in-game workload. In this case, following the first outing with a 1DWL of 48 workload units, this pitcher would be able to make a start with a 1DWL of 58 workload units the very next start. This pitcher would also be able to maintain that same workload every sixth day without their ACR ever going above 1.3.
The chart above shows estimated workloads for the given pitcher based upon various types of throwing sessions. Acute to Chronic Workload ratio (ACR) is also shown.
Maintaining this start day one day workload would result in a peak chronic workload value of 22 workload units following each start.
Another option is to increase the frequency with which the pitcher appears in a game in order to maximize those appearances over the adjusted length of the season. The typical between start routine for a pitcher in Organization B in a four man rotation would likely be:
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: 60-90 ft Day 3: 20 pitch bullpen Day 4: 60-90 ft Day 5: Start Day
In order to throw every fifth day as opposed to every sixth, the last Live outing of the buildup for this pitcher would need to be reduced to a one day workload of 40 workload units. The first start on less rest would also be capped at a one day workload of 42 workload units. The second start would progress to 46 workload units (~6.9 estimated innings) and every start after that could withstand a one day workload of 56 workload units or ~9 innings.
The chart above shows estimated workloads for the given pitcher based upon various types of throwing sessions. Acute to Chronic Workload ratio (ACR) is also shown.
While the five man rotation allows this pitcher to make their first start of 56 workload units earlier, the ability to make starts with a similar workload more frequently may be more valuable. Chronic workload in this case peaks at 23.6 workload units following each start with a 1DWL of 56 workload units every fifth day.
The five man rotation allows this pitcher to make their first start with a 1DWL of 56 workload units on day four following the last Live session of the buildup (Day 32 overall), compared to day 12 following the last Live session. Looking at the first 28 days of the season in totality, we can see the following workloads between the two rotations:
Number of Starts  + Corresponding 1DWLs
Number of Total Estimated Potential Innings
The benefits of a four-man rotation are only marginal during the first month of the season, but over the course of the first two months of the season we see this difference begin to become more significant:
Number of Starts (corresponding 1DWLs)
Number of Total Estimated Potential Innings
As you can see, there are multiple variables at play when addressing how long pitchers will need to be ready for the season following this break. A few of these include:
In the aforementioned scenarios, the workloads were very rigid and based upon averages. This is not a perfect roadmap for every pitcher’s approach to the season once it begins. Instead, this serves to show how monitoring and managing workloads could provide value to both teams and players alike – both in terms of potentially reducing risk of injury and also in increased performance.
There will be pitchers that manage to maintain their normal Spring Training routine throughout this entire period (similar to Org. A). There will also be players who haven’t been able to throw much at all due to reasons outside of their control (similar to or worse than Org. B). There is no blanket statement for the amount of time needed for these pitchers to properly build up once the season begins. In most cases, the more time the better.
In each individual athlete’s case, the best plan is to measure where you are, determine where you want to be and devise a plan accordingly. This plan should account for a given athlete’s individual throwing stress and between start routines. Pitchers are creatures of habit and quite frankly some guys may just not be comfortable deviating too far from the standard, whereas other pitchers may jump at the opportunity to make an additional handful of starts during this season. The ability to objectively measure each pitcher’s workloads will allow teams the opportunity to get more out of their arms during this time rather than less.
Given the shortened nature of the season, the question of how to best utilize your pitching staff gets a little blurry. Having your best arms throw more frequently is far and away more beneficial to the team. If you’re a player/team that wants to do that, you need to have a plan to progressively increase workload and monitor workloads throughout the season. These plans need to dynamic and combine feedback from the coaches/athletes with what the data is showing.
To think that we have perfectly figured out workload and the best way to utilize pitchers would be foolish. In many ways the current state of baseball, due to the circumstances of COVID, sucks. We all want to regain some normalcy in life and hopefully in time we will. There is a silver lining to this in regards to workload specifically. Teams and players are being forced into positions where they must begin to question the status quo – the answers to those questions is to be determined…

Starting Pitching Workloads: Part 1 - Driveline Baseball,2020-05-28T03:53:56+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/05/starting-pitching-workloads-part-1/,"There has been discussion recently about workload and the impact this time may have on an athlete’s health once seasons begin again.
More specifically within the context of baseball: Will there be an increased injury risk to pitchers as seasons begin again? If so, what are some possible solutions to mitigate these issues?
Using data presented by Ben Hansen (Modeling Elbow Torque by Throwing Distance) and data collected in-gym at Driveline via the MotusTHROW sensor, I was able to build a rough model of the impact of various training programs on throwing workload. While the main purpose of this blog is not an extensive review of each of these metrics, you may find more detailed descriptions of the metrics used in this article.
If you’ve never seen these metrics before, there are a few key takeaways. Every throw a pitcher makes can be given a value. The sums of these individual throws can be used to evaluate changes in the total workload an athlete experiences from throwing.
This is different from the traditional thought that pitch counts in a game are the best way to monitor workload. Traditional pitch counts fail to account for throws made before the game—both in long toss and the bullpen—as well as any throws made on days between outings in a game.
Did you throw any bullpens between starts? Do you play another position on your team? What intensity level were the throws you made? These are the types of questions we need to be asking when discussing workload management in the context of baseball.
Traditional thought seems to be that throwing more is inherently dangerous. That may be true—to an extent—as making more throws will result in more chances of injury, but at the same time will not necessarily increase the actual likelihood of injury. Chronic workload is a phrase used to describe an athlete’s throwing habits over longer periods of time, 28 days in this instance. Previous research has shown that greater chronic workloads can allow athletes to make more throws in the short term as well. These greater chronic workloads allowed athletes to handle larger acute workloads but also be more adaptable to changes in their acute chronic ratios. Typically the narrative surrounding workload is restriction/reduction in an effort to prevent injury; however, in most cases building up a larger base of chronic workload is critical to allowing an athlete to withstand the rigors of a full season.
In order to increase an athlete’s chronic workload we need their acute workload to be greater than their chronic workload (ACR > 1.0), but increasing this value too quickly may have adverse effects. Greater risk for injury in high-school-aged baseball players was found when their ACR was greater than 1.3. It is certainly worth noting that there is conflicting research and resulting opinions regarding the use of ACR as an indication of risk of injury. It is very unlikely that one metric alone will determine an athlete’s likelihood of injury. Nonetheless, monitoring the degree an athlete’s workload changes over time can still be valuable.
While most current throwing programs focus primarily on throw counts and throwing distance, we should be putting more emphasis on the workloads generated by each individual throw. I think most people would agree that having a pitcher throw 100 pitches on Day 1 is not the way to do things – just as you wouldn’t walk in the weight room after weeks/months off and attempt a 1RM. But what does a more objective, workload-driven buildup of chronic workload entail?
Below I will touch on two different throwing programs professional athletes may be following during this period of time, specifically starting pitchers. We will look at multiple scenarios for their return to in-game action and the effect those scenarios will have on their workload.
For the sake of this blog, we will assume that the throwing plan given out by organizations during this period mirrors one of the following two weekly options:
Org. A – Similar to a Spring Training schedule
Day 1: “Day Before” – Plyo Ball ® throws + Extension LT (similar to a Hybrid B)
Day 2: “Live/Simulated” – Similar to a Game Day (35 pitches)
Day 3: “Day After” – Light Catch out to 90 feet (similar to a Recovery Day)
Day 4: Off
Day 5: “Day Before” – Plyo Ball ® throws + Extension LT (similar to a Hybrid B)
Day 6: “Bullpen” –  Plyo Ball ® throws + Full LT + Bullpen (35 pitches)
Day 7: “Day After” – Light Catch out to 90 feet (similar to a Recovery Day)
Org. B – Await further information
Day 1: “60-90” – Catch Play out to 60-90 feet
Day 2: “120+” – Extension LT out to 120 feet
Day 3: Off
Day 4: “60-90” – Catch Play out to 60-90 feet
Day 5: “120+” – Extension LT out to 120 feet
Day 6: “60-90” – Catch Play out to 60-90 feet
Day 7: Off
We will cover options for dealing with a pitcher in organization A in this blog and the pitcher in organization B in the following blog.
Likely, most pitchers will land somewhere in between these two examples. These will serve as models of the impact of workload on pitchers’ abilities to return to in-game action while minimizing injury risk; however, each athlete should realistically be evaluated individually. A pitcher who is unable to throw much during this time will require more time than a pitcher on either of these example routines to prepare for the season during spring training, whereas a pitcher who is able to maintain a routine similar to in-season could conceivably be prepared sooner.
Another factor to consider is an individual pitcher’s routines—both on game day and between games. Do you throw Plyo Ball ®? If so, do you throw them every day or only some of the time? Are you a guy who prefers multiple bullpens to refine your arsenal? Would you be comfortable forgoing bullpens altogether and only throwing in games?
The chart above shows one day workload by workout during the break in the season.
We will start by looking at a pitcher in Organization A. This pitcher has been given instructions to follow a schedule pretty similar to Spring Training. Twice a week they throw roughly 35 pitches on the mound—one session Live to hitters if possible. They may miss a few training sessions, but we’ll assume they are able to follow the prescribed throwing plan each week for the most part.
The chart above shows us the estimated one day workload for each day, as well as the corresponding chronic workload. In this scenario, it is assumed the athlete has been repeating the same program each week and workloads have not changed over a period greater than 28 days. Therefore, chronic workload is represented as being a static number – 18.7 workload units in this case.
Another element to consider is travel. In this simulation I allotted the athlete two days off of throwing completely. Some guys may not have missed a single beat, while others may have needed upwards of a week to sort things out.
If the season were to begin that day, this athlete would have accrued 18.7 workload units of chronic workload (black line on top of the graph). Between athletes, this number is mostly arbitrary, as each athlete will require a different amount of chronic workload based upon their individual pregame routines (Plyo Ball ®, Long Toss, etc.) and between-outing routines (one bullpen, two bullpens, etc.). Greater amounts of chronic workload do allow for larger one day workloads and subsequently larger acute workloads without placing the athlete at a potentially greater risk of injury (>ACR). After taking into account the two days of travel to return to spring training, the athlete has 16.5 workload units of chronic workload. 16 workload units does not mean much until we apply some context to it.
Based on the athlete’s previous throwing program and the average number of pitches thrown per inning in MLB last year (16.87), we can break up daily workload into more specific pieces, as seen below:
The estimated workload associated with each pregame activity for Player A is shown in the table above.
So we know the allotted workload for this specific athlete’s pregame routine. What now? Using these pregame workloads, we can calculate the resulting in-game workload and ultimately the number of innings the prescribed workload corresponds to. I determined this number of innings by first determining the number of “total pitches” the athlete could theoretically make. In this case, their in-game workload was determined as 1DWL minus their pregame workload. From there I made the determination that every 4.80224 workload units were equivalent to 1 inning—based upon the game day workload charts above.
In this example, warm-up pitches were not separately accounted for. When evaluating an individual pitcher, I would highly recommend making these determinations more specific (warm-up v. in-game, pregame long toss, pregame bullpen, etc.). For the sake of this blog, a rough estimate should certainly suffice.
The matrix above shows the corresponding acute to chronic workload ratio (ACR) for various one day workloads. These are broken down in to three scenarios: no days off between starts, day off after start, and day off before start.
We can use the gameday workload chart above to evaluate the impact of various 1DWL on the number of in-game pitches. Using this chart, we can also see the resultant ACR for each of the first three starts.
If this pitcher was to make a start that day, while still maintaining a similar workload to what they have been following (ACR = 1.0), they would be prepared to have a 1DWL of 52 workload units (~6.7 innings). It is important to take into account the long term impacts of this as well. We need to account for the fact that this pitcher needs to be able to sustain that workload within a five-man rotation. Below are the standard between start routines we are basing these values off of. These workouts refer to the throwing program given out by the organization—this is why Day 5 is labeled “Day After” but is sometimes also the day before the start.
No Days Off
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Day After Day 3: Day Before Day 4: Bullpen Day 5: Day After Day 6: Start Day
Day Off After Start
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Off Day 3: Day Before Day 4: Bullpen Day 5: Day After Day 6: Start Day
Day Off Before Start
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Day After Day 3: Day Before Day 4: Bullpen Day 5: Off Day 6: Start Day
Looking at the gameday workload matrix again, we can see that while this pitcher could handle a slightly larger workload in the first start, the effect would be seen in the next two starts. A 1DWL of 52 workload units would give him an elevated ACR going into his third start (1.32). In other words, this pitcher could theoretically throw more innings on the first day, but this decision could set them back in terms of preparing to throw every sixth day.
An example of this outside of baseball would be to imagine you’ve been doing 3 sets of 8 reps of bench press for a few weeks. You could likely do 4-5 sets of 8 reps—but you are still going to be feeling it in a couple days when your normal 3 by 8 day comes back around.
For that reason we need to establish the highest workload this pitcher could withstand on Day 1 and also sustain every sixth day without their ACR rising above 1.3. While we mentioned previously that an ACR under 1.3 does not guarantee a change in injury risk, I would prefer to err on the side of caution following this period than being too aggressive. Using the gameday workload chart, we see that a 1DWL of 46 workload units would allow this athlete to make three consecutive starts of the same workload. Any higher 1DWL and this pitcher runs the risk of increasing their acute workload too quickly.
In this example, the athlete follows the schedule completely between each start, with consistent workloads for each workout type. Methods other than reducing the in-game workload are certainly available to mitigate these spikes in workload in real-life—giving a guy an extra day off, reducing the number of pitches in a bullpen, etc. The argument could certainly be made that these pregame workloads should be manipulated to maximize the in-game workload. In this case, we are assuming the athlete is set in stone with their pregame workload and we need to plan around that.
The chart above shows estimated workloads for the given pitcher based upon various types of throwing sessions. Acute to Chronic Workload ratio (ACR) is also shown.
If we continue to progress in-game workload in a fairly linear fashion, by the fourth start this pitcher is able to handle a 1DWL of 64 workload units (~9.2 innings) and sustain that every sixth day. The highest ACR reached during this span is 1.29, following the first start with a 1DWL of 64. This means that the average one-day workload for the nine most current days was 29% greater than the average one-day workload over the past 28 days.
In a simulation such as this, it is impossible to predict exactly how many innings a given pitcher could throw each day/outing, and for that reason we are left to estimate innings based upon the average number of pitches in an inning across MLB. In reality, 30 pitches may get three innings—or it might not get you through one. These are all nuances of the game that must be adjusted/accounted for on the fly and why I highly encourage pitchers to monitor their own individual workloads following many of the same principles outlined in this blog.
Looking at the chronic workload, we see that during this buildup in 1DWL from 46 to 64 workload units, this pitcher’s chronic workload has increased from 18.7 to 21.0 workload units (an increase of 12.3%) over the span of 21 days. If this given pitcher were to continue with their current throwing routine and have a 1DWL of 64 workload units on their start day every sixth day, their chronic workload would peak at 25.9 workload units following each start.
This means that over the course of the previous 28 days, their average 1DWL would have been equal to 25.9. As we discussed previously, chronic workload is a measure of arm “fitness”. If you are able to consistently throw 100 pitches in a game versus only being able to consistently throw 30 pitches in a game, it is a fair assumption that you have greater levels of throwing fitness.
This chronic workload is much higher than any previously modeled². The reason for this difference is that the pregame workloads for this athlete were likely much larger than those previously mentioned. This is primarily due to the focus on performing Plyo Ball ® throws and Long Toss prior to any throwing on the mound. Given this information, it is important to note that the addition of a Plyo Ball ® and Long Toss routine in a pitcher’s throwing program may serve to increase their chronic workload over time, or general arm fitness, in turn increasing their capacity to handle higher in-game workloads. More research is needed to make any concrete determinations about the limits of chronic workload within baseball.
In order to linearly progress gameday workload in the quickest manner, an off day was present the day before the start. It is very likely that some pitchers simply will not be fond of the idea of not throwing the day before their start. Variables such as this should be taken into consideration when suggesting alterations or prescriptions to workload for an athlete.
In the scenario above, we operated under the assumption that this athlete would follow the traditional five-man rotation. In that case, it would take this athlete 21 days to make their first start with a one-day workload of 64 workload units and 27 days to make their second start of 70 workload units on normal rest. Given the shortened nature of this season, I wanted to investigate other options teams might have to get more in-game use out of their best arms.
Could we see a team use a four-man rotation? A six-man rotation?
If teams were to adopt a four-man rotation, it appears reasonable to assume that the between start routine would be fairly similar to the original one, with the subtraction of the “Day Before” throwing workout. Similar to the original five-man rotation, we will also compare varying off days as part of the between-start routine:
No Days Off
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Day After Day 3: Bullpen Day 4: Day After Day 5: Start Day
Day Off After Start
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Off Day 3: Bullpen Day 4: Day After Day 5: Start Day
Day Off Before Start
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Day After Day 3: Bullpen Day 4: Off Day 5: Start Day
Again, we can develop a gameday workload matrix and evaluate the impact various 1DWLs would have on ACR following each of the athlete’s first three starts.
The table above shows the resulting acute to chronic workload ratios (ACR) for various one day workloads. Three different scenarios are represented: no days off, day after start off, and day before start off.
Just as in the original rotation, we see the athlete is able to have a 1DWL of 52 workload units and maintain an ACR of 1.0 following the first start. Due to the shortened rest between starts, this athlete is now only capable of having a 1DWL of 44 workload units without their ACR rising above 1.3 without the addition of an off day.
If we continue to progress in-game workload with an off day added before each start, by the fifth start this pitcher is able to handle a 1DWL of 56 workload units (~7.5 innings). By the seventh start, he is able to handle a 1DWL of 64 workload units (~9.2 innings) and sustain that workload every fifth day.
The highest ACR reached during this span is 1.29 following the third start. This means that the average one day workload for the nine most current days was 29% greater than the average one day workload over the past 28 days.
The chart above shows estimated workloads for the given pitcher based upon various types of throwing sessions. Acute to Chronic Workload ratio (ACR) is also shown.
In the process of increasing start day 1DWL from 50 to 64 workload units, this pitcher’s chronic workload has increased from 18.7 to 24.1 workload units (an increase of 28.9%). Once this pitcher is consistently making starts with a 1DWL of 64 workload units every fifth day, their chronic workload would peak at 26.1 workload units following each of their starts. The four-man rotation actually results in roughly the same chronic workload than the typical rotation.
While it may take slightly longer to be able to sustain higher workloads with one less day of rest, the long term effect in chronic workload appears to be negligible. There are obviously some caveats to this but if you are able to have your best pitcher throw more often without taking on additional risk of injury, why wouldn’t you?
Another option teams could pursue is the use of a six-man rotation. This would give each pitcher an additional day of rest between starts. The thought process here is that this allows for greater workload on the pitcher’s start day, with the downside of less frequent appearances. If teams were to go this route, a plausible between-start routine would almost assuredly include an off day:
Off Day After Start
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Off Day 3: Day After Day 4: Day Before Day 5: Bullpen Day 6: Day After Day 7: Start Day
Off Day Before Start
Day 1: Start Day Day 2: Off Day 3: Day After Day 4: Day Before Day 5: Bullpen Day 6: Day After Day 7: Start Day
The table above shows the resulting acute to chronic workload ratios (ACR) for various one day workloads. Two different scenarios are represented: day after start off and day before start off.
Looking again at the gameday workload matrix and resulting ACRs from the pitcher’s first three starts, we see the athlete is able to have a 1DWL of 54 workload units and maintain an ACR of 1.0 following the first start—just as in the other two scenarios. Due to the increased rest between starts, this athlete is now capable of having a 1DWL of 56 workload units without their ACR rising above 1.3 during the first three starts. A start day one day workload of 56 workload units equates to roughly 7.5 innings. As expected, this pitcher is now able to have higher one day workloads without seeing such large increases in ACR.
Just as in the previous scenarios, we need to progress this workload. If we place the off day before the start, this pitcher could theoretically handle a one day workload of 64 workload units and sustain it every seventh day immediately. Placing the off day directly after the start results in a more drawn out progression of workload.
The chart above shows estimated workloads for the given pitcher based upon various types of throwing sessions. Acute to Chronic Workload ratio (ACR) is also shown.
The chart above shows estimated workloads for the given pitcher based upon various types of throwing sessions. Acute to Chronic Workload ratio (ACR) is also shown.
In the process of increasing start day 1DWL from 56 to 64 workload units, this pitcher’s chronic workload has increased from 18.7 to 22.8 workload units (an increase of 21.9%). The chronic workload in this scenario is slightly lower than the previous scenarios despite reaching the same in-game workload. The trade off in this case is less frequent appearances in the game.
So, we have a rough idea of the amount of time necessary to build up this specific pitcher. We also know the subsequent workloads for each scenario and the estimated number of innings for each outing. With this information, we are able to compare the in-game usage between the three preceding scenarios during the first 31 days.
Number of Starts + Corresponding 1DWLs
Number of Total Estimated Potential Innings
The overall difference in estimated innings seems fairly small within the first 31 days in this example aside from the scenarios involving taking the day before the start off. If we were to extrapolate this out over a longer period of time, we would expect to see a larger difference between each of the groups. It is important to note as well that these are simply estimations of innings based upon the average in-game workload. Between outings, it is also unlikely that the same workloads would be achieved with the precision presented here. Implementing any strategy outside the norm would likely require someone to monitor and prescribe changes accordingly, while still allowing the athlete a good deal of autonomy. That said, if you were able to monitor and intensity, it does appear that there may be some benefit to having your top starters throw more frequently.
Having your best arms throw more frequently appears to be valuable, but how much value does it really bring to a team? According to Tony Wolfe of FanGraphs, the following teams would theoretically see the largest benefit in rotation WAR from a four-man rotation:
As Tony mentions in his blog post, each team would be impacted differently. If you have a deeper rotation then you stand to gain less from having your four best arms throw more frequently. However, if you are a team with a wide gap between the top and bottom of your rotation, then you likely need to sell out for having your best arms throw more often.
Tony notes that doubleheaders and injuries can further exacerbate issues in depth of a pitching staff when you are conceivably forced to throw your 7th or 8th best arm on a day. For some teams, that isn’t as much of an issue, but for others it’s the difference between making the playoffs or not during a shortened season.
In sum, if a pitcher were to come into the second iteration of spring training with a chronic workload of ~18 workload units as in this example, they would be prepared to throw in a game. The biggest limiting factor in terms of being completely ready for the season would likely be the frequency with which they have thrown high intensity or thrown to hitters. Given that they will likely have a few weeks to further prepare for the season and get accustomed to facing live hitters again, we can expect their initial workload capacity on opening day to be slightly higher.
In the event that pitchers are not prepared to throw 100+ pitches every sixth day by opening day, there is a question that each team will need to ask themselves: would you prefer to have your best arm throw more frequently and take the chance that they are able to stretch their pitch count across more innings or would you prefer to have your best arm prepared to throw more pitches within a single outing but run the risk that they get knocked out of the game early?
I personally believe that a shortened season should at least make teams consider forgoing the traditional five-man rotation in an attempt to have their best arms throw more frequently. The answer to that question is likely dependent upon each team (how deep is their pitching staff?) and each pitcher (what amount of chronic workload have they accrued? what is their preferred between-start routine?), but only time will tell.
Stay tuned for part 2

Do you have a citation for this line? I am just curious as I’d like to look at that research.
“Previous research has shown that greater chronic workloads can allow athletes to make more throws in the short term as well.”

Using PULSE to define throwing workload | Driveline Baseball,2020-04-24T02:45:59+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/04/what-is-throwing-workload/,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of usage and data collection, PULSE was known as Motus. We will be referring to it as PULSE throughout this blog.
The foundational concept behind the use of the PULSE sensor is “workload”—but what exactly does workload refer to?
In a general sense, workload describes the stress from each throw an athlete makes. So, does that mean that workload is just a measure of the number of throws an athlete makes in a given game? Not quite.
What typical in-game pitch counts fail to account for is the varying workloads between game days, as well as the variance in pregame workloads between athletes. For example, let’s evaluate two hypothetical athletes:
Player A
Long tosses out to 300 feet
Throws a 30 pitch pregame bullpen
Throws 85 pitches in the game
Player B
Long tosses out to 150 feet
Throws a 20 pitch pregame bullpen
Throws 85 pitches in the game
Using pitch counts, these athletes would be considered to have the same workload; however, we can see that they make a drastically different number of throws.
Okay, you may be thinking, so we should just track the total number of throws athletes make each day? Not quite.
Counting the total number of throws each day would certainly be better than just pitch counts in-game. Unfortunately, this method would still fail to account for the varying intensities between various throws. Is a throw at 100% intensity on the mound worth the same as a 50% intensity throw at the beginning of catch play?
With the use of the PULSEthrow sensor, we are able to measure the amount of valgus torque placed on the elbow with each throw. These values have also been validated against data generated at our in-house biomechanics lab at Driveline.
A throw with a stress value of 60 Nm will have a much different impact on a 16-year-old high school kid who is 6-foot and weighs 150 pounds, than on a 28-year-old professional pitcher who is 6-foot, 200 pounds. To take this into account, each throw is normalized for the given athlete’s height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).
Various loads have different impacts on our bodies over time. A squat of 400 pounds is going to leave me sorer than if I just squatted 200 pounds twice. In throwing, this would be equivalent to me throwing a ball with a peak elbow valgus torque of 100 Nm in comparison to two throws with a peak valgus torque of 50 Nm.
Research by NASA into the effect of exercise on bone loading and its impact on “Daily Load Stimulus” has shown us that the stimulus from exercise is not linear with the load placed upon the body. However, this research provided us with an exponential weight to apply to the load of each throw. Below is the resulting One Throw Workload formula.
The above formula tells us that to find the workload units for an individual throw we:
We are left with the workload units for each individual throw. Now let’s compare the workloads of two different throws again. We will assume this athlete is 6 feet tall (1.8288 meters) and weighs 200 pounds (90.7185 meters).
Whereas before the 100 Nm throw was considered to have simply two times the workload as the 50 Nm throw, the 100 Nm throw now equates to roughly 2.45 throws at 50 Nm.
Within the PULSEthrow app and PULSEdash, certain throws are tagged as “high effort” throws. This designation is not meant to be good or bad but is simply used to provide further insight into your throwing habits each day. To begin, the elbow valgus torque from all throws in the past two weeks that were not simulated, weighted balls, or outliers are summed. In other words, the number of throws with a 5-ounce baseball were measured in real-time over the past two weeks.
IF there are greater than 50 throws remaining:
IF there are less than 50 throws remaining:
As we touched on previously, each throw in a given day is not performed at the same intensity. An athlete’s first throw of the day playing catch is likely not going to be as stressful as their first pitch in the game. To find the workload units within each day, we find the sum total of all one throw workloads within that given day. We title this metric One Day Workload.
The above formula tells us that to find the workload units for a given day we:
The resulting one day workload gives us better insight into how each day’s throwing is impacting the athlete. While making more throws in a given day will accumulate workload within that day, throw count is not necessarily indicative of workload. Different throw counts can result in the same one day workload and the same one day workload can be reached with a number of different throw counts.
Why is one day workload of importance? By calculating the workload units from a given day, we can also evaluate trends in an athlete’s workload over time—both recently and over longer periods of time. With PULSEthrow, we are able to find each athlete’s Acute Workload and Chronic Workload. Acute workload refers to the average one day workload for a given athlete over the previous nine days, whereas chronic workload refers to the average one day workload for the last 28 days.
The condition of your arm is not simply impacted by the workload from that given day but is also impacted by the previous days you’ve thrown.  If we simply took the average for the previous nine days, each day within those nine days would hold the same weight. Realistically, throwing today is going to have a larger impact on your throwing tomorrow than your throwing from eight days ago. To factor for this, PULSEthrow uses a weighted moving average for each one day workload when calculating an athlete’s acute workload. This is accomplished by the use of “Acute Kernels,” in which the workload from the most recent day is multiplied by 1.3, and workloads from previous days are multiplied by lower values, such that eight days prior is multiplied by 0.7.
Once we have determined the weight of each one day workload and found the corresponding values, we must then sum these values. After summing these values, the total must be divided by a number of days, “N,” to find the weighted average one day workload. Typically, N would equal nine since that is the number of days we are evaluating; however, during the first two weeks of assessing acute workload, we use a “dynamic divisor” in its place to make the values more usable. The dynamic divisor, in this case, ranges from three to nine days. On the first day N=3, and on each subsequent day, N increases by one until reaching 9 on day 7 where it will remain. This results in the following equation for acute workload during the first two weeks:
The above equation tells us that to find the workload units for acute workload we:
We are left with the value for the weighted average workload units for the past nine days, acute workload within the first two weeks for an athlete. After the first two weeks, we are able to use a static divisor, 9. The corresponding equation is used for acute workload following the first two weeks:
The above equation mirrors the equation used during the first two weeks for Steps 1, 2, and 3. Once the sum of the weighted one day workloads is found, it is divided by 9 each day, rather than ranging from 3 to 9.
Acute workload can be used to tell us about an athlete’s throwing habits in the short term. When used in conjunction with chronic workload, these measures can help us to evaluate how similar or different these workloads are over time.
Before we can compare acute and chronic workloads, we must first calculate chronic workload. Previously we mentioned that chronic workload describes an athlete’s past 28 days of throwing. Unlike acute workload, chronic workload is not a weighted average but a rolling average of one day workloads over the past 28 days. Similar to acute workload, we initially use a dynamic divisor for chronic workload to make the values more usable. The dynamic divisor for chronic workload ranges from 5 to 28 days and is used for the first 24 days before the use of a static chronic divisor. The following equation is used for chronic workload during the first 24 days:
The above equation tells us that to find the workload units for chronic workload we:
…
…
The result is the value for chronic workload. Past the first 24 days, we are able to use a static chronic divisor, 28. The corresponding equation is used for chronic workload moving forward…
The above equation mirrors the equation used during the first two weeks for Steps 1 and 2. Once the sum of the one day workloads is found, it is divided by 28 each day, rather than ranging from 5 to 28.
Chronic workload tells us about an athlete’s throwing habits in the long term and can be considered a measure of general throwing fitness. Again, when used in conjunction with acute workload, these measures can help us to evaluate how similar or different these workloads are over time. Higher levels of chronic workload have been associated with decreased risk of injury and also allow for greater amounts of acute and one day workload without increasing acute to chronic ratio—which we will discuss next.
The last metric we will discuss is acute to chronic workload ratio. Acute to chronic ratio tells us how similar an athlete’s workload over the previous nine days is in comparison to their workload over the previous 28 days. This ratio is found using the following equation:
An acute to chronic ratio of 1.0 would mean that the athlete’s average one day workload during those two spans was identical. An acute to chronic ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the athlete’s current throwing workload is higher than it has been previously. Lastly, an acute to chronic ratio less than 1.0 indicates the athlete’s throwing workload is less than it has been previously.
To increase an athlete’s chronic workload, the athlete must have an acute to chronic ratio greater than 1. Previous research has shown us that once acute to chronic ratios get too high athletes tend to show an increased risk of injury. The result of this research was that acute to chronic ratios in baseball athletes higher than 1.3 resulted in their being more likely to sustain an upper-body injury.
An acute to chronic ratio of 1.3 would indicate a 30% increase in the average one day workload over the most recent nine days in comparison to the previous 28 days. This is important to note, as athletes, pitchers especially, build up throwing volume and intensity in preparation for their seasons.
While we must have an acute to chronic ratio higher than 1 in order to increase an athlete’s chronic workload, we must not increase this workload too quickly or else risk significantly increasing their risk for injury. This is not to say that maintaining an acute to chronic ratio under 1.3 reduces the risk of injury completely, but it does seem to help.
On the flip side, having an acute to chronic ratio that is too low can also be detrimental. The suggested range for acute to chronic ratio is therefore 0.7 to 1.3.
By using PULSEthrow and PULSEdash, we are able to better understand the impact various throwing workloads have on baseball athletes. We can objectively measure the amount of elbow valgus torque generated during each throw and then assign the throw a value based upon the athlete’s height and weight. From this one throw workload value, we can determine one day workloads for various throw counts and intensities.
These one day workload values are then transformed into acute and chronic workloads that tell us about an athlete’s throwing workload in both the short term and long term. These acute and chronic workloads allow us to determine the acute to chronic workload ratio for the given athlete—which has been shown to signal an increase in the risk of potential injury.
Traditional thought may be that workload is measured as a means to reduce the amount a pitcher throws. In reality, if monitored and progressed appropriately, objectively measuring pitchers’ workloads could allow us to have pitchers handle larger workloads more safely.

Pulse Throw: What do these numbers mean? | Driveline Baseball,2020-04-20T23:47:17+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/04/motus-throw-what-do-these-numbers-mean/,"Baseball has now become rich with technology, which means data is abundant. However, the data isn’t valuable unless you understand what it’s describing. The Pulse sensor is a tool that provides a lot of data and could be overwhelming if it is not fully understood.
The purpose of this piece is to discuss some updates we made to metric definitions in the Pulse Throw iOS application and to clear up any muddy waters around the Pulse outputs so that you can put this useful data to work.
Let’s walk through each of the live data metrics.
Elbow Torque: Total estimated torque on the medial aspect of the elbow
Picture from Buffi et al. 2014
Arm Slot: The angle between the forearm and the ground at ball release
Arm Speed: The peak total rotational speed of the forearm during the throw
Shoulder Rotation: The angle between the forearm and the ground at maximum external rotation of the shoulder—represents maximum external rotation
NOTE: Shoulder Rotation is now deprecated and not shown in the PULSE Throw app. See this post for more details.
Now that we know what each of these metrics represents, they can each be used in different ways to aid pitching training and development:
Arm Stress
Arm Slot
Arm Speed
Shoulder Rotation
Monitor intent
Evaluate throwing efficiency
Pitch design
Monitor fatigue
Monitor intent
Evaluate readiness
N/A (Deprecated)
As we can see, there are many training and assessment applications for Pulse when you have the proper knowledge of each metric.
This includes both long-term monitoring of training progress and short-term evaluation, such as monitoring intent of a low-intensity bullpen session with Arm Speed or designing a pitch by adjusting Arm Slot at release. A good example of how the Arm Stress metric has been used is monitoring workload to better understand long-term throwing fitness.
An individual’s daily workload can be calculated using the sum of all elbow torque values throughout a day. This is provided in the Pulse DASH and Pulse Throw to estimate readiness for throwing workouts by comparing long-term daily workloads to recent daily workloads. This is an entire additional application that can open many doors to properly on-ramping and managing pitchers’ overall workloads. More importantly, it is a good example of how these metrics can be used for longer-term player development initiatives.
With a mobile and reliable way to evaluate throwing characteristics, there are endless opportunities to grow player development programs. A big obstacle for objectively changing mechanics has been the ability to measure them. With Pulse Throw, we can start tackling this obstacle piece by piece with affordable access to the measurement of athletes’ throwing characteristics.

Motus Global Acquisition: Vision and Strategic Roadmap - Driveline Baseball,2020-02-11T22:00:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/02/motus-global-acquisition/,"We Acquired Motus Global!
As announced Monday, Driveline Baseball has acquired the sport sensor assets of Motus Global–specifically all sensor code and inventory, all trademarks and patents, all databases, and all outstanding contracts.
This begins a new era in Driveline’s history. One that will be marked by:
So What’s the Plan?
We bought Motus Global’s sensor business because we believed one truth:
This was a good but not perfect workload monitor for pitchers.
Nothing like it exists on the market.
What the team at Motus Global did when they built this technology is remarkable–it is affordable, it is directly applicable to an athlete’s routine, and it’s accurate enough.
As its next owner, we believe we can add value to the baseball community by validating Motus Global sensor data against our biomechanics lab, finding new ways to deliver value, and building features that improve baseball performance.
If you’re buying a Motus Global sensor from Driveline, you’re inviting us to be a meaningful part of your practice and gameday routines.
We owe it to you to be as accurate as possible. We previously validated the sensor against our biomechanics lab, concluding:
“Excepting elbow extension velocity, all metrics from the MotusBASEBALL unit showed significant correlations to their corresponding metrics from motion capture and while some magnitudes differ substantially and therefore fall short in validity, the link between the metrics is strong enough to indicate reliable casual use. Further research should be done to further investigate the validity and reliability of the arm speed metric.”
Driveline is going to deepen that validation work, investigating ways to make the sensor more accurate against our lab results.
Specifically, we’ll be undertaking these projects within the first 6 months:
Both of these projects not only improve the global accuracy of throwing stress and related metrics but will also improve the accuracy of the A:C Ratio calculation.
If we believe that acute/chronic workload ratios can help coaches and athletes build throwing volume successfully while reducing the risk of injury, then we owe it to the baseball community to make that technology as accessible as possible.
To that end, we will have a new subscription model with a lower-priced option and some new features coming this fall:
But that’s not the only feature set we are looking to improve.
One of the contributing factors to Driveline Baseball not being able to fully adopt the Motus technology stack internally was….lack of washing machines on site. We just didn’t feel like there was a work/reward trade-off to hand-washing 150+ sleeves every day (or creating a system internally that relied on athlete’s owning and washing their own).
Sleeves as a form factor are fine. But we’d like to make sure we’ve exhausted all of our options to find the best way to ensure the sensor is firmly in the right place for an entire day of throwing.
We have some ideas–we’ll be testing them.
With our ability to correlate sensor data directly to our lab in Kent, WA (and do so with a growing sample size of athletes), eventually Motus Global sensors can become an affordable, portable Driveline lab-in-a-box.
Working with other technology partners and teams, we can ultimately create analysis backed by accurate technology and sound science at an affordable price.
Combined with our efforts to find new ways to wear the sensor and new experiences that do not require use of the sensor every day, we believe Driveline + Motus Global can help pitchers at all levels get more out of their careers.
The Driveline/Motus Experience in 2021
A pitcher logs into their phone and sees that it’s Assessment Week.
For the next 3 days, they complete a variety of structured throwing plans with a prescribed number of throws, weights of ball, distances and effort levels. Based on that data, they get a score for where they stand relative to their peers.
Based on your drill performance, Driveline can recommend suggested drills for your athlete to improve.
For the next 28 days, they complete their work in Driveline TRAQ or the Motus DASH. They don’t wear the sensor and just mark their work for that day complete. Their A:C Ratio adjusts based on what we know from their Assessment.
The coach and the pitcher are alerted if work isn’t completed–or if A:C Ratios are deviating significantly.
If you need a coach, we have some available to evaluate your throwing program, data and video. If you don’t, keep doing your thing.
We have some work to get there…but we’re excited to start digging in.

Motus Advances Workload Models with Fatigue Units - Driveline Baseball,2019-09-27T16:34:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/09/motus-advances-workload-models-with-fatigue-units/,"What if pre-game warmups were the cause of the Tommy John epidemic? And not just because of the un-tracked volume of pre-game work (which is much too large), but what if it was because of the rate at which warmup throws occur? The average time between pitches in a baseball game is 15 seconds, but the average time between throws during longtoss and bullpen warmups is about 3.5 seconds. Muscles need time to recover from fatigue, so surely this time gap must factor into a pitcher’s physiological workload.
To capture this phenomenom, motusDASH web-app users now have access to Fatigue Units computed over each second of every throwing day. While Motus’ modified 9-day ACR and Chronic workload measures help identify fatigue over the scale of weeks and months, Fatigue Units are targeted to identify fatigue on the scale of seconds and minutes within a single day. Powered by peak torque of each throw, Fatigue Units accumulate during periods of high throwing frequency and regenerate during periods of rest.
Fatigue Units were first developed in 2014 by Dr. Michael Sonne (pronounced “Sawn”) based on publicly available pitchFX data. The models created by Sonne investigated the reduction in various arm muscles’ ability to generate force when exposed to repetitive activity. His early work was inspired by the implementation of the “pitch clock” (link), and showed how making pitchers throw sooner with less time between pitches was exposing pitchers to increased muscle fatigue and ultimately injury risk.
When it comes to injuries in pitchers, fatigue is the leading risk factor. First quantified via ASMI’s 10-year youth baseball study, researchers found that self-reported “throwing while fatigued” resulted in a 36x increase in injury risk [1].The researchers also quantified seasonal fatigue effects, finding that throwing over 100 innings in an calendar year resulting in a 3.5x increase in injury risk. On the scale of weeks and months, research from Dr. Sameer Mehta found that throwing while the acute:chronic ratio is greater than 1.3 resulted in a 15.2x increase in injury risk [2]. Fatigue can manifest in even shorter time-frames.
Motus and Sonne collaborated together with some of the brightest minds in baseball to bring Fatigue Units into further action, including Dr. Tim Gabbett, Dr. Chris Camp, Bryan Conger, and Zach Dechant. The full white-paper behind the science of Motus’ modified Fatigue Units can be found here (link) and recent coverage of the application of fatigue and workload management can be found at IEEE Spectrum, here (link).”Our fatigue model was originally developed to evaluate the effects of forces, cycle times, and postures on muscle fatigue accumulation during repetitive occupational tasks. If a worker is asked to perform the same number of tasks, at the same intensity, but you take away their rest time – their fatigue levels go up. I adapted this fatigue model when I first heard about the concept of the MLB including pitch clocks to reduce the time between pitches”, said Sonne.
“There’s some mathematical modelling that we’ve performed to get these numbers, but at the end of the day it’s really just common sense – recovery time is key to understanding fatigue. Fatigue Units were created to be a better representation of what is happening physiologically in pitchers compared to traditional metrics like pitch counts or innings pitched, and our initial research shows it is a much better indicator of high workloads. Combining this research with the MOTUS technology is the absolute best way to take these findings to coaches and players across the world, and develop better strategies to improve performance while limiting risk of injury”, he added.
Below in Figure 1 is an example of Fatigue Units (FU’s) computed for a starting pitcher who completed six innings of work while wearing the motusTHROW. Each throw increases the current level of FU’s based on the valgus torque of the throw. If a pitcher rests 3 minutes between throws, the FU’s decay back to zero; however, if a pitcher makes consecutive throws in a short time interval (3-20 seconds apart), the FU’s build on each other and the fatigue decay rate starts over. The longer the gap of time between throws, the more the FU’s decay. Motus provides both the total accumulated FU’s on the day and the peak FU’s on the day.
In this example, the pitcher has 7 local peaks of FU’s: his warmup routine (longtoss and bullpen) and 6 distinct innings. Notice how during the warmup the rapid rate of throwing and large volume of throwing results in a peak FU that is almost twice that of any inning’s peak. Furthermore, the lack of rest and rapid transition from longtoss to bullpen throwing compounds the buildup of FU’s well into the fast-paced pregame bullpen session. This is a common trend in the nearly 20,000 game datasets that Motus has recorded since the launch of the sleeve in 2015. Pitchers tend to follow this traditional strategy of warmups, which result in large FU peaks prior to competitive throwing.
However, this exposure of peak FU’s in pregame warmups is modifiable and avoidable. A professional pitcher competing in the Arizona Fall League and active Motus/WASP client (who asked for anonymity), self-modified his approach to warmups and lowered his peak pregame FU’s by almost 35%. “I tried to take a breath and count to five between each warmup throw and it really slowed me down. I took my time and I wasn’t exhausted at all. It felt really efficient”, he said.
This pitcher’s approach is a sign of a newer-age of pitchers coming that have taken data into their own hands. Outside of workload management via Motus’ WASP to build chronic workload and minimize acute:chronic ratios via personalized projections, his ability to lower Fatigue Units on game-days created more capacity for competitive in-game throwing in the Arizona Fall League.
To access Fatigue Units on Motus data, users must be subscribed to the advanced analytics platform, motusDASH (https://motusthrow.motusdash.com). On each day of throwing, Fatigue Units can be viewed under the Trends/Interday Data module, after toggling the “Fatigue” selector. The interactive Fatigue Unit module allows users to select batches of time to view throwing volume densities and totals, inspect local FU’s over time, view peak and accumulated FU’s on each day, and allows users to export .csv’s of FU’s over each second in the day for their own research.
The tools available with the launch of Fatigue Units is yet another step forward in transforming Motus’ wearable technology data into physiologically relevant measures. As Motus continues to research and mine Fatigue Unit data as it relates to injury and performance, additional features will be developed to give even more actionable insights to users.
While MLB in-game rules allow in-game wear, those same rules prevent users from downloading data during the game. In the near future and with rule-changes, Motus envisions the ability to have Fatigue Units available in-game to allow players and staff to better time mound visits and ultimately have better insights into when daily limits are reached.

Pitching Velocity and its Effect on UCL Stress Using the PULSE Sleeve - Driveline Baseball,2016-07-28T06:46:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/07/pitching-velocity-and-its-effect-on-ucl-stress-using-pulse/,"This is a guest post by Dr. Mike Sonne that was republished from his website. Dr. Sonne has a PhD in biomechanics from McMaster University in Hamilton, where he studied muscle fatigue and how it influences performance.
The dudes over at Driveline gave us scientists the best present we could ever hope for – data.
Up here in Toronto, you can’t go five minutes into a Blue Jays conversation without hearing about the dilemma the team faces regarding Aaron Sanchez. The young ace Sanchez, is without a doubt, the best pitcher on the team, and arguably one of the top five starting pitchers in the American League this season. Last year the Jays spent a ton of prospect capital to go out and get an ace in the trade market – this year, they’re talking about moving the Ace they already have into the bullpen.
I’m not convinced that this is going to work to reduce stress on Aaron’s arm. Will he throw fewer innings? For sure – but as I’ve tried to demonstrate – fatigue accumulation in the arm doesn’t necessarily depend on the number of innings you pitch, but more on the number of pitches you throw in an inning. Sanchez has been known to dial up his fastball to 100mph out of the bullpen, and this left me asking the question – despite limiting his innings, is Aaron Sanchez going to be exposing his arm to more stress by throwing out of the pen? Let’s look at the driveline data to see if we can figure this out.
In the Driveline study, five pitchers threw 20 pitches each. Some had Powerguard on, some didn’t – but for the sake of this study, I’m going to ignore that factor (they didn’t find there was a reduction in stress, anyway). First, I looked at the relationship between stress and the other variables that came out of the PULSEthrow Sensor. There was an R2 of 0.84 between pitch velocity and elbow stress – that means, 84% of the stress on the UCL can be accounted for by the velocity of the pitch. If someone throws harder – they’re going to have more elbow torque, and greater UCL stress. The rest of the variables – they get a bit hazier.
We found a different relationship between velocity and stress when looking at PULSE data off the mound
Arm speed has an inverse relationship with elbow torque. Greater arm speeds appear to have less UCL stress, but arm speed only accounts for 25.5% of the variance in UCL stress (an R2 of 0.25). Arm slot accounted for none of the variance in UCL stress (so no fancy graph for this one). Finally, shoulder rotation angle accounted for 34.8% of the variance in UCL Stress. I’m not entirely sure what “shoulder rotation angle” is defining here, so I’m just going to leave it for now. Essentially, with a greater shoulder rotation angle, there is greater UCL stress.
The idea that UCL injuries are more prevalent in higher velocity pitchers is not a new one (Keller et al., 2016). Researchers from the University of Michigan found that one of the most significant predictors for elbow injury was ball speed (Whiteside et al., 2016). However, how does a change in ball speed influence UCL stress?
I used the driveline data, and I rank ordered UCL stress, and Velocity. So – there is a 1 through 20 for Velocity and Stress – which I’ll refer to as individual velocity and individual stress. I then ran a Spearman’s correlation on these data.
There was an R2 of 0.17 – essentially stating that an internal increase of velocity is associated with 17% of the increase in UCL stress. As you can see in this graph, this is not the strongest of relationships. Does a pitcher ramping up and throwing harder, within his own capacities increase stress on the arm? Possibly, but I don’t think it’s that clear.
There are a lot of other factors that go into determining how stress may change between the role of a starter and a reliever. Particularly, relievers (and relievers in the proposed role that Sanchez will fill) will be coming in for high leverage situations. Working in such a stressful situation can change kinematics, as Bill Marras’ group found when exposing those who were lifting boxes to highly stressful work environments (Marras et al., 2000). When preventing injury, recovery is one of the most important aspects of health. Relief pitchers can perform on up to three consecutive days – and while pitching only 1 inning at a time (in most cases), they still need to perform warm up pitches. Their workload is definitely different than a starter’s, but I don’t think there is enough evidence out there to support that switching from a starting role to a reliever’s role is that much of a reduction in demands on the arm.
The Blue Jays hired a high performance team to help make scientific decisions when it comes to things like monitoring a pitcher’s workload. They have a really hard decision ahead of them, and the long term health of Aaron Sanchez depends on them making the right choices.
