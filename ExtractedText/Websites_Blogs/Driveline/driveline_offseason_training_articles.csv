Understanding and Managing Training Fatigue: From Theory to Practice - Driveline Baseball,2025-02-02T18:44:24+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2025/02/understanding-and-managing-training-fatigue-from-theory-to-practice/,"The question of how much training an athlete should do has persisted since the earliest days of organized sport. While it seems simple on the surface, this fundamental question touches on some of the most complex aspects of human performance and adaptation. The evolution of training theory has taken us from simple “train until exhaustion” approaches through percentage-based programs and into the modern era of sophisticated periodization schemes. Yet at its core, effective training still comes down to understanding and managing fatigue.
Throwing programs have become a cornerstone of baseball player development. They work –pitchers in the MLB are throwing harder than ever. But beneath these surface-level improvements lies a fundamental problem: most programs take a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to account for individual differences between athletes.
Example of a throwing program designed around a set number of throws.
When asked why their programs work, trainers often point to improved mechanics. When questioned about why velocity phases are effective, they reference the SAID principle — Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands. The basic idea is that by cycling through periods of increased throwing volume and intensity, you create fatigue that drives adaptation.
This process is arbitrary. How many throws should an athlete make on a velocity day to create optimal results? What level of fatigue should be induced to maximize performance for each individual? How do you scale this process efficiently across a large group of athletes without writing 150 different programs?
Rather than viewing throwing programs as a mechanical fix, we need to start thinking about them in terms of systematic fatigue management. Fatigue drives adaptation. Specific throwing drills matters far less than the adaptation it stimulates. As Joel Jamieson notes in his book Ultimate MMA Conditioning:
“What really matters most is not the exercise you choose or the method you use, but rather the adaptations that result from using and applying them.”
The reality is that modern throwing programs are not designed to create specific stimuli to drive adaptation. There are two primary adaptations possible with throwing work: increasing impulse duration and peak force output. Yet most programs focus on mechanical adjustments, despite the fact that performance data explains more variance in throwing velocity than mechanics alone (data from the Driveline Baseball Openbiomechanics Dataset).

To develop more effective throwing programs, we need to shift our focus to managing fatigue and driving adaptation in a systematic, individualized way: “The [potential for promoting adaptation of the body] is a relative concept which should be examined and assessed in accordance with the athlete’s current fitness state” (Verkhoshansky & Siff, 2009). This is where autoregulation enters the picture.
Autoregulation has existed in various forms throughout the history of strength and conditioning. One of the earliest systematic approaches came from DeLorme during his work with injured soldiers. He discovered that allowing patients to adjust their training weights based on their performance in initial sets led to better rehabilitation outcomes than following fixed progressions. This early insight into the value of autoregulation would later influence the development of the Daily Adjustable Progressive Resistance Exercise (DAPRE) protocol by Dr. K.L. Knight in the 1970s (Mann, 2011).
Modern autoregulation methods have revolutionized fatigue management in athletic training, moving beyond rigid predetermined progressions to create dynamic programs that adjust based on individual response. This approach acknowledges that training readiness fluctuates daily due to variations in neuromuscular status, metabolic condition, and psychological factors. Rather than following fixed protocols, autoregulation relies on objective performance metrics to guide training decisions.
Adjustment charts from APRE (Mann, 2011).
Bryan Mann’s APRE (Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise) represents one of the most well-developed implementations of these principles in weightlifting. The system adjusts training loads based on 3, 6, or 10 rep maxes, with athletes increasing or decreasing weight based on their performance in the third set (Mann, 2011). This performance drop-off method establishes baseline performance using a 1-rep max, then uses third-set performance to determine fourth-set loading, creating a program that continuously adapts to the athlete’s readiness while motivating performance improvements (Mann, 2011).
These same principles can be effectively applied to throwing programs by monitoring velocity decay. Coaches establish peak velocity for each session, then track performance decline throughout the workout. Training typically continues until performance drops by a predetermined percentage — usually 4–6% for frequency-focused work or 6–10% for capacity-focused training. When performance drops exceed these thresholds, it signals a need for extended recovery between sessions.
Unlike traditional percentage-based programs, this approach automatically adjusts to the athlete’s current state of fatigue and readiness. An athlete in a well-recovered state might perform more volume before reaching the target performance drop, while an athlete carrying fatigue would reach the threshold sooner and stop training appropriately. This self-regulating nature helps prevent both under- and over-training.
The throwing athlete presents unique challenges for fatigue management. Unlike traditional resistance training, where load can be easily quantified and adjusted, throwing involves complex coordination patterns and high neuromuscular demands. However, the principles of autoregulation can be effectively adapted to throwing training through careful consideration of performance metrics and fatigue markers.
The first consideration in applying autoregulation to throwing comes from understanding the relationship between velocity and fatigue. Research has shown that throwing velocity serves as an excellent indicator of both acute and accumulated fatigue. When a pitcher’s velocity drops by a certain percentage from their initial output, it signals significant fatigue that could impact both performance and injury risk. This natural decline in velocity mirrors the performance drop-off principle used in traditional strength training autoregulation.

DeLorme’s original observations about progressive resistance become particularly relevant when we consider the throwing athlete. Just as his rehabilitation patients needed individually adjusted progressions, pitchers require personalized approaches to volume and intensity. A fixed pitch count fails to account for individual differences in fatigue resistance and recovery capacity, just as a fixed set and rep scheme would fail to optimize resistance training.
The first challenge in autoregulating throwing programs comes in establishing reliable performance metrics. While velocity provides an obvious parallel to weight in strength training, throwing performance encompasses more than just pure velocity. Command, movement quality, and perceived effort all play crucial roles in overall performance.
Every autoregulated throwing session should begin with establishing the day’s baseline. This doesn’t mean trying to throw as hard as possible on the first throw — that would be both dangerous and counterproductive. Instead, we need a systematic warmup process that builds to finding our true initial maximum for that day. This becomes our baseline for the session, from which we’ll calculate our drop-off thresholds.
In practice, implementing velocity-based drop-off thresholds requires careful attention to both numbers and movement quality. For instance, if a pitcher’s initial velocity is 90 mph, a 6% drop would occur at 84.6 mph. However, we might see mechanical breakdown before reaching this threshold, or we might see command issues while velocity remains relatively stable.
Velocity data from Jack Lambert’s (Director of Baseball Operations at Driveline Baseball) AREG throwing session.
This is where autoregulation becomes more art than science. We need to consider multiple factors:
The first factor is pure velocity drop-off. Generally, we want to cease training when velocity drops below our predetermined threshold. For a singular session on a longer recovery cycle, we might use a higher threshold (around 6% drop), while frequency-focused work on shorter recovery cycles might use a lower threshold (1–3% drop).
The second factor is mechanical efficiency. Even if velocity remains above our threshold, significant changes in mechanics signal fatigue that could lead to compensation patterns or injury risk.
The third factor involves command and movement quality. A pitcher might maintain velocity while losing significant ability to locate pitches or control movement. This often indicates neural fatigue even when raw velocity metrics remain stable.
Hans Selye’s work on the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) provides the foundation for understanding how the body responds to training stress. According to Selye the GAS is “a generalised effort of the organism to adapt itself to new conditions” (Selye). During the initial alarm phase, which lasts from minutes to hours, performance decreases as the body mobilizes its acute stress response (Selye). The resistance phase follows, lasting days to weeks, during which the body initiates adaptation processes including increased protein synthesis and improved neuromuscular efficiency. If stress continues without adequate recovery, or if a single bout of stress is too extreme, the exhaustion phase occurs, marked by a significant decline in performance that requires extended recovery.
Typical visualization of General Adaptation Syndrome.
While Selye’s model explains the general pattern of adaptation, modern training science has revealed that different systems within the body respond to stress at different rates and with different recovery patterns. Of particular importance is the response of the central nervous system (CNS), which plays a crucial role in athletic performance.
The severity of CNS fatigue provides important feedback about where an athlete is within the General Adaptation Syndrome. When an athlete experiences a performance drop of 1–9% across activities, they’re likely still within the productive resistance phase of GAS — the body is stressed but capable of adaptation. However, performance drops exceeding 10% often indicate the athlete has entered the exhaustion phase, requiring extended recovery to restore normal function.
This relationship between GAS and CNS fatigue has profound implications for training design. A properly structured program must balance the stress needed to drive adaptation with adequate recovery to prevent exhaustion. Understanding these patterns helps coaches distinguish between productive training stress that leads to adaptation and excessive stress that risks pushing athletes into exhaustion.
Understanding the relationship between CNS fatigue and performance is crucial for optimal training design. CNS fatigue manifests differently from local muscular fatigue, affecting the entire system to “protect the muscle from further peripheral fatigue” (Gandevia, 2001).
When an athlete experiences CNS fatigue, performance typically drops by 1–9% across all activities. This global decrease serves as a key indicator of systemic fatigue — a pitcher might see decreased velocity, but they’ll also see reduced performance in the weight room and diminished explosive power in movements like vertical jumps. This is precisely why many MLB teams use vertical jump testing as a readiness indicator. The vertical jump, while seemingly unrelated to pitching, provides a reliable measure of CNS freshness because it requires high-threshold motor unit recruitment and complex neuromuscular coordination.
The recovery timeline for CNS fatigue follows a predictable pattern based on the magnitude of performance decline:
However, this temporary performance decrease doesn’t mean training adaptations are lost. Vladimir Issurin called residual effects “the retention of changes induced by systematic workloads beyond a certain period of time after the cessation of training” (Issurin & Yessis, 2008).
Adapted from: Issurin, V. (2008). “Block Periodization: Breakthrough in Sports Training”
Each motor ability has its own type of residual training effect. For instance, while CNS fatigue from a high-intensity throwing session might clear in 3–5 days, the improvements in max speed can persist without detraining for up to 8 days. These residual effects are based largely on the biochemnical and neural changes that they create: “peak speed is based on very delicate and highly precise neruo-muscular interactions” (Issurin & Yessis, 2008).
The understanding that biological adaptations from fatigue drive performance increases led Issurin to develop block periodization, building on Bondarchuk’s work. The key insight was that by carefully managing training blocks, coaches could time the dissipation of fatigue while maintaining the positive adaptations. This allows athletes to peak at the right time by reducing fatigue while preserving performance gains.
The linear periodization model, pioneered by Lev Matveyev, provides a methodical framework for fatigue management in athletic training. This approach begins with high-volume hypertrophy work at relatively low intensities, then systematically reduces volume while increasing intensity throughout the training cycle. The progression culminates in a peaking phase timed to optimize competitive performance (Verkhoshansky & Siff, 2009).
Wave-like basic linear periodization scheme from Lev Matveyev.
While this approach has produced results for many athletes, it fails to account for individual recovery patterns and may not effectively maintain all training qualities throughout the program. The rigid structure can be particularly problematic for athletes in sports requiring year-round performance of multiple fitness qualities.
Undulating periodization emerged as an alternative approach, varying training stimuli more frequently to better maintain multiple fitness qualities. Instead of progressing linearly through training phases, undulating periodization alternates between different types of training stress either daily or weekly. This more frequent variation often proves better suited to athletes needing to maintain multiple performance qualities simultaneously, though it still relies on predetermined progressions rather than individual response.
Typical undulating periodization scheme. As intensity increases volume tends to decrease. Both generally increase over the macro-cycle, but this undulating relationship is still observed.
Block periodization, created by Dr. Bondarchuck, takes yet another approach by concentrating training loads for specific qualities in focused blocks. This system begins with an accumulation block emphasizing work capacity and technical development, followed by a transmutation block converting general abilities to sport-specific qualities, and concluding with a realization block for peaking performance (Issurin & Yessis, 2008). While more sophisticated than linear progression, this approach still doesn’t fully address individual variation in fatigue response and recovery.
At its core, periodization is about strategically managing fatigue to optimize adaptation. While traditional periodization models focus on long-term fatigue management, modern throwing programs require a more nuanced understanding of how fatigue accumulates and dissipates across different timeframes.
Training creates both acute and residual fatigue. Acute fatigue manifests as temporary performance decreases within a single session, while residual fatigue accumulates across multiple sessions and can take weeks to fully dissipate. The art of periodization lies in balancing these different types of fatigue to create optimal training effects.
Linear periodization manages this balance through systematic reduction in volume over time. As volume decreases, the accumulated residual fatigue begins to dissipate, allowing adaptations to become fully expressed. Think of it like slowly lifting your foot off the brake pedal — as fatigue (the brake) reduces, performance naturally rises.
Undulating periodization takes this same principle but applies it on a smaller scale. Rather than waiting weeks or months for fatigue to dissipate, undulating approaches create mini-cycles of accumulation and realization. Wave loading provides a perfect example: heavier sets create both fatigue and a potentiation effect, while subsequent lighter sets allow some fatigue to clear while taking advantage of the potentiation.
This understanding of fatigue management translates directly to throwing program design through two distinct phases: accumulation and intensification.
During accumulation, we deliberately build residual fatigue through frequent exposure to throwing stress. This phase typically employs what Buchenholtz termed “frequency toleration,” where weekly velocity drops of around 6% are distributed across multiple sessions. For example:
Example of a frequency toleration phase in a throwing program.
This distribution creates a wave-loading effect within the week — another example of undulating periodization principles at work. The varying daily demands (2% vs 1% vs 3%) allow partial recovery between sessions while maintaining consistent adaptive stress.
The power of this approach comes from its frequency. Many pitchers never experience high-intensity throwing three times per week outside of structured training programs. This novel stimulus, while fatiguing, creates powerful adaptations when properly managed.
The intensification phase shifts focus from distributed stress to concentrated loading: “the goal here is to teach our system how to tolerate relatively immense fatigue” (Buchenholz, 61). Rather than spreading a 6% weekly drop across multiple sessions, we might see a single session creating the 6% drop. This appears counterintuitive — how does a larger acute drop represent “intensification”?
An example of a capacity phase in training, also called intensification.
The answer lies in residual fatigue. As the accumulated fatigue from the frequency phase dissipates, the athlete’s true capacity for intensity emerges. The larger acute drops possible during this phase reflect not greater fatigue, but rather greater access to the athlete’s enhanced capacity developed during accumulation.
Think of it like removing sandbags from a hot air balloon. The accumulated fatigue from the frequency phase acts like sandbags, limiting how high (intense) we can go. As this residual fatigue dissipates during the intensification phase, we can access higher absolute intensities even though each session creates more acute fatigue.
Beginners benefit uniquely from training with a full spectrum of implements, from very light to very heavy balls. While this might seem counterintuitive — wouldn’t it be simpler to master one implement first? — there are several key reasons why concurrent training accelerates development in novice throwers.
First, beginners have not yet developed stable attractor states or force application strategies. By exposing them to different implements early, we help them discover and explore various ways of generating force. Heavy implements teach them the importance of maintaining positions and relaxing into throws, while light implements help them understand sequencing and the role of speed in force production. This varied exposure prevents them from becoming overly reliant on a single strategy.
Think of it like learning a new language — young children often pick up multiple languages simultaneously more easily than adults learning sequentially. Their neural systems are more plastic and adaptable, allowing them to internalize different patterns in parallel. Similarly, novice athletes can more readily develop multiple throwing qualities simultaneously before movement patterns become deeply ingrained.
Additionally, beginners typically respond positively to any proper training stimulus — a phenomenon often called “beginner gains.” Their bodies are primed to adapt to new stresses, allowing them to improve across multiple physical qualities at once. A pitcher who has never trained systematically before might simultaneously:
Novice athletes have significant headroom for improvement across all physical qualities, making concurrent development both possible and beneficial. Research has shown that “the improvement of relatively lower athletic abilities doesn’t require highly concentrated training workloads” (Issurin & Yessis, 2008). This allows coaches to develop a broad base of physical capabilities and movement competencies that will support future specialization. It’s why throwing programs should be structured differently for college freshmen versus elite pitchers.
However, this concurrent approach becomes less effective as athletes advance. More trained athletes have already harvested their “beginner gains” and require more focused stimulus to continue progressing. Their neuromuscular systems have adapted to general training stress, necessitating more specific overload to drive further adaptation. This is when transitioning to vertical integration, with its emphasis on developing specific qualities while maintaining others, becomes crucial for continued development.
Understanding this progression — from concurrent development in beginners to more focused training in advanced athletes — helps coaches structure long-term athlete development more effectively. It explains why seemingly complex training with multiple implements can accelerate learning in novices, while also clarifying when and why training emphasis needs to become more specialized as athletes advance.
While concurrent linear periodization allows athletes to develop multiple physical qualities simultaneously, this approach has limitations — particularly for more advanced athletes who have moved beyond beginner gains.
This is where vertical integration, also known as conjugate periodization, provides a crucial framework for advanced development. This approach recognizes that significant adaptations in force production capabilities — both peak force and force duration — require focused, sequential training phases rather than concurrent development. As Issurin and Yessis (2008) note, “highly concentrated workloads for many qualities cannot be managed at the same time.” While throwing velocity depends on multiple physical qualities, trying to improve them all simultaneously becomes ineffective for advanced athletes. Instead, strategically emphasizing different qualities in sequence, while maintaining others through supporting work, allows for systematic development of both impulse peak and duration characteristics.
Vertical Integration for different phases in a typical throwing program. Each phase has a specific quality that will yield specific adaptations.
As Verkoshansky explains in Supertraining, the power of vertical integration lies in how “each concentrated load with one emphasis acts as the foundation for the next load with a different primary emphasis, so that pronounced adaptation occurs.” This creates a building block effect where improvements in one quality lay the groundwork for developing the next.
The building block effect of vertical integration is particularly evident in how different impulse characteristics enhance each other. When an athlete improves their ability to sustain force output for longer durations, they develop the foundation to generate higher peak forces. Similarly, as they increase their peak force capabilities, they become better equipped to maintain submaximal forces for extended periods. This creates a positive feedback loop — enhancing duration improves the potential for peak force development, while greater peak force capacity makes it easier to sustain force output for longer periods.
Peak and duration impulse training create a continuous cycle of development in throwing athletes. This diagram shows how each quality supports and enhances the other, leading to sustainable long-term performance gains.
The key to implementing vertical integration effectively comes from understanding how different training implements create distinct force-time profiles. Every throwing movement requires a specific impulse — the area under the force-time curve — to achieve the desired velocity change (previous blog discussing this concept in more depth).
However, this impulse can be achieved through different force application strategies, with each approach developing specific athletic qualities. By strategically selecting and sequencing these different methods, coaches can systematically address an athlete’s limiting factors while maintaining their strengths.
This was my visualization first-Brice Crider stole it. Examples of how equivalent momentum change can happen with different force application strategies as the are under the curve is equivalent.
Athletes seeking to improve impulse duration qualities benefit most from training with heavier implements. Like filling a bucket with a steady stream rather than a pressure washer, these overload implements create wider, flatter force-time curves with greater total force applied over longer durations. The increased inertia promotes relaxation and position efficiency, as fighting against the mass becomes counterproductive. In fact, Brice Crider emphasizes that “there’s a certain level of relaxation necessary to create the ‘pull’ needed to throw overload implements well, because of how much more difficult it is to change its state of motion.”
Example of a more duration dominant impulse.
The development of peak force qualities demands a different approach. “Underload implements will have significantly higher peak forces, and rates of force development, resulting in a much sharper, shorter force curve” (Crider, 2025). These lighter implements, with their lower inertia, act as sensitive detectors of technical flaws, providing immediate feedback when sequencing or positioning breaks down. Through this magnification of mechanical errors at higher velocities, athletes can both refine their movement patterns and develop explosive qualities.
Example of a peak dominant impulse.
The distinction between peak force and total force becomes crucial when emphasizing different implements. Both excessive total force (from implements that are too heavy) and excessive peak force (from maximal effort throws with very light implements) can create injury risk if progressed too aggressively. The key lies in gradually building tolerance to the type of force application that addresses the athlete’s primary limitation while maintaining transfer to competition implements.
This is where intelligent training structure becomes critical. While vertical integration emphasizes developing one specific quality, other qualities still need maintenance stimulus to prevent regression. The solution lies in strategically varying training intensity across sessions — called weekly undulating periodization. High-intensity sessions focus purely on the primary training emphasis — whether that’s force duration with overload implements or peak force with underloads. These focused sessions create the specific adaptations needed for improvement.
However, lower intensity and recovery sessions serve a different but equally important purpose. These sessions maintain overall throwing capability through movement variability — using the full spectrum of implement weights. This variety in lighter sessions serves multiple purposes: it prevents the loss of qualities not currently emphasized, helps maintain movement pattern flexibility, and reduces the risk of overuse from excessive repetition of a single pattern. Think of it like cross-training for a runner — easy days might include swimming or cycling to maintain fitness while reducing stress on running-specific patterns.
This structured variation — focused, single-quality emphasis on high-intensity days combined with broader movement exploration on recovery days — creates an optimal balance. The athlete gets the concentrated stimulus needed for improvement in their primary limitation while maintaining overall throwing capability through varied movement patterns at lower intensities. This focused yet balanced approach typically produces better long-term results in advanced athletes than trying to improve everything simultaneously.
Rest between throws represents one of the most powerful yet underutilized training variables. The duration of rest intervals directly impacts both the type and magnitude of adaptation we can create. Understanding this relationship allows us to better align recovery periods with our intended training outcomes.
Types of rest necessary for different types of training, Viktor Seluyanov.
Viktor Seluyanov’s research helps illuminate two critical training zones that produce distinct adaptations:
Alactic Capacity Training uses shorter rest periods (30–90 seconds) with more sets (10–12). This compressed rest creates progressive muscular fatigue while maintaining high neural output. Think of it like interval training — the shortened recovery means each subsequent effort builds on the fatigue of previous throws. This accumulated fatigue drives adaptations in the muscle’s ability to sustain output, improving work capacity. These shorter rest periods also mirror many game scenarios, particularly with the introduction of pitch clocks.
Alactic Power Training requires longer rest periods (2–5 minutes) with fewer sets (5–6). This extended recovery allows complete restoration of both neural and muscular systems between efforts. It’s analogous to a sprinter taking full recovery between maximum effort runs — the goal is to maintain peak output without accumulating fatigue. This format optimizes the development of pure power and velocity.
The relationship between implement selection and rest periods becomes particularly important when designing training sessions. Impulse duration-dominant training with overload implements typically benefit from shorter rest periods, as the wider force-time curves align well with capacity-focused rest intervals. This connection exists because wider force-time curves create greater muscular fatigue — the extended time under tension means muscle fibers are being recruited and stressed for longer periods during each throw.
Conversely, impulse peak-dominant training with underload implements usually requires longer rest periods. The sharp, narrow force-time curves and high neural demands of lightweight implements need fuller recovery to maintain quality. When we train with underload implements, we’re primarily targeting nervous system adaptations — specifically, how quickly the system can recruit and relax muscle fibers.
This type of neural training places unique demands on the system. Each throw requires precise coordination of rapid muscle fiber recruitment and relaxation, much like a sprinter needs perfect timing to achieve maximum velocity. Just as a sprinter wouldn’t perform maximum-effort sprints with minimal rest, we don’t want to rush between high-intensity throws with underload implements. The nervous system needs adequate recovery time to maintain the quality and precision of these rapid contractions.
When rest periods are too short with underload implements, muscular fatigue can become the limiting factor rather than neural capability. This defeats the purpose of using lighter implements — we’re trying to challenge the speed of muscle recruitment, not the muscles’ endurance. It would be like trying to practice your fastest sprints while already tired from running — you simply can’t access your true speed capabilities in a fatigued state.
Like any training variable, rest periods should be periodized throughout the training cycle. Early phases might emphasize longer rest to optimize absolute output and movement quality. As competition approaches, rest periods can be compressed to enhance specific conditioning. The crucial point is ensuring both qualities — power and capacity — receive appropriate training emphasis through deliberate manipulation of rest intervals.
This balanced approach recognizes that optimal performance requires both the ability to express maximum power and the capacity to sustain that output across multiple efforts. Strategic variation of rest periods helps develop both qualities while maintaining transfer to competition demands.
Let me help structure this real-world example to better illustrate how the principles we’ve discussed come together in practice. Here’s how I would organize this case study:
Understanding the athlete’s context is crucial for program design. As a minor league reliever for the Mets, Hejka’s training needs were shaped by several key factors:
– Role as a reliever (frequent, high-intensity outings)
– Early offseason phase focusing on strength development
– Recent completion of competitive season with high throwing frequency
The program began with a capacity-focused phase that aligned with his concurrent strength training. Following vertical integration principles, we emphasized overload implements (9/7/5oz) during velocity sessions to match the duration-dominant nature of his strength work.
Wave loaded capacity phase for Josh Hejka
This phase featured:
– Once weekly velocity sessions with progressive drop-off targets
– Wave-loading pattern over four weeks (2%, 3%, 2%, 4% velocity drop-offs)
– Extended rest periods between throws despite using heavy implements
This last point might seem counterintuitive — using longer rest periods with overload implements typically associated with shorter rest. However, the goal was to maximize the quality of duration-dominant work rather than building fatigue resistance. Since Hejka would face plenty of compressed rest periods during the season, this phase prioritized his ability to produce maximum force over longer durations without accumulated fatigue interfering.
The second phase shifted focus to more game-specific demands through increased throwing frequency.
Frequency training plan for Josh Hejka
The frequency phase marked a significant shift in training emphasis, moving toward more game-specific demands through increased throwing frequency. This phase’s comprehensive approach integrated multiple weekly throwing sessions with carefully structured wave-loaded weekly drop-offs and rest durations. The programming implemented weekly undulating periodization in intensity distribution and orchestrated a methodical progression from underload implements to competition weight (5oz) balls. Compared to the previous phase, rest periods were deliberately compressed to better simulate actual game conditions and enhance sport-specific adaptations.
The design of this phase reflected several critical training principles that guided its implementation. Training demands progressed systematically from general to specific, while implement selection evolved from varied options early in the phase to predominantly competition-specific implements. Hejka encountered progressively challenging fatigue management scenarios that closely replicated in-season demands. Throughout this progression, careful attention to drop-off monitoring ensured adherence to autoregulatory principles, maintaining the delicate balance between stimulus and recovery.
This real-world example demonstrates how theoretical principles — vertical integration, autoregulation, and proper rest period manipulation — can be applied systematically to address an athlete’s specific needs and constraints. The program’s progression from capacity development to specific preparation illustrates the importance of proper phase sequencing in throwing program design.
Most autoregulatory throwing programs begin with a frequency phase characterized by conservative weekly drop-offs. Starting with just 2–3% weekly velocity decline allows athletes to gradually build workload tolerance. As athletes adapt, we progressively increase the weekly fatigue to around 6%. This steady accumulation of training stress creates residual fatigue over time, effectively transitioning the frequency phase into an accumulation phase.
Example of a capacity phase with wave loaded dropoffs.
Athletes typically demonstrate progressive velocity improvements through the capacity phase, usually peaking around weeks 2–3. This performance peak signals readiness for retesting and beginning the next training cycle. The systematic progression from frequency to capacity phases, guided by careful monitoring of drop-offs and fatigue, allows athletes to build both workload tolerance and absolute performance capabilities while managing fatigue appropriately.
This framework preserves the key principles of autoregulation — individualizing training stress based on performance feedback — while providing enough structure to guide program design decisions. The careful attention to drop-off percentages, implement selection, and phase transitions helps optimize adaptation while managing fatigue effectively.
The evolution of fatigue management in throwing programs represents a significant advancement in sports performance training. By combining the foundational principles of autoregulation with modern understanding of neuromuscular fatigue, coaches can now develop truly individualized programs that optimize both performance and recovery. The key lies in recognizing that fatigue is not simply a limitation to be avoided, but rather a critical training variable that, when properly managed, drives adaptation and improvement.
The integration of careful drop-off monitoring, strategic phase manipulation, and implement variation creates a robust framework for long-term athlete development. This approach moves beyond traditional “one-size-fits-all” programming to account for individual differences in fatigue response and recovery capacity. By carefully balancing frequency and intensity through accumulation and intensification phases, coaches can help athletes push their performance boundaries while maintaining sustainable training practices.
Perhaps most importantly, modern autoregulatory approaches provide a systematic way to quantify and manage what coaches have intuitively understood for generations — that athletes need different stimuli on different days to optimize their development. As our understanding of fatigue management continues to evolve, the principles outlined here provide a solid foundation for developing throwing programs that maximize performance while minimizing injury risk. The future of throwing program design lies not in rigid adherence to predetermined volumes or intensities, but in the intelligent application of autoregulatory principles guided by careful monitoring of individual response to training stress.

Executing a Remote Pitch Design with Online Training - Driveline Baseball,2023-01-11T16:06:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2023/01/executing-a-remote-pitch-design-with-online-training/,"A few months ago, F5 Sports and Driveline Baseball partnered to give athletes a chance to pair the pitchLogic ball with Driveline Online Pitching. In the months since we have started to build out reports and refine strategies to help athletes around the world get the same world-class pitch design feedback that they would encounter in-gym.
In pursuit of becoming the most data-driven remote training product on the market, we have come away with some impressive takeaways.
But first, a refresher…
What is pitchLogic?
PitchLogic is a “smart” baseball that uses an Inertial Movement Unit (IMU) to track ball flight for its users. Pitchers can get feedback like velocity, movement, spin rate, and extension.
The most profound advantage to using pitchLogic when comparing it to its competitors comes in its cost. Many similar units cost several thousand dollars to obtain similar information and are often unattainable for younger athletes.
We are often asked about the intricacies of how each pitch-tracking system ends up tracking pitch movement metrics. A simplistic way of viewing this comes in understanding observed versus inferred ball flight metrics.
Inferred ball flight metrics are captured by taking a snapshot of a pitcher’s release point and then projecting what the movement of that pitch would look like. This is usually seen in units like Rapsodo.
Observed ball flight metrics track the whole trajectory of a pitches descent toward home plate and then gives the user a reading. Units like Trackman fall into this category.
The use of an Inertial Movement Unit (IMU) is quite unique in comparison to other units. Instead of tracking ball flight, the pitchLogic uses the amount of force imparted on the ball to provide its feedback. Though different than other units, Samford’s Center of Sports Analytics’ initial testing of the pitchLogic showed promising results when compared to Rapsodo’s 2.0 pitching unit.
Recently, the Research & Development team at Driveline Baseball has been hard at work producing actionable reports to summarize and quantify your training with pitchLogic. Now with the help of TRAQX and EDGE, you can take two simple steps to get a post-action report from your session.
With those simple steps you can gain insights like:
How your current arsenal grades against your peers via our pitch model known as Stuff+
Recommendations on how you could adjust your arsenal for maximum effectiveness
And different grips, cues and tips to help take your arsenal to the next level
A few online athletes have been diligent in their use of pitchLogic to gain a better understanding of their arsenals. Advantage Plan athlete Justin Silva sticks out for his insatiable desire to improve every facet of his game. After getting a pitchLogic ball, Justin threw a lower-intensity session to test out the after-action reports.
After showing him how to run the reports, we started evaluating how his arsenal could be shaped in the future.
Upon an initial investigation, the slider stood out as an above-average pitch. The ability to maximize horizontal break near a 9:00 axis was a good sign that this pitch was above average and did not need to be touched.

Going forward our biggest focus would be holding the vertical plane while maximizing the maximum amount of horizontal break possible.

The one glaring weakness of the slider was its proclivity towards getting right handed hitters out, but struggling against left handed hitters. Something referenced by one of my favorite articles of 2022 by Ben Clemens.

This led us to hypothesize different strategies to attack left-handed hitters in the upcoming season. The two pitches that stood out the most here were a cutter and a changeup due to their ability to get opposite-handed hitters out (platoon neutral).
From @LanginTots13 Pitching Analytics course
With a new cutter and old changeup grip Justin went into his next training session with a clear idea on what we were attacking.
After some tinkering, the next session showed us that the changeup had a considerably higher ceiling than the cutter. Therefore, we moved forward with using the changeup as a platoon-neutral pitch to attack left-handed hitters.

Thomas Ruwe: From not pitching in High School to throwing 98 MPH,2021-11-24T02:34:18+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/11/thomas-ruwe-from-not-pitching-in-high-school-to-throwing-98-mph/,"By Chris Langin, Pitching Trainer
“Why don’t you just play basketball?”
This question followed Thomas Ruwe growing up. There’s not exactly a surplus of 6 foot 7 inch human beings in the state of Nebraska, and given an unimpressive start to his baseball career, the hypothesis was he wasn’t participating in a sport that best leveraged his genetic gifts.
“The main reason I didn’t play basketball is because I never really loved it,” said Ruwe. “Another reason was I had a chest condition that affected my breathing. I had to have surgery on it before my senior year of high school. They literally put a metal bar in my chest and it stayed there until my second year of junior college.”
If the video doesn’t do it justice, the statistics, or lack thereof, suggested that Ruwe’s baseball career wouldn’t last long. He had one career varsity outing during his high school career and a fastball that never eclipsed 75 miles per hour.
“There were a lot of frustrations in high school,” said Ruwe. “It seemed like I was always battling some sort of injury. I really was not very good. The only reason I even had a varsity outing was because I couldn’t play on junior varsity as a senior.”
For most, after getting one sympathetic varsity outing in their high school career, the thought of playing college baseball wouldn’t even register. Ruwe had two things going for him, though.
For one, he was 6’7” and still growing. Second, and perhaps most vital, colleges are always in need of extra bodies to contribute toward their tuition costs.
“I remember going on a few college visits, but I wasn’t getting recruited for baseball. I was just going to see the campus and potentially walk on. Eventually, I reached out to the coach at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa. The coach sat me down and told me if I came there I would have to work my tail off because I would get redshirted immediately.”
Ellsworth was coming off a 17-win-season and couldn’t foresee a way that Ruwe could help them the following season. Ruwe, having literally no leverage to play elsewhere, enrolled at Ellsworth and began his college career.
“The first year at Ellsworth was full of a lot of realizing how much I needed to improve in order to compete at the junior college level. I only threw around 74 mph my first year.”
Following the redshirt season, Ruwe finally got an opportunity to display his talents in the spring of 2015. He managed a 9.85 ERA and walked 29 batters against 23 strikeouts in 28.1 innings pitched. His fastball velocity was in the high 70’s.
“I had a lot of walks and gave up a lot of runs, but for some reason I was adamant I could play at that level.”
He followed up that 2015 campaign by breaking his back into two places. As a result, he spent six months in a back brace. Ruwe wouldn’t throw a single pitch during the 2016 season. Every time he pitched during his third season his back got a little more sore.
“It wasn’t until my mom came and watched me throw in front of some scouts that I realized I had been pushing it too far,” Ruwe said. “I came off the mound and tried to sit in the dugout and essentially collapsed from pain in my back.”
Now a 4th year sophomore, Ruwe transferred to the University of Nebraska-Kearney and managed to earn a $1000 scholarship.
“When I got to UNK, I was just happy to be there. Happy to still be playing the game. I don’t think coaches had a lot of expectations for me… hell, I had little expectations for me,” Ruwe said.
During 2017, Ruwe was healthy enough to pitch, but was rarely needed. He wasn’t on the travel squad most weekends, and he once again walked more hitters than he struck out. He put up a 10.54 ERA.
Through four years of college, Ruwe’s best two seasons were likely the ones he spent redshirted. He had a career ERA north of 10, had walked 40 batters against just 33 strikeouts, and had suffered significant injuries.
“Ruwe was anywhere from 82 to 87 and struggled to throw strikes consistently,” said Andrew Riddell, who pitched with Ruwe at Nebraska-Kearney. “He was coming off previous back surgeries and couldn’t do the same workouts as the other guys on the roster and didn’t throw many innings at all. I thought his career would be over after college, as did many more.”
In 2018, he finally had some success, putting up a 4.35 ERA and striking out more batters than he walked for the first time in his career. He touched 90 for the first time during that fall, though he still sat around 84-86. Nonetheless, he was 23 years old. His story seemed destined to max out as going from a junior college walk on to an average Division II reliever.
“In the fall of my second year at Kearney, I would be ecstatic about throwing 88 and the prospect of touching 90 seemed a lot more intriguing, and I started putting more value in that. This may or may not have been because my college teammate Chris Langin—who was also my roommate—was into Driveline and their products early on, but to be honest I was still skeptical of the program at that time,” Ruwe said.
Nebraska-Kearney’s baseball program was cut following 2018. Ruwe transferred to Missouri Western for his 6th and final season of college. He put up his best season, striking out 41 against just 10 walks. Which is what you’d hope for from someone 2-3 years older than the average player on the field. He converted from reliever to starter halfway through the season, but suffered an arm injury right before the conference tournament.
“Once I got to Missouri Western, it was another challenge getting acclimated to a new program and a new pitching coach,” said Ruwe. “My arm slot slowly got lower and lower. We didn’t really use radar guns at Missouri Western, so I never really knew exactly how hard I was throwing. On the rare occasion we pulled it out, I was around 84-89.”
Following the arm injury he suffered prior to the conference tournament, Ruwe was pulled aside and told in no uncertain terms to “pitch through it,” seeing as he wouldn’t have a career after college.
“By the time I left Missouri Western, I had a busted arm and a busted love for baseball… but I stood on the field at the conference tournament and promised myself I wasn’t done yet,” Ruwe said.
Unfortunately, Ruwe wasn’t coming off a mild case of elbow inflammation. He was diagnosed with a partially torn UCL during the summer. He got a Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injection, which you aren’t exactly guaranteed to come back from, and wouldn’t be ready for 100% intensity for six months.
He was now 24-years-old, had a partially torn UCL, topping out at 91 on the best of days, and was coming off an average season against a bunch of 21-year-olds at a Division II school in the Midwest.
While he was adamant that he would continue trying to play following the conference tournament, some realities of life were becoming apparent.
“It really was a back and forth trying to decide if it even made sense for me to continue. I debated it a lot and there was a period where I almost decided it wasn’t for me. I worked on my family farm to help my dad in the summer. I didn’t find out what was wrong with my arm until the middle of June.”
As cliche as it sounds, Ruwe felt there was still “something whispering in my ear that I wasn’t done yet.”
“After saving up every bit that I could and a few frantic conversation with Julianne (now his wife) and Chris, I purchased my Driveline subscription and prepared to drive across the country with not much more than a dream and a belief that there was more left for me to give in my baseball career.”
In March 2020, Ruwe began his training at Driveline. It started off great; he hit 92 for the first time in his career.

But before the end of his first week, the COVID-19 pandemic closed down the Driveline facility.
“I was at Driveline for three days and had gotten one lifting session in when Chris called me and told me that Driveline was shutting down to in-gym athletes because of COVID policies. I went to train with an old summer ball teammate in the area who had a place for me to sleep and we trained together for a month while I waited to see if Driveline would open back up.”
“I drove back home to continue training at the facility in Fremont, Nebraska with Steve (his trainer since high school),” said Ruwe. “There I saw 95 off the mound for the first time in my career. In an empty gym, with no music playing, just a few high schoolers holding radar guns and Steve recording. I was performing my drop steps and walking windups as part of my online training with the annual plan and sending videos to Chris.”

During the summer, Driveline opened up a pop-up shop in Arizona. Ruwe traveled there and finally threw on radar tech for the first time in his career. There, Ruwe had his first pleasant surprise in his career. He was possibly the best in the world at spinning a fastball.
It still wasn’t all that good.
“We got to see my numbers on Rapsodo for the first time and learned that I could spin the ball really well. However, I was missing out on a ton of vertical and horizontal break because my efficiency was hovering around 70%. I was missing out on close to 1000 RPMs, rendering the skill of being able to spin the ball that well rather useless.”
The pitch didn’t have what you’d call “useful” cut for a fastball. It wasn’t getting true glove side action (think Corbin Burnes), much less relative cut (think Max Fried). While he could spin the ball over 3000 RPMs, he was getting less total movement than the average big league pitcher. Even when he maxed out in velocity, at 94-95 mph, he was still throwing a pitch that graded out nearly 50% below the average big league fastball.
The good news? You can’t really teach someone to impart that much raw spin on a fastball. But, you can teach them how to put a higher proportion of that spin towards useful movement. While getting the velocity up to a level that could get him signed was still of chief interest, we kept a keen eye on how his spin efficiency was progressing on the heater. A good portion of throwing economy went towards reps with Rapsodo feedback, providing cues that would enhance his efficiency.
We knew his raw RPMs would go down a bit, as inadvertent cut increases raw RPMs on fastballs (controlling for velocity change). For reference, of pitchers that averaged over 2500 RPMs on their four-seamers in 2021, the average spin efficiency was 84%, 8% below the big league average of 92%. But again, maximizing raw spin isn’t the end goal for maximizing the effectiveness of a fastball.
“That became a big goal, along with putting on more weight,” said Ruwe, “My lowest hanging fruits, if you will.”
The Washington Driveline opened up again in July 2020 and Ruwe could finally get his strength assessment in.
Historically a “hard gainer,” Ruwe had struggled for years to put on weight. His back issues had prevented him from doing many core lifts that most pitchers had no issues executing. Despite being 6’9”, his bodyweight wasn’t reliably above 200 pounds throughout his college career.
“I have always been trying to gain weight, but for so long I was also growing and wasn’t done developing into my adult body until I was almost 23,” Ruwe said.
When Ruwe went through his first strength assessment in July of 2020, his Squat Jump Peak Power (strongest correlator in HP dataset to velocity) of 4,770 watts was more than a standard deviation below his peers in the 90+ mph group. His force plate numbers were rather pathetic, with absolute and relative strength ranking in just the 2nd and 3rd percentile respectively amongst 90+ mph peers.
“I got back to Seattle after a month in Arizona and was putting more training economy into the weight room. I gained about 10 pounds and was moving really well down the mound during my lower intensity throwing. I used to think gaining weight was super difficult because I wasn’t eating enough.”Ruwe tried lots of things to gain weight, downing chocolate milk and eating ramen every night.“The game changer was when I started tracking my calories and made it a priority,” Ruwe said. “Knowing that my weight gain would have a big correlation to my gains on the mound…It forced me to own it or go home.”
Just 77 days later, he had gained nearly 1,000 watts on his jumps. His peak power had gone from being comparable to an average 19-year-old junior college pitcher to being firmly in the middle of the 90+ group. He had gotten up to 97 on his grey drop steps during his “end of week” throws.
“They gave me 3-5 throws to “let it eat” at high intensity at the end of each week, and I really looked forward to that. Other than that, they delegated everything towards getting stronger in the weight room.”
His relative and absolute strength improved significantly as well. Relative to 90+ mph throwers, Ruwe went from being in the 3rd and 2nd percentile in absolute and relative strength to the 57th and 33rd percentile over those two and a half months. A quick peek at his radar chart speaks for itself.
Based on our HP database, even if Ruwe were to not have had any improvements to his throwing mechanics, we’d expect a 2.9 MPH gain just because of the gains he made on the high performance side.
“The biggest thing in the weight room strength-wise was never running another pole since college,” Ruwe joked. “Realistically, just being on a schedule that was conducive to my throwing volume was the biggest thing. Prior to Driveline, I never prioritized recovering and didn’t match up my throwing well with my lifting.”
About a week before his September retest, on August 29th, Ruwe had a career changing day. During his “end of week” throws, he was feeling pretty good (and to be honest, he made a few more throws than the five he was prescribed, but dammit if it wasn’t for good reason).
Not everyday you see a 6’9″ human being performing a 🔥🔥🔥 Drop Step that isn’t in the low post. @ruwe_1995 pic.twitter.com/NrVikn6T0f
He took home four velo records at Driveline. The 225g step back, and all the drop step records except for the 450g ball. While it wasn’t a baseball, he saw triple digits on the radar gun for the first time in his life.
“Seeing triple digits light up on the radar gun for the first time was a top three feeling in my life, behind marrying my wife and my first professional save,” Ruwe said. “Getting my name on the record wall at Driveline was kind of the culmination of so much hardship and struggle and finally seeing some actual evidence of the work paying off.”
Following the conclusion of Ruwe’s strength phase, it was time to see if the velocity would convert to the 5 ounce baseball off the mound.
At this point, enough moderate intensity Rapsodo work had been done that he was no longer inadvertently cutting his fastball. There were still issues with it, specifically that it was in the “dead zone,” but his spin was significant enough to offset some vulnerabilities that come with that type of fastball. Nonetheless, every tick he could get on his fastball would be needed to get signed.
In his motion capture retest, he destroyed his previous personal best off the mound. He sat 95-96, peaking at 96.8, just a tenth of a tick below the record in the lab for 230+ pound pitchers.

Compared to his initial motion capture in March, he saw significant improvements in nearly all variables that are associated with increases in velocity—specifically, his kinematic velocities.
Throughout his first athlete meeting, the biggest points of interest were improving elbow flexion and hip-shoulder separation.
3-13-2020: Max: 103, FP: 85
9-10-2020: Max: 120, FP: 98
3-13-2020: Max: 2370
9-10-2020: Max: 2650
Elbow flexion plays a moderate role in enhancing a pitcher’s ability to increase the velocity at which they extend their elbow. Ruwe increased his max elbow flexion by 17 degrees. Throughout the entire dataset, the r value between max elbow flexion and max elbow extension angular velocity is 0.33. When looking at intra-athlete correlations, the r value is still 0.18. That’s enough to emphasize it given its teachability and its impact on increasing elbow extension velocity, one of the stronger correlations to ball velocity in the entire dataset.
3-13-2020: 180
9-10-2020: 192
Ruwe also increased how much shoulder external rotation (layback) he got in the throw. While it’s foolish for anyone to try to say exactly which portion of the training improved this, we know that external rotation is extremely valuable for producing ball velocity, as it allows the athlete to apply force to the baseball for a longer period of time.
Ruwe certainly wasn’t hurt by his increase in elbow flexion here, as it is generally easier to get into more external rotation when pulling back a shorter lever. His elbow flexion improved at max ER as well, when that would appear to be most useful for enhancing this range of motion.
Admittedly, and an excellent case study in the need to be vulnerable in your initial assessment, Ruwe actually lost hip-shoulder separation despite throwing four miles per hour harder. While his drills were tailored towards enhancing this separation, it didn’t happen. With the history of his back issues, it’s possible that his back was a limiting factor. That said, he found another way to generate elite velocity despite being told 6 months prior that improving hip-shoulder separation would be vital in his pursuit of 95+.
This points to the value of self-organization rather than prescribing exact mechanical changes. If the athlete sees improvement without improving mechanically in departments you inferred would aid in their velocity development, your priors should be updated.
At the end of the day, the gains in the weight room likely attributed to most of the improvement in Ruwe’s velocity during that 6-month window.
After a couple weeks of getting back a feel for the slope, Ruwe was ready to showcase his arsenal. He had just turned 25 and the 2020 MLB off-season had begun. Despite the unbelievable gains he had made over the last 6 months, he still needed to put on a clinic to have a chance at getting signed.
MiLB teams were getting cut, and the lack of a minor league season didn’t offer any opportunities for pitchers in organizations to pitch themselves out of a job. His college statistics were brutal, and nobody knew what his command would look like with an additional 10 miles per hour behind his pitches.
After generating some initial interest by sitting 96-97, a Brewers scout was sent to watch Ruwe pitch a week later. Everything clicked, with him sitting 96-97 again, and setting another personal best in velocity, this time at 97.9.
Top Heaters from @ruwe_1995 yesterday. Came to Driveline in March and set a PR at 92.9 during his motion capture… things seem to be going… well. Reliably ~29-3000 RPM’s on the Fastball during this + previous bullpens. @FlatgroundApp pic.twitter.com/KZXySP5SZu
“Throwing in front of the Brewers scout was a mix of emotions. I was excited that a scout finally, for the first time in my career, took interest in me. It was also nerve-racking because that was the only team looking into me.”
A week later, Ruwe had created a bit of leverage with his performances. With multiple teams in the running, he wound up signing a professional contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. The kid who couldn’t break 90 miles per hour two years prior, and was recovering from a partial UCL tear a year ago, was now inking an affiliate contract at 25-years-old with a $20,000 signing bonus.
While the impossible had happened for Ruwe, there was still work that needed to be done to increase the probabilities he could climb up the system.
That started with fixing that dead zone fastball.
“Chris had mentioned his concerns with my fastball profile previously, but felt to make changes we’d need a decent amount of time in a stress-free environment. Seeing as I was trying to get signed, that wasn’t the time to make that change,”
To get Ruwe out of the dead zone, he’d have to change the spin direction of his fastball. Re-patterning the throw like this is seldom practical. The benefits that come with a more over the top slot (for those stuck in the dead zone) are quite obvious—and, undoubtedly, more people would attempt this if success rates were high. Anecdotally, significant manipulation of anterior trunk tilt like this often leads to an unnatural movement for an athlete, thus risking a decrease in velocity.
However, when you’re 25-years-old and not anywhere near a prospect, you have little to lose. This made Ruwe an optimal candidate for experimentation.
Torso anterior tilt essentially “sets” up an athlete’s arm slot. The more extended they are at foot plant (over the heels), generally the higher their release height. In the GIFs above, the athlete’s respective slots are decided by their torso position at foot plant. As the torso rotates towards the plate to deliver the ball, the arm will follow behind, with the eventual result being an arm slot that stays on that same plane throughout release.
Our data fits this logic. Nearly 20% of the variability in vertical break between athletes in our database can be explained by their torso anterior tilt at foot plant.
Given Ruwe’s history of being nudged toward a sidearm delivery, there was some confidence that selling out for a higher three-quarters slot was a possibility. To date, his velocity was increasing with the more traditional three-quarter slot he was throwing from. His release height, because of his 81-inch height and 86-inch wingspan, was already relatively high (~6.3-6.4 feet) relative to big league averages (6 feet), which presented no unique benefits for his current fastball characteristics.
Looking at historical MLB data, and controlling for intra-pitcher changes in release height, a linear model would project that an increase of 1 inch in release height would cause an increase of 0.25 inches of vertical break on average.
The ultimate practical example is Justin Verlander.
Verlander improved the whiff rate on his fastball considerably, with no drastic increases in velocity, spin, or spin efficiency. The spin direction of the fastball had simply adjusted upward an additional 15-20 minutes, resulting in nearly three extra inches of carry.
After an off-season of video feedback, Rapsodo feedback, and cueing, Ruwe was able to reliably achieve the desired shape during bullpens and live at-bat settings. However, the real challenge would be whether he’d be able to maintain the profile during the season.
Prior to heading out for his first professional season, Ruwe shattered one more Plyo Ball ® record, this time reaching back for 101 on a grey step back.
“To see where he is at now and how far he has come is unbelievable,” said Ridell. “He definitely isn’t the same pitcher who was struggling for innings at a Division II University in Nebraska… he deserves everything that his hard work has got him.”
Now it was time to compete, for the first time in 2 years.
His first season got off to a cold start. He was in A-ball, 25-years-old, and couldn’t get anybody out.
Ruwe was sent to the extended site after his first 6 outings in Low-A. His velocity was back down to the low 90’s and he was struggling to find the strike zone.
“If there was a definition of a roller coaster season, it was my first one in pro ball,” Ruwe said.
After the six-outing pit stop and getting recalled from extended, he began making quick work of hitters, striking out 27 against 9 walks over 15 and a third innings pitched. That was enough to earn him a promotion to High-A.
The success carried over to High-A, where he struck out over 42% of the batters he faced. Hitters had an OPS. of .481 against him in his nine outings in Vancouver. Ruwe put up a 42% K rate and a 1.92 FIP after being recalled on June 25th. Both were 95th percentile across A and High-A relievers with at least 25 innings over that stretch.
His stuff had returned as well. While in Vancouver, his average fastball velocity was 94.3, reaching as high as 99 on the stadium radar gun. His four-seam characteristics were also exactly what we intended them to look like when making the arm slot change.
During his time in Vancouver, his spin rate would’ve ranked 1st among major league pitchers. His 21.6 inches of total movement would be amongst the top 5, behind Jharel Cotton, Demarcus Evans, and Michael Kopech.
The pitch was synonymous with the Verlander profile discussed earlier. Ruwe’s average release height was 82.5 inches, and he induced 19.3 inches of vertical break on average. The velocity was 94.3.
Verlander’s averages? 82.8 inch release height,19.5 inches of induced vertical break, and 94.8 miles per hour.
The ball flight characteristics of the pitch were good for a stuff+ of 165, 65% above a big league average fastball. The pitch had tripled in stuff from the time it was first thrown at Driveline Arizona.
He paired that with a sweeping slider, which averaged 14 inches of sweep at 81 miles per hour, good for a stuff+ of ~130 relative to big league breaking balls.
Of Ruwe’s 49 strikeouts, he got 24 of them with the four-seamer, and 25 with the slider.
Despite the success at High-A, Ruwe is still headed towards a make or break year with the Blue Jays. He’ll be 26-years-old without a single Double-A inning to his name.
If he can finish the story, and accomplish his dreams of becoming a big leaguer, he’ll be amongst the most unlikely of the 22,000 that have donned a big league jersey.
“Throughout this journey, there were a lot of places I wanted to give up, or actually, maybe some places people would think I should have given up. If there is anything I have learned, it’s that believing in yourself and having a solid support system can get you as far as your dreams will carry you. Getting to where you need to be is listening to the voice in your head telling you to try one more time.”

Caleb Thielbar: Coaching DII Baseball to 10 million dollar season,2021-11-05T23:35:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/11/caleb-thielbar-coaching-dii-baseball-to-10-million-dollar-season/,"Caleb Thielbar was over five years removed from his last pitch at the big league level. At 33, not only was he on the wrong side of the aging curve, but the talent level of the league was continuing to rise – resulting in a larger barrier for entry. When Thielbar was drafted in 2009, average fastball velocity was just above 92 miles per hour.
10 years later, it was trending towards 94.
In 2019, Thielbar spent the season in the Detroit Tigers organization, a team with the 3rd worst record (47-114) for a Major League Team since 1952. If a betting man was to develop a scenario in which Thielbar would at least get on a major league mound again, this would’ve been the optimal one.
But the call never came.“After 2019, I was pretty satisfied that I had given it everything I had and would not get another chance,” Thielbar said. “Earlier that season I had decided to be done and take a coaching job.”Six years prior, Thielbar had to have felt on top of the world. He was just 26-years-old and had finished his first big league season with a 1.76 ERA, sixth best in the American League among pitchers with at least 40 innings.
26-year-old Randolph HS graduate and South Dakota State alumnus Caleb Thielbar made his major league debut with the #MNTwins on this date in 2013.He didn’t allow a run in his first 17 major league appearances, and finished his rookie season with a 1.76 ERA and 0.826 WHIP. pic.twitter.com/qOvzFvFeI4
The left arm that had carried him to the highest levels of baseball was now limited to writing scouting reports for Augustana University, a DII school in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
We’ve heard of pitchers battling back from the minor leagues after previously being reliable big league hurlers. Some have even come back all the way from independent ball. Thielbar had spent the past four years working between both routes—but coming back from a livelihood that comprises meeting with recruits for breakfast and holding up a Stalker radar gun to 15-17-year-old kids? Not exactly the most conventional route back to the big leagues.
But for Thielbar, most of his life has been built around overcoming odds and adversity.
Thielbar competed at Randolph High School, a 1A school in Minnesota. His graduating class was comprised of just 40 people. During his senior year of high school, he had a fastball that topped out at 77 miles per hour. There wasn’t much interest from colleges.
“Not much recruitment out of high school. I went to a showcase camp at South Dakota State and that ended up being my in there. Otherwise I was likely going to a D3 school,” Caleb Thielbar said.
South Dakota State was in the middle of transitioning into a D1 program. Even after his freshman and sophomore years, the velocity wasn’t getting past the low 80’s. His freshman year statistics are almost impossible to believe for somebody who eventually played major league baseball.
In 41.2 innings, he struck out just 11 hitters. Good for 2.38 K/9 and a putrid 6% strikeout rate. He almost struck out as many hitters as he gave up home runs (8).
For reference, over the past 15 years, there have been 5061 major league seasons with at least 40 innings pitched. Only 1 season had a pitcher with a K/9 less than the 2.38 mark Thielbar showcased his freshman year.
His first major jump came during his junior year.
“I got some video analysis by Dick Mills. It wasn’t perfect, but I learned to use my lower body better as I had been all arm up to that point. Between that and really highlighting weights hard that year, I began sitting 87-89 my junior year and started attracting pro attention,” Thielbar said.
In just two years, Thielbar more than quadrupled his strikeout rate, going from whiffing 2.38 batters per 9 to 10.27. He had gone from barely reaching double digit strikeouts in 41 innings his freshman year to punching 100 tickets his junior year.
He was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 18th round at the conclusion of his 2009 season. Still, objectively, his dreams of becoming a big leaguer were slim. Just 4%, or about 1 in every 25 pitchers who were signed between the 16th-20th round from 2008 to 2012 were worth at least 1 career WAR at the big league level.
To complicate matters more, Thielbar was released just a year into his Brewers career. Similar to high school, he wasn’t highly sought after by affiliate teams. He continued his career, taking an indy ball opportunity with the St. Paul Saints, in the American Association at time.
“My mindset after the first release was that I had been training again already and ended up getting an indy ball spot pretty quick. So I just thought I’d give it a shot and see what happened,” Thielbar said. “I ended up learning a lot from some veterans on that team and it really helped me get back to a place where I was confident and effective.”
He spent the majority of 2011 with the Saints. After 43 games, the Twins called, and he began his first stint with the organization. That’s when little went wrong for Thielbar. He ascended from High A to Triple-A in 2012 and had a tremendous rookie season in 2013. He was the first player from South Dakota State to play in the big leagues in over 100 years. In 2014, he appeared in 54 games with a 3.40 ERA and 3.55 FIP.
But in 2015, the upward trend Caleb Thielbar experienced came to a screeching halt. He went from being penciled into the Twins’ bullpen for the foreseeable future to not having a job.
“After 2014 I was happy with results but I knew something was wrong after pitching through shoulder tendinitis the whole second half,” Thielbar said. “Problem was, I didn’t know what to do other than rest and hope it got better. It carried over into 2015 and led to a frustrating year.”
Thielbar’s “stuff”, which didn’t have a massive margin for error to begin with, given his 90 mph velocity, took a nosedive. The stadium radar gun rarely started with a 9. His ability to whiff batters diminished. With little room to be picky with his pitches, the walk rate started climbing as well. His K-BB rate was barely positive, at 1.6%.
To put his K-BB rate into perspective, since 2015, only 2 qualified relievers out of over 1,000 have put up a worse K-BB rate at the big league level. Thielbar was pitching like this in the Minor Leagues at 28 years old.
His poor K-BB rate, combined with the lack of velocity, was so troublesome that he received no real interest from organizations despite his MLB contributions in 2013 and 2014. He’d be heading back to the St. Paul Saints for round two.
“After the year, Brian Garman (now a minor league coach with the Cincinnati Reds) introduced me to Driveline, and I started buying in. My shoulder finally felt better, and I was able to keep pushing through those years because I had flashes of really good stuff. I’d have an outing once in a while where I’d be 91-94, but never really put it all together consistently until the last few months of 2018. Ever since then the velo has been pretty steadily the best of my career.”
Thielbar spent the next two years with the Saints. His velo trended upward, and the strikeouts returned. The Tigers took a chance on him in 2018 and signed him to a minor league deal. Despite being 31 with multiple years of service time, Thielbar threw 38 innings in Double-A. He struck out 40 and walked just three. He ended the season in Triple-A and gave it one last hurrah in 2019.
Thielbar pitched the entirety of 2019 to no avail. Despite pitching for an MLB club with little to play for, and a historically bad season, he never got an opportunity. He struck out 94 and walked just 16 in nearly 80 innings of work, but none of them were at the big league level.
From June 1st to September 1st of that year, Thielbar had what he described as “the best 3 months” of his career.
Caleb Thielbar limited hitters to an OPS of .535 and had an ERA of 1.78 and a FIP of 2.09 over that stretch. He struck out 31% of hitters he faced and walked just 6%. His trademark 69-73 mph curveball had a near 50% whiff rate.

Over that same time span, the Detroit Tigers went 18-62. The 32-year-old had returned to the 2013 version of himself and then some. If this wasn’t enough to earn a call to the big leagues, under what would’ve seemed to be  ideal of circumstances, what would be? After going back and forth on the coaching offer he received during the season, Thielbar decided it was time to move on from playing and commit to coaching.
“Having the best 3 months of my career and not getting a call up solidified my decision,” Thielbar said.
Our new pitching coach knows a thing or two about throwing the ⚾️ around!
We are excited to welcome former Twins pitcher Caleb Thielbar to Augustana Baseball!
📖: https://t.co/m8OHb5TVCR#BuildingChampions
— Augustana Baseball (@AugieBaseball) September 12, 2019
Thielbar spent the entirety of October settling into his new role as the Augustana Pitching Coach. He had gone as far as attending recruiting events in Arizona and eating breakfast with recruits.
“The first time I met him I was taking a recruit and his parents to their campus tour,” Clay Collison said, the current Augustana pitching coach. “Caleb walked out of the building we were going into and he could definitely tell I was a baseball coach. He kinda walked away, but then turned around and was like ‘are you Clay?’ The mom had overheard him introduce himself to me. She looked at me and said ‘Caleb Thielbar? That pitched for the Twins?'”
Outside of a Major League contract, there wasn’t much that would’ve convinced Thielbar to pick up his cleats again during the winter. The one exception? An opportunity to play with Team USA.
Still unconvinced of fully committing back to baseball, Thielbar saw the opportunity as a way to go out with a bang. Plus it would only cost him a few months away from his new job.
“Getting a chance to play with team USA after the 2019 season was the thrill of my life, and I figured that would be a cool way to go out,” Thielbar said.
2019 @RocRedWings OF Brent Rooker and former LHP Caleb Thielbar are on Team USA’s #Premier12 roster. https://t.co/ovcAhGdnX1
The experience also granted Thielbar a unique opportunity to extract information for his primary job. Coaching.
“One of the things we did with Team USA while preparing to go overseas was play some college teams in Arizona,” Thielbar said. “We went down to the University of Arizona and I was able to get a meeting with Nate Yeskie (now the Texas A&M pitching coach) about coaching. Just so happened that Kyle Boddy was in town too and we all ended up sitting down for about 45 minutes talking about coaching tactics and philosophy. It was a great meeting for me at that point in my coaching career and a pretty rare opportunity for a young coach.”
Thielbar also had a follow up dinner with multiple recruits during that same trip. Both ended up committing soon after.  While his coaching was off to a hot start, Thielbar’s fastball still had life on it, reaching 93 mph throughout his outings with Team USA. The stuff was still there from the previous season, and front offices likely noted the potential of his 2019 peripherals.
Caleb Thielbar is not pitching like an assistant baseball coach — which he is, at Augustana University. Impressive inning for @USABaseball, with one strikeout on a spin-tastic 71-mph curve and another on an overpowering 93-mph fastball. @GoAugie @AugustanaSD
“Half the league started calling,” Thielbar said. “Figured that was a pretty good indication I should give it another go. The Twins just offered the best opportunity and situation for me and my family.”
After having a solid Spring Training at the beginning of 2020, the pandemic hit.
Five years removed from his last pitch at the big league level, and having previously retired, perhaps this would further validate that the game had passed him over. The Twins were coming off a 101-win season, more than double the amount of wins the Tigers had.
Thielbar instead asked what he could do over that time to give him the best chance to contribute and got to work on reinventing his slider.
During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, Thielbar drove an hour twice a week to work on the slider with high-speed cameras at Augustana. Collison, who had taken over pitching coach duties from Thielbar, assisted him.
“It basically just happened one day”, Thielbar said. “Tried a different grip during a bullpen, and it looked as if it had some decent sweep from the eye test. It wasn’t until I threw on a Trackman during summer camp that we confirmed it was what we were looking for.”
When it was time to report back, Thielbar showed off his new slider. The pitch was averaging over 14 inches of sweep, or more than double what he had showcased in 2014. The pitch also maintained a high proportion of its velocity given the movement added. It was just 1.2 miles per hour slower than his 2014 averages, at 77.8 mph.
Last cool thing about pitch design and how the game is changing. Below is the number MLB player pitch types that averaged a sweeper for the entire year (min 25 pitches thrown):2015: 332016: 242017: 29—- Rapsodo is released —-2018: 362019: 412020: 422021: 70 (lmao)
The new slider, combined with the impression he had with the team during Spring Training led to him having his contract selected in early August. He threw a pitch at the big league level for the first time in nearly 2,000 days.
We love a good comeback story. 🥺For the first time since 2015, Minnesota native Caleb Thielbar (@cthielbar56) pitched in an MLB game. The @Twins reliever got emotional in his postgame interview: pic.twitter.com/xMqtG0hFBg
Since 2012, only eight pitchers have gone at least five years between pitches at the Major League level. Thielbar had gone from being unable to get an inning with a team that won 47 games to pitching in the postseason for the Minnesota Twins.
Despite defying odds for the second time in his career, it did not satisfy Thielbar.
Caleb Thielbar booked a trip to Driveline right after the season to plan for the offseason ahead of him. He leveraged the biomechanics lab for further insights on what was impeding the velocity he was looking for. His 89.8 mile per hour average in 2020 ranked in the bottom 10th percentile among lefty relievers. Of course, many could simply cite his age as a natural cause.
Thielbar’s mechanics came back synonymous to the character Mario in Mario Kart. No major weaknesses, but no true outlier traits, according to our database. Of the “Big Ten” metrics we reference in-gym, only one was significantly below average. Hip-Shoulder Separation at foot plant.
Thielbar’s 23.2 degrees of hip-shoulder separation ranked in just the 23rd percentile relative to our database. With this in mind, janitors and drop steps were crowned the drills of choice for Thielbar’s offseason.
While he had some lighter issues, specifically a slightly below average ability to stop his center of gravity at ball release, there was little reason to weight mechanics all that strongly. His deficiencies were simply not egregious, and the opportunity cost of weighting movement above velocity work with external cues and feedback made little sense.
“Velocity was down in 2020 for a variety of reasons, so I didn’t want to be complacent over the offseason,” Caleb Thielbar said. “I took on a very aggressive velocity program to try to not only restore fastball velocity, but the velocity on my breaking balls as well.”
Thielbar initially took some time off following his assessment. Following an on-ramp phase, he went through three phases with Driveline remotely: a velocity phase with Plyo Ball ®, a velocity phase with the leather weighted baseballs, and a competition/live phase in which he was prepping for spring training.
“The results speak for themselves, but I think the biggest takeaway I had was how important mound work is,” Thielbar said. “Threw all my Plyo Ball ® off the mound, Plyo Ball ® velos off the mound. weighted ball velo days off the mound. Then obviously bullpens and lives leading into spring. I felt comfortable on the mound from day 1 of spring, whereas it used to take weeks to get that feeling.”
After being a reliable arm over the 2020 shortened season for the Twins, there were no guarantees for Caleb Thielbar heading into the 2021 season. Thielbar’s decision to continue pursuing velocity and avoid being risk averse turned out to be a wise one. Even after feeling his best and pursuing every route to get better in the offseason, he was the last player selected for the Twins opening day roster in 2021.
Thielbar got off to an extremely hot start in April, ranking 2nd among relievers in K/9 with 19 and 3rd in K-BB% at 45%. His velocity during the first half of the season was 91 — a career high if it would hold into the 2nd half. While he had some tough luck with batted balls (his .354 BABIP was 8th worst among relievers at the break) he was pitching the best in his career at the tasks that are considered as being under the pitchers control, striking out hitters and avoiding walks.
Then came the second half, where Thielbar hit the accelerator on the fastball. He averaged 92 miles per hour in the 2nd half, averaging 92.3 during the last month of the season. He threw multiple fastballs 95.3 miles per hour, half a tick harder than any he had thrown at the big league level previously. His slowest fastball in September was firmer than his average heater in 2020. His velocity in the second half was good for the 40th percentile among lefties, a 30th percentile climb relative to his showing from August to October in 2020.
To further contextualize the velocity gains, the average pitcher 33 or older has lost on average about 1/3 of a mile per hour from one year to the next. Just 28% of those pitchers either keep or gain velocity from the previous season. Thielbar gained 1.5 miles per hour from his age 33 to 34 season. In the Statcast era (2015-2021) this was the 20th biggest gain in velocity for a player over the age of 33 from one season to the next.
Of those 20 players greater than 33 years old that had an increase of at least 1.5 mph from the last season, only Yu Darvish (2020) and Thielbar had career highs in velocity that season (excluding pitchers that went from starters to relievers, such as Jorge de la Rosa and Ian Kennedy).
The descriptive results were there as well. Thielbar was the most valuable reliever for the Twins when looking at bWAR (1.2). He outperformed his Steamer projection (0.2) by an entire win. His fWAR of 0.9 showed his predictive statistics were in alignment with his results on the field. Both suggest his season would’ve been worth ~$10 million dollars on the open market.
His strikeout rate (28.9%) and walk rate (7.5%) were both career bests. His 21.4% K-BB rate was good for 80th percentile among qualified relievers.
“At the end of the day, I know my stuff and command are better than they’ve ever been, and the mindset and confidence are well above where they were in my first stint as well,” Thielbar said. “As surprised as some people are with the results, it isn’t surprising for me because I know the work that has gone into it. I just needed to find the right situation and a front office willing to give me a chance.”
What about that breaking ball velocity? He picked up nearly 2.5 ticks on his slider and added an inch of sweep to it as well. The pitch had an improvement of 32 points in Stuff+, a top 15 improvement across the entire league. The curveball picked up 3 ticks, seeing a 16 point improvement.
The sweeper saw an incredible turnaround from 2020. Thielbar had decided to ditch the pitch entirely for the last month of the season due to command issues. He upped the usage from 20% to 34%. The median miss distance from his intended target went from 14.5” to just 11.6”. The Command+ of the pitch improved 22 points, from an 82 (18% below league average) to a 104 (4% above league average). He was one of just five pitchers who improved their slider Command+ by at least 20 points relative to last year.
At 27 years old, an age generally considered within the range of a pitcher’s prime, Thielbar’s slider was 79 miles per hour with 7 inches of sweep. 7 years later, the pitch averaged 80.2 miles per hour and averaged more than 15 inches of sweep. The Stuff+ of the offering went from a 75 (25% below league average) to 133 (33% above the league average).
“I think his situation is the perfect example of the development process not being linear,” Collison said. “Players at all levels get impatient or complacent when things aren’t going how they hope. This is a great example of sticking to it and working the dips in the roller coaster. You never know when things will start clicking or start working. Proof that if you keep at it and attack your process, anything can happen.”
Caleb Thielbar is an example of a pitcher who has maximized resources and technology throughout the past 5 seasons. Peaking in velocity at age 34, developing a sweeping slider, and even simulating workloads in PULSE throughout the season. The Minnesota native from a town of less than 500 people ensured no stone is unturned in the development process.
“With all the resources available for athletes these days, you really can max out your physical ability and stuff if you’re willing to put in the work,” Thielbar said.
After years of trials and tribulations, from college coach to being one of the league’s best rookies, Thielbar insists there’s still a fine line many athletes may struggle with during their development journey.
“However, while working towards that goal, many forget that the game is still about pitching and getting outs. Consistency, health, nutrition, sleep and the mental game are what will take you to the highest level your ability will allow,” Thielbar said.

I’m looking at Caleb’s last 2 videos, and I am of the opinion (based on observations with a radar gun) that he could use his front side better than what he is exhibiting in those videos. I use a term or cue “swivel up “ (where the glove goes from fingers down in aiding in the rotation to fingers up and in front of glove chest after release) to help stop or drastically reduce the stopping time of upper body rotation. This is what I refer to “stopping the merry go round to throw the kid off”. In short, Caleb may gain 1-2 mph if he can effectively unload the scapular load created by the rotation of the upper body. He is in affect doing flys one arm at a time versus using both and meeting together at the same time at the end of the fly movement. The gain is there.

Free 6-Week Strength Training Program for Baseball Players,2021-10-21T23:56:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/10/free-strength-training-program-baseball/,"By Steffen Simmons and Daniel Comstock, High Performance
Driveline High Performance staff members are regularly asked by well-meaning parents and athletes something along the lines of, “What is the best strength program for baseball players?” While the question is valid, the unfortunate answer is: “It depends.” There is no best one-size-fits-all program.
When an athlete comes in for an assessment, we look at as many variables as possible. Athletes are then given an appropriate program based on a variety of factors, including age, training and injury history, athlete goals, and current physical qualities. We decided to release this free six-week training block that fits a wide range of the needs previously listed.
Many of our programs are concurrent in nature. That means we train multiple qualities (hypertrophy, strength, and power) to some degree in every block. This six-week program focuses on gaining strength. But an athlete should also gain size and improve power output over its course.
Due to the training economy demands of these baseball workouts, it will likely be best suited for a pitcher in some type of velocity or high intent phase, or a hitter who is coming off an accumulation or hypertrophy block. For pitching and hitting, this phase will likely come about a quarter of the way into the off-season. Power and preseason phases would follow before the competition season begins.
With a sample size of 42, these are the average retest results of athletes that have completed this program:
While many other factors contribute to throwing harder or swinging the bat faster, training the physical qualities is certainly one piece of the puzzle. All of these metrics show at least moderate positive correlation with pitching velocity and bat speed.
We cannot guarantee improved velocity or bat speed, but we can say when athletes put work in the weight room, physical qualities improve.

Training Posture and Forward Bend with K-Vest - Driveline Baseball,2021-10-19T23:02:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/10/training-posture-and-forward-bend-with-k-vest/,"By John Soteropulos, Hitting Trainer
“I found out about Driveline from my friend John Soteropulos. We actually went to high school together at Loyola in Los Angeles. I knew I needed to do something different in my game to improve and become a better baseball player.” –  Angelo Armenta
It’s always exciting when a friend makes the trip up to Driveline. The sense of camaraderie becomes amplified, and the training floor environment heightens in energy and purpose even further.
When Angelo arrived, the first thing we did was take him through our hitting assessment.  Unsurprisingly, he already did a lot of things well – above average barrel consistency, solid bat speed, and good ball flight.
However, one of the biggest areas for improvement we identified was his posture, more specifically his torso forward bend. Angelo is a switch hitter, but this blog is going to highlight his left-handed swing. On the right is a video of Angelo’s assessment week. On the left is his exit week.
The main issue with Angelo’s swing was the excessive amount of torso forward bend (green line) he gained during his stride phase. We generally look for hitters to maintain a constant amount of forward bend during their stride phase, or gradually gain forward bend into heel strike. With Angelo, his torso forward bend was increasing from ≈20° at first move all the way to ≈50° at heel strike.
While some successful hitters are more bent over and exhibit greater degrees forward bend at heel strike (think Ricky Hendersons and Mo Vaughns of the world) anything above 40° is generally an area we flag for improvement.
Angelo’s first week K-Vest graph is below. Notice the green forward bend increasing while he strides. Below that is an example of an efficient upper body angles graph. Notice in the efficient example, the green forward bend line stays mostly parallel to the x-axis.
To visualize what this move looks like, take a look at Angelo’s K-vest animation. I recommend viewing this GIF at least twice. First time, watch only the animation. Second time, watch the “bend” measurement and notice how Angelo’s forward bend increases all the way up to 51°.
Up next, we have a screenshot from Angelo’s assessment K-vest report. The main takeaway here is that he was landing with anywhere between 45°-51° of forward bend.
Excessive forward bend can make it very difficult for hitters to produce flush contact on pitches up in the zone, especially if these pitches are fastballs with a lot of lift. Because elevated fastballs are being thrown more and more every year, it is important that we give our hitters a movement solution to combat this pitch.
In addition to high fastballs becoming more prevalent, pitchers are throwing harder and their pitches possess more movement. Because of this, we want to give our hitters a swing that can produce against higher velocity pitches, more severe movement profiles, and against pitches at various locations in the strike zone. For Angelo, this meant making an adjustment to his posture.
With the goal of getting Angelo more upright to improve his posture, the first drill we implemented during his swing design was the high tee inside pitch. The intent during this drill is to hit the ball hard to RF between 10-30° with backspin.
This drill helped set his posture for the high pitch and prevented him from landing with excessive forward bend. If he landed too bent over, his bat was forced to loop upwards to this pitch. This swing will produce a lot of topspin ground balls and high fly balls over 35°.
The next drill we implemented was the high inside fastball machine. This drill is a more advanced progression of the high tee. The intent is the same as the tee – hard line drives to RF between 10-30° with backspin – but the level of difficulty is much higher,  for a couple of reasons:
Here’s Angelo with a really good rep.
After he got a feel for the machine, we progressed to live arm batting practice. The idea here was to introduce variability, in the form of pitch location, and see how Angelo’s movements held up in a more randomized environment.
Our goal as trainers is to transfer these swing changes to the game, and live arm BP gets us one step closer to that.
In this next GIF, you can see how Angelo’s taller posture allows his bat path to square up a high and away pitch. His assessment data showed us when he hit the ball to the opposite field, his exit velocity decreased while his launch angle increased.
This is a lethal combo, but his new posture adjustments addressed this flaw. With his improved posture, Angelo was able to hit to the opposite field with a lower launch angle and higher exit velocity with swings like this.
As a side-note, one of Angelo’s favorite parts about training at Driveline was Shortbox Tuesdays. Shortbox is where employees take the mound and throw mixed pitch at-bats to our hitting trainees. It makes for quite a competitive training environment! Like my conversation with Aaron Takacs, I had to hear Angelo’s thoughts on who he thought had the best short box arsenal:
“Had to be Dan Comstock… John had weak stuff, with a changeup that floated over the plate like a beach ball”
When we compare his last week to his first week, Angelo made huge improvements with his swing posture. The green line in these graphs represents torso forward bend. Notice how from his first day to his last day, he has much less forward bend : 18°-28° versus 40°-50°.
Moreover, if you look at the shape of the forward bend curve from his recent swings, the green line stays parallel to the x-axis, meaning that he is striding and maintaining the same amount of bend. While on the right with his first week swings, the green line continually increases. This means he is continuing to gain forward bend while striding.
Angelo went from landing with 45°+ of forward bend to consistently landing with 20°-28°. This puts him in a much better position to cover pitches up in the zone as well as hit the ball flush the other way.
Finally, Angelo’s most recent K-vest animation helps us visualize these posture adjustments. Again, I recommend viewing this GIF twice. First time, watch only the animation. Second time, watch the “bend” measurement. You can see that now he lands much more upright, around 27°.
Comparing Edgertronic footage from his last day against his first day, we can really visualize the posture changes and how they affect his bat path. On the left, he strides with taller posture and maintains this bend up until heel strike and throughout the swing.
On the right, he gains forward bend while striding, and he lands very bent over at heel strike. This exaggerated posture causes his bat to loop through the zone with a higher attack angle. Because of his posture improvements, Angelo now has more swing depth, can do damage against the high fastball, all while maintaining his production on pitches low in the zone.
Below is a side by side of his swings on K-vest. On the last day he maintains taller posture, whereas on the first day he was landing much more bent over.
When it comes to training at Driveline, Angelo describes the athlete experience much better than I ever could:
“The best part about Driveline is you get objective data that shows some of your weaknesses you need to work on. The trainers use the data and develop a plan centered around making you a better baseball player and maximizing your time at the facility.”
Our mission at Driveline is to make you the best baseball player possible, and we use technology and objective data to significantly enhance this process. If you train at Driveline, we will make sure to answer this question, “What are you working to improve, and how are we going to get you there?” Make the best decision of your career 👇

Case Study: Making Point of Contact and Posture Adjustments - Driveline Baseball,2021-10-08T00:00:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/10/case-study-making-point-of-contact-and-posture-adjustments/,"By Andrew Cresci, Hitting Intern
After playing the majority of his youth baseball overseas in Japan and Australia, Connor came to Driveline this summer as he prepared to enter his first year of college baseball at DII Erskine College. Taking a look at Connor’s assessment swings and data, we got an idea of what areas he needed to improve in order to meet his goal of getting into the lineup on day one.
Connor’s Week 1 Big 3 Grades: Bat-to-Ball is Lacking
Looking through Connor’s assessment data, we found some keys areas to target:
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
Connor’s field and spray charts highlight his lack of hard contact and struggles pulling the ball in the air
Connor’s batted ball data highlighted three main issues:
While his swing metrics suggested an estimated top 8th EV (average of the top 12.5% of batted balls) of nearly 94 mph, his poor contact quality led to an actual top 8th of just 91 mph. This suggested the ceiling for his batted ball results was much higher and could be reached by improving his bat to ball skills and moving his average point of contact further out in front of home plate.
Connor’s Assessment Week K-Vest
Connor displayed poor sequencing of his body segments throughout his swing. Specifically, his inability to rotate his pelvis before other segments during the stride phase made it difficult for him to create sufficient space required to pull the baseball. This can be seen in both the avatar recreation above and in his efficiency chart below.. Notice how the pelvis, torso, and lead arm all reach peak rotational velocities at the same time. This does not allow for optimal transfer of momentum from segment to segment. Because Connor’s segments rotate at the same time, instead of in sequence one after the other, he is losing out on rotational velocity and potential bat speed. Basically, his poor rotational sequence was limiting how fast he can swing the bat.
Connor’s Assessment Week K-Vest Efficiency Graph – notice the lack of segment separation
Connor’s programming focused on:
Incentivising Connor to rotate his pelvis into foot plant was key to clearing space for him to pull the baseball effectively. Utilizing different implements such as the Long Bat and Handle-Load Speed Trainer, the goal was to build this skill through the constraints and with different implements (which has a positive impact on proprioception, your feel for the body in space as it moves) in order to promote proper sequencing and rotation.
(Initially, we had to aim tosses at Connor’s lead hip to get him to rotate. Later we were able to move them back to the inner third of the zone.)
The exaggerated angle from the pull-side forced Connor to rotate his pelvis and torso on time in order to create space to get his hands inside the baseball and pull it in the air with backspin. This adjustment promoted better sequencing of his body segments and created the efficient X-Factor stretch (hip-shoulder separation) he needed to increase rotational power potential.
Hitting Plyo Ball ® offer immediate contact quality feedback, and for a player working on bat-to-ball skills, these are the perfect tool. Plyo Ball ®-oriented training was mixed in throughout Connor’s programming, as well as 2-3 smash factor-specific days during the week. During these smash factor focused sessions, he hit both regular and mini hitting Plyo Ball ®, sometimes with skinny bats, in order to make the tasks more difficult. Learn more on how we use hitting Plyo Ball ®, or weighted hitting balls, to train a players bat path.
Connor loved the addition of med ball work to his hitting programming. The goal in teaching any athlete to rotate is to create a feel and foundation for them to move—and move quickly.
Utilizing the rope med ball worked on two areas of focus: point of contact and connection/posture. Using this in tandem with our offset drills allowed Connor to incorporate various points of focus while also maximizing training economy.
Ball flight intentions provided Connor with the correct external focus to shape the positive movement adaptations he sought through self organization. This idea was central in every drill he did, as we looked to alter previously established movement patterns in order to reach his training goals.
Connor’s Before and After “Big 3 Grade” Increases
Bat-to-Ball: Connor made huge improvements to his bat to ball skills, moving his in-gym grade from a below average score of 89 to 103 (+14 points). This massive jump increased the amount of flush contact he made, while also allowing him to get greater value out of mishits.
Swing Decisions: As with most hitters with an extremely deep point of contact, Connor’s swing decisions were initially above average, as the longer a hitter lets the ball travel, the better they will be at discerning pitch type and location. Connor managed to move his average point of contact further out (16.8” to 20.8”) and not only maintained, but improved upon his swing decision grade.
Top 8th EV: Connor improved his top 8th exit velocity from a below average 91 mph to 97.9 mph (a gain of 6.9 mph). His max EV also made a significant jump by over 10 mph from 92.69 to 103.27 mph. These improvements were a testament to his gains in bat-to-ball as well as swing decisions, raising the value of his batted balls and allowing him to showcase his power potential.
His ability to pull the ball in the air dramatically increased as well, as his average distance increased by nearly 131 feet (75.8 to 206.7) and exceeded our pro averages
.
Hard Contact – 0% → Hard Contact – 22%Medium Contact – 84% → Medium Contact – 69% Soft Contact – 16% → Soft Contact – 9%
Max EV92.69 → 103.27 = + 10.58 mphTop 8th EV 91 → 97.9 = + 6.9 mphAvg. EV81.5 → 86.9 = + 5.4 mph
Hard Hit POC17.7 → 22.7 = + 5 inchesAvg. POC 16.8 → 20.8 = + 4 inches
At his arrival, Connor’s swing highlighted a “pushy” bat path due to the insufficient separation and rotation of his pelvis, often forcing his hands to pull across his body. 8 weeks later, his ability to rotate and efficiently transfer energy was vastly improved, highlighted by his final week exit velocity PR of 103.27 MPH. As seen in his wOBACON (wOBA on contact) zone improvements below, Connor saw an average increase of 54% across the board, while vastly exceeding our collegiate averages. His improvements in sequencing his body as well as his bat-to-ball skills dramatically improved his batted ball results.

love this article I only have 1 point that I think needs clarification, “Incentivising Connor to rotate his pelvis into foot plant”?
Shouldn’t this be rotate the front hip into foot plant? The tweet you reference of Bonds is great and he does not rotate the pelvis at foot plant, he rotates the front hip.

High Performance: 2021 College Summer Recap - Driveline Baseball,2021-09-27T23:08:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/high-performance-2021-college-summer-recap/,"By Brice Crider, High Performance
This summer, the High Performance Staff ran 617 strength assessments with 182 of those being with athletes that trained for at least 6 weeks and retested within 2 weeks of completing a program. The average overall score went from a 53 to a 60, a 13.2% gain, over the course of a 6 week training block.
High Performance Gains by Phase
When viewing high performance gains grouped by lifting phase, it is important to keep in mind that the programs within these phases are largely concurrent—which means that all general qualities (hypertrophy, strength, power, speed, reactive strength) are being trained to some extent throughout each program. The name of the phase merely indicates which quality is the focus. An easy metaphor to understand this is a series of dimmer switches. As the focus changes from phase to phase, the ratios of training stimuli change as well. For an athlete who is able to train for a full summer (18 weeks, 3 phases), the typical progression is accumulation, strength, then power.
Accumulation
Accumulation phases (focused on hypertrophy and building work capacity) are where we saw our largest average gains in our six key metrics. This is largely due to the fact that a summer athlete who is put into an accumulation phase is typically physically underdeveloped and will reap the largest benefit from increasing muscle mass and general work capacity, as they are further away from their genetic ceiling. During an accumulation phase, athletes are usually in an on-ramp throwing phase. This is important to note because it allows us to allocate more of their training economy into the weight room, which we would expect to yield larger gains in our high performance retest metrics.
Strength
The majority of athletes in college summer go directly into strength phases, as not every athlete can spend the full 18 weeks at Driveline for the full progression. Typically, athletes that arrive prepared for a velocity throwing phase will not go into an accumulation phase in the weight room, as we generally do not pair the high volumes of accumulation with the high acute stressors of a velocity phase.
Strength phases tend to be lower in overall volume, allowing athletes to push intensity in order to make gains in absolute strength, measured by the Isometric Mid Thigh Pull.
Power
Power phases have the least amount of participants during college summer, due to the fact that many athletes are only in the gym long enough for one phase and typically go into a strength phase. The athletes that do go straight into a power phase generally have a larger training history and are more adapted than their counterparts.
These athletes usually have already built a solid foundation of size and strength, and now need to make more specific power gains. Because they are already so adapted and closer to their genetic ceiling, making further gains becomes more and more difficult. Another important consideration is that during power phases, athletes are typically in velocity or pre-competition phases on the throwing side, so there is less training economy for weight room gains. Power is tested in the Squat Jump and Countermovement Jump.
Changes in Predicted and Actual Velocity
One of the best ways to contextualize improvements in general physical qualities is using our Predicted Velocity Calculator. This tool not only allows for communication with the athlete on how these gains can affect velocity but can also provide context to why an athlete may (or may not) have made a velocity jump during the course of a block.
The average athlete at Driveline this summer gained 1.40 mph in predicted velocity per 6-week strength phase, while in reality, they gained 2.10 mph of actual velocity from mocap test to retest. Although it is impossible to say for sure, a likely explanation for the difference between predicted and actual velocity in such a large data set is that movement changes and skill acquisition on the throwing side positively affected the athlete’s velocity as well.
Unsurprisingly, the phase patterns of predicted and actual velo are opposite. Athletes made the largest predicted velocity gains in accumulation phases (when weight room volume is the highest and throwing intensity is usually low) and made the largest actual velocity gains in power phases (when weight room volume is low, and athletes are usually in a velocity phase).

Pitching Training Velocity Results 2019-2020 - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-18T00:12:44+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/pitching-training-velocity-results-2019-2020/,"In the past, we have discussed some of the KPIs and metrics the Driveline hitting department uses to both quantify athlete results and measure trainer performance. In the pitching department, we focus specifically on a handful of metrics, all of which we will discuss in forthcoming blog posts.
When determining which metrics to prioritize, we wanted to make sure that tracking and reporting these internally would help us assess whether our current training strategies and protocols were working while ALSO helping us evaluate the individual performances of our skill coaches. We hold each member of the department and ultimately the entire company accountable for these results.
Do athletes get better? How good are our skill coaches? Are we improving all aspects of pitching development? This is what matters to us.
For now, we will focus on one thing: velocity. We know that velocity is one of the most important metrics in pitching. Previously, we have discussed how much value can be created by developing it at the minor league level. In addition, while it’s been a while since we did after-the-fact analyses of athlete results (2018 summer edition), as we gear up for the 2021 summer, we wanted to introduce a few from the last couple years.
This piece is strictly about how much fastball velocity was gained by pitchers who assessed, trained, and retested (at least once) at Driveline from roughly summer 2019 on. Of course, fastball velocity is not the be-all-end-all of player development, nor is it a focus for every single pitcher that walks through the doors at Driveline.
Nevertheless, it is an extremely important indicator of success at the major league level. To quote our past research on velocity’s impact on production: “A [MLB] pitcher who outperformed his fastball velocity projection [from 2013 to 2019] by +1 mph produced an RA9 that was .2443 points lower than expected, on average.”
Or, more simply, gaining fastball velo has an extreme impact on an athlete’s performance ceiling, so we take great care in monitoring it.
Given the variety of focuses of of our in-gym athletes, we standardize pitching floor velocity gains as a KPI using the velocities from our motion capture assessment. All athletes throw in the mocap lab on Day 1 (or when they are otherwise reasonably healthy and on-boarded up to game speed).
For retest purposes, we’ll generally retest players every 6 weeks (+/- a week or two) to assess mechanical changes and obtain a consistent measure of their throwing velocity.  Thus, the numbers below reflect athletes who have trained here for at least 1 such training block, which we feel allows enough time—given the nonlinear nature of gains—to capture notable changes without the day to day variation that is natural in the course of training.
We’ll look at some general stats to get started.
The chart below shows statistics for the athletes who’ve trained at Driveline over the past two years. We see that the average starting velocity and velocity gained while training at DL both climb from 2019 to 2020 (offseason and summer training periods). This off-season, the average stay for athletes was longer, which can likely be credited to an increase in long-term trainees related to flexibility and uncertainty around COVID.
Similarly, with the facility shut down for the first half of the 2020 summer, no athletes were able to get in two training blocks before summer ended.
Looking more specifically at the distribution of velocity gains by seasonal training block rather than over the athlete’s entire stay, we see those increases from 2019 to 2020 remain consistent.
The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile velocity gains (the dark orange vertical lines in the graphs above) are also indicated below.
Returning to velocity gains accrued during an athlete’s stay, the chart below groups athletes into mph increments and shows the number and overall percentage of athletes who fall into each increment.
Among athletes with at least one training block at Driveline, 52% gained more than 1 mph in their retest, 27% maintained about the same velo (+/- 1 mph), and 21% lost velocity in the last mocap retest of their stay.
We see that athletes who train at the facility for longer gain more velocity—on average—than those who stay for shorter periods of time.
Another notable trend that we’ve observed in the past and which holds true in this sample of athletes is that it’s generally tougher to gain velocity for hard throwers. This is due to a variety of factors, including the relative lack of low hanging fruit to address mechanically or physically, along with the fact that harder throwers may be more focused on other areas of development, such as pitch design, command, or simply getting game-like reps to prepare for the season.
A number of athletes have trained with us across multiple trips to the gym, often including online training in-between to continue working towards their goals.
To include the progress of these athletes over a longer time period, we can also compare all athletes’ first mocap on file (in this case since April 2019) with their most recent mocap.
The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are again marked with dark orange lines and are shown in the table below—with athletes gaining 1.8 mph on average (mean gain).
As above, we can gain a bit more insight by also considering how long athletes had between their first and last mocaps.
We see athletes with a longer Driveline training history on average had greater gains across each of the buckets. For the 35 athletes who have trained with us over the course of several off-seasons or over a full gap year (more than 200 days between their first and last mocaps), we see average velo gains of 3.29 mph.
As referenced above, we see it’s more difficult for athletes to gain more velocity the harder they start off throwing. Even so, athletes who throw moderately hard are able to gain velocity on average (though these gains are naturally smaller than for athletes who start off throwing slower) over the long term.
Training for velocity is possible. We prove that here every single day and hold ourselves accountable, monitoring velocity gains as one of our Pitching Department’s main KPIs.  If you want to throw harder, this is the best place in the world to help you do that.
All that said, we know that velocity is not the only thing that matters with regards to being a successful pitcher and getting hitters out. Because of that, it is not the only thing the pitching department at Driveline focuses on when training athletes, and it is not the only KPI we use to evaluate our proficiency at improving performance.
In future posts, we will discuss our pitch design KPIs, Athlete Composite Scores, MPH per Varus tracking and how we quantify the athlete’s overall training experience.

How a high school sophomore gained strength and improved bat speed,2021-05-27T01:37:48+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/how-a-high-school-sophomore-improved/,"The idea of lifting for a high school athlete is usually an afterthought, even though it is often one of the most crucial parts of their development. Emmett Weichbrodt saw the benefits of starting a structured development plan early, hitting six days a week and lifting 3 days a week at Driveline.
Weichbrodt came to the gym in late November, showing above-average strength and power for the high school level in his initial strength assessment. Starting in an already impressive place for a high schooler, now after his most recent assessment, he’s going into his sophomore baseball season with the metrics that match an above average college baseball player based on in-gym averages.
Train at Driveline
We started him on a relatively high-volume strength program to build a foundation of work capacity and to attack the lowest hanging fruit for a young high school athlete. This gave him the stimulus needed to for gaining strength and lean mass. After building a solid foundation of strength and volume, we moved Emmett through two phases with reduced volume, progressing from strength to power focus.
Before we get into the specific numbers, the graphs you will see below have white and red lines. The white lines represent in-gym averages for each metric. The red lines are one standard deviation above and below the mean. For comparison purposes, we are putting this athlete into the college athlete category so the norms shown are for in-gym college athletes.
Lift consistently and eat in a caloric surplus is simple and yet it’s incredibly effective.
We watched Emmett go from weighing 174.6 on November 25th to weighing 192.5 during his last retest on April 7 before he started his season. That 18-pound increase is a reflection of this athlete’s dedication and commitment to his craft.
We measure athletes’ absolute strength using an Isometric Mid-thigh Pull on force plates which allows us to see how much force the athlete is capable of putting into the ground. Weichbrodt pulled 2698 N in his initial assessment, which is slightly above the high school average at 2614.8 N.
In late February, Emmett pulled 3624 N—which is not only above average for what we see in our college athletes but also slightly above the average we see from our minor league athletes at 3434.8 N. During his latest retest, we saw a slight drop in his absolute strength, which is not ideal but can be somewhat expected after a power-focused block of training.
The next portion of the strength assessment we use our countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) to measure lower body power. The graphs below show Emmett’s results and how they compare to the college athletes we’ve tested in the gym.
In-gym averages for college athletes performing the CMJ and SJ are 41.2 cm and 36.7 respectively. Emmett’s CMJ went from 33.5 cm in late November to early 42.3 cm in early April. His SJ went from 31.8 cm in November to 36.8 cm in April. We also saw a corresponding significant increase in his peak power for both jump types.
The last test in our assessment is the repetitive hop test (RHS) which gives us athletes their respective reactive strength index (RSI) which approximates elasticity and stiffness by dividing the flight time of the jumps by their ground contact time. The in-gym college average for our RSI test is 2.5. When Emmett first got to Driveline his initial RSI test he scored a 2.2, which has since increased to 2.9
The graph below gives perspective to the importance of strength and power in generating bat speed and velocity. The graph represents IMTP net peak force and SJ peak power. Emmett started in the bottom left quadrant of the graph (low force and low power). Ideally, we would like him to progress to the top right quadrant (high force and high power), where the average bat speed is 73.1 for in gym college athletes.
Right now, Emmett is sitting in the top left quadrant (high force, low power) and the average bat speed is 68.6. Emmett’s name is above the dots on the graph and gives you an idea of how close he is to the top right quadrant. Remember, this is a sophomore in high school being compared to college athletes. In most cases, the stronger and more powerful athletes get the faster their bat speed gets.
Each of the dots on the graph represents an athlete and where they fall on the bell curves of strength and power. As we go from bottom left to top right, we generally see the dots turn from blue to red. The blue dots represent athletes that have below seventy miles per hour (MPH) bat speed and the red dots represent athletes that have seventy-five MPH and up on bat speed. As you can see, Emmett has seen steady improvements in strength and power since he first got here, and is climbing up into the top right quadrant of this graph.
For more information about our driveline high performance assessment, check out this blog and subsequent blogs going in-depth about all the tests, how they are performed, and why we use these tests to assess athletes.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
When we look at the hitting side of things, Emmett’s hard work in the weight room paid huge dividends towards his development as a hitter.
Below is a rolling graph of Emmett’s average bat speed during his six months at Driveline – November to April. The solid middle line is his rolling average, and the dotted lines above and below are the standard deviation bounds. What we see here is a pretty steady increase the entire time—ideal…to say the least!
When we compare his average bat speed during his assessment week (64.23mph) against the average from his last two weeks at Driveline (67.17mph), Emmett saw an increase of +2.94mph on his average bat speed, quite the improvement!
His dedication to the weight room and his consistency in the cages paved the way for Emmett to make some huge gains.
When we evaluate exit velocity, our go-to metric is top 8th exit velocity, which is the mean of a hitter’s top 12.5% hardest-hit balls. Comparing his assessment week to his last month in-gym, Emmett added +6.79 mph to his top 8th exit velocity!
With the strength and hitting improvements he made at Driveline, we are very excited to follow along with Emmett as he tears it up during his spring and summer seasons!
Check out how hitting Plyo Ball ®, or weighted hitting balls, can help hitters train bat speed and exit velocity.

Robbie Tenerowicz: The Swing Transformation of a Reds Minor Leaguer - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-11T00:50:44+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/robbie-tenerowicz-the-swing-transformation-of-a-reds-minor-leaguer/,"After his third season of professional baseball, Robbie “Byrd” Tenerowicz knew he needed something. Something that would take his game to the next level, give him the tools he needed to compete and perform with the best athletes in the world, and ultimately accomplish his dream of making the big leagues.
Byrd arrived at Driveline in October of 2019. We did with Byrd what we do with any hitter that comes through the doors of Driveline — we took him through our world-class hitting assessment.
After the assessment, the main areas of improvement we identified for Byrd were his:
Fast forward to March 2021, after 18 months of training, and his swing looks like this now
Pretty big difference right? Check out these data gains too:
He swings the bat faster, hits the ball harder, and produces more batted balls in optimal launch angles. All of these are desirable traits for being good at baseball. Let’s hit the rewind button for a second and dive into how Byrd made these changes.
**Side-by-side before and after video can be viewed with this link
We’ll start with his bat sensor data. The main metrics we are looking at with Byrd are his average bat speed, average attack angle, and peak bat speed.
Although Byrd was an above-average performer during his time in the minor leagues, the lowest hanging fruit for him was definitely improving bat speed and adding loft to his bat path. For training bat speed, we utilized a lot of concentrated bat speed training/programming with the Axe Bat Speed Trainers.
We addressed his low attack angle by fixing some posture issues he had in his mechanics (see K-Vest section). The results for both his bat speed and attack angle were outstanding.
Byrd’s increase in bat speed has given him the ability to hit the ball harder than he did before, and raising his attack angle from 4° →  15° allows him to hit for more power than he has in previous seasons.
*Note on attack angle. Although Byrd needed to make attack angle adjustments and raise his average attack angle, 15° is likely a little high in comparison to where he would live in the game. In the context of a training environment, (where we are occasionally solely focusing on bat speed or optimal ball flight) attack angles are typically higher than what we see in a live-at-bat setting. I would expect his in-game attack angle to live anywhere between the 8°-12° range.
Now let’s take a look at Byrd’s batted ball data from his assessment week. The main metrics we’re looking at here are peak exit velocity, average launch angle of hard-hit balls, and average exit velocity. What we saw with Byrd was a hitter who did not hit the ball hard enough, and when he did hit the ball hard, he’d hit it at a ground ball trajectory, which is not ideal for success.
However, when we look at Byrd’s recent batted ball data, he’s made substantial progress in all of the targeted areas.
His batted ball changes are highlighted by improvements to the following metrics:
By executing a bat speed program and making a slight adjustment to his swing plane, Byrd improved the quality of his batted balls. His increased bat speed led to a substantial increase in peak and average exit velocity. Raising his attack angle from  4° → 15° makes it possible for him to elevate his average launch angle of hard-hit balls. More exit velocity + line drive ball flight = productive batted balls.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
When Byrd came to Driveline in September 2019, his K-Vest graphs revealed posture issues that were making it difficult for him to hit the ball hard and in the air consistently. The K-Vest metrics we addressed in his swing were:
In order to fix these issues, we laid out a detailed plan of attack that is best summarized by clipping one of the training log entries we wrote for him in October 2019.
What we are looking for in the upper body graph above, is equal values of torso forward bend, side bend, and rotation and side bend at contact will be greater than or equal to forward bend at first move (equal on a pitch at the top of the zone and greater than for pitches lower). So, if you have very little torso forward bend as you begin to rotate towards the ball, it is unlikely you will create enough side bend to rotate on plane with pitches lower in the zone. Below is an example of an efficient upper body graph for reference.
On your good swings, you do not lose as much forward bend, and instead, you replace forward bend with side bend at contact. For you, we are looking to add a little more forward bend at first move and more side bend at contact. This will help you hit the low pitch flush with more elevation.
You demonstrate very little forward torso bend while maintaining a significantly higher value of anterior tilt of the pelvis. This means you are arching your low back to load yourself rather than rotating the pelvis. Low values of torso bend can be associated with standing very tall at the plate and a lack of hip hinge. This is important to your swing for multiple reasons.
The information on your swing mechanics and batted ball profile is meant to provide context and awareness to issues, but executing this plan will be all about intention and developing a routine to sustain these changes to your body and mindset.
A few visuals:
Suarez at roughly the same point in the swing. More side bend of the torso and pelvis, creating more loft in his bat path deeper in the zone in comparison to your bat still having to travel quite a bit further before the upswing starts.
Correa creating loft in little earlier in his swing with shoulders rotating more underneath each other. This is a product of added forward bend and maintaining spine angle throughout the swing. Check out some of the ways we use hitting Plyo Ball ® to change bat path.
Byrd’s previously mentioned swing flaws are best visualized by looking at some of his swings from the minor leagues. Homerun? Yes. Good swing? Kind of, but not really.
Hit the fast forward button, and below are some of his swings from training. In these swings, there is noticeably more torso forward bend at heel strike, and he maintains his posture – replaces forward bend with side bend – much better than he did before. You’ll also notice his bat path improvements. With his increased attack angle, he’s now able to create loft with his swing on pitches down zone, and his improved swing depth gives him a larger point of contact range to make flush contact.
The mechanical improvements become even more prominent when looking at pitches on the inner half of the plate.
Lastly, a couple of side-by-side comparisons illustrate these mechanical improvements even further.
Comparing the recent swing on the left versus an assessment swing on the right. We can see noticeably more hip flexion and torso forward bend than the swing on the right. This is also evident in the K-Vest performance graphs (see pictures at beginning of the section).
In this visual, we can see noticeably more forward bend and side bend of the torso in the swing on the left which allows for a deeper entry into the zone and an ability to adjust to the pitch with posture rather than just throwing his hands at the ball.
Train at Driveline
Re-tooled, revamped, and rejuvenated, Byrd made his way down to spring training 2020 with the Tampa Bay Rays. However, after just three weeks, spring training was cancelled because of Covid-19. Pretty tough blow for a guy who was ready to roll. Nonetheless, Byrd returned to Washington to continue what he’d started. After being back for a little less than a month, Byrd got a phone call from the Rays letting him know that he’d been released. Boom, that one hurts. Another tough blow, but definitely not enough to stop Byrd from continuing to get better. With Driveline closed because of Covid, we got back to work outside. Even with an uncertain future, Byrd continued to improve and re-tool his swing every single day.
When Driveline re-opened at the end of the 2020 summer, Byrd’s swing, approach, and mindset were in as good of a place as they’d ever been. He continued his development, and the Reds took notice and signed him to a minor league contract. With a place to play and a new swing, a lot of the training leading up until spring training was geared towards maintaining and challenging his new patterns and approach. This meant hitting in fast-paced and game representative environments. For an example of what this looks like, here is a clip from a fastball training session, where we had the machine set at 95mph, 12:30 spin axis, and 2500 rpm.
The idea here was that we wanted to stress test Byrd’s new swing and make his new changes even more “sticky” for when spring training, and ultimately the season, rolled around. One of Byrd’s most memorable training highlights came when he finally accomplished his goal of hitting a ball over 110 mph.
If this doesn’t fire you up…make sure you check your Motus. He’s since hit a ball 111.1 mph, but the first one over 110mph always hits a little bit different. After 18 months of training at Driveline, we finally uncaged the Byrd and sent him off to spring training, where he could spread his wings and fly…
…and fly he did!
Reds minor leaguer Robbie Tenerowicz only takes absolute 𝐃𝐀𝐃𝐃𝐘 𝐇𝐀𝐂𝐊𝐒. 🏋️‍♂️@ByrdHotTakes pic.twitter.com/rCn4N8huuj
After a successful Spring Training, Byrd has started the 2021 season with the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts. Safe to say, all of us here at Driveline are very excited to watch him perform this year!
For some closing remarks, I’d like to reconstruct Byrd’s training timeline:
That’s 18 months of training without playing a competitive baseball game…18 months! Byrd is proof that baseball players can be developed if they expose themselves to the right training/information and put in the work every single day. Action expresses priorities, and if you want something bad enough, your actions will follow suit.

Case Study: How Kaleb Roper Used Online Training to Revamp His Fastball - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-05T01:01:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/case-study-how-kaleb-roper-used-online-training-to-revamp-his-fastball/,"In October 2019, Kaleb Roper was coming off his first year in pro ball with the White Sox. excited about what 2020 had in store before COVID-19 seemingly shut down the world in an instant. In a sudden turn of events, Roper needed a new plan. After training all summer and throwing well during instructs, he reached out to Driveline to begin his remote training program.
Roper, a right-handed pitcher, was drafted in the 29th round of the 2019 MLB Draft out of Tulane University. He spent 2019 in the Rookie League, where his fastball sat between 91-94 mph and topped at 95 mph. Coming out of instructs in 2020, Roper was throwing more in the 90-93 mph range, occasionally reaching 94 mph. His fastball has an elite movement profile, averaging nearly 20 inches of lift.
Roper signed up for Driveline online pitching training so he could spend time at home with family but still get world-class pitching training to continue his development.
We used the first six weeks to act as an on-ramp and reload period before getting into high intensity throwing. As a fully remote athlete, access to a biomechanics report or strength assessment was not possible, so during the on-ramp period, we had Roper go through an active movement screen testing for inefficient movements and instability. Pairing this with constant video feedback of the prescribed Plyo Ball ® drills and game film from 2019 and instructs of 2020, we built the baseline that would drive the decisions to make mechanical improvements in his delivery.
In the movement screen, we discovered Roper lacked single-leg stability and struggled controlling posture during various lower body movements, so we prescribed targeted warm up exercises he would do daily to increase stability and body control. On the throwing side, with his arm action we noticed that he tended to have slight “elbow climb” or high shoulder abduction between foot plant and ball release. With his lower body, the timing of his lead leg block was slightly late. This was a result of his pelvis being swung open with his lead leg, rather than driven open with his back leg.
The first six weeks of the remote program we focused on how “the system” of the throw works. This coincided with discussions over proper movement and mechanics, as the throwing intensity was low and the goal was to build back throwing fitness with the newly implemented throwing schedule. We wanted to make sure he was doing the drills properly, rather than just doing the drills just to do the drills.
The best example of this was attacking the high elbow climb in pivot pickoffs. There was not a specific cue given, rather a continual conversation about what it should look like, athlete education, and discussion of “feels” that seemed to accelerate the process of having a cleaner arm path.
The lower half discussion was a bit more technical and cue-filled. Since Roper would use his lead leg to initiate rotation of the pelvis, the plan of attack was to keep his pelvis closed longer so the back leg could do its job and initiate rotation. The two cues that were decided on were: hold the belt buckle towards the short stop, and keep the hips in line with a right-handed batter. The goal was to create and maintain tension in the rear hip longer than what he was doing at the time.
The on-ramp lasted into the first week of January 2020. After the on-ramp, we used the next three weeks to push high output throwing. Our goal was back-to-back 5 oz. pulldowns at 100 mph before shifting the focus to the mound. This phase would normally be longer given a full off-season (4-6 weeks), but because of unknown time constraints, we made the decision to better focus the remaining time we had making sure the on-ramp and pulldown work would translate to increased velocities on the mound.
The last weekend of January marked Roper’s first high-output day on the mound. We used the next five weeks to continue maximizing velocity once a week. We used the video and velocity from high-intent days to monitor week-by-week changes and set a goal for the following week. Going into March, Roper was already throwing at or above his 2020 instruct velocities in bullpens and was nearing his top fastball velocity of 95 mph from 2019. At this point, we knew there was roughly a month before he would have to report for spring training, so we increased the frequency of high-output days to twice a week to prepare for the spring training throwing schedule.
The month of March consisted of a 90-percent bullpen on Tuesdays, sitting in the 88-92 mph range, with the option to let no more than three fastballs go at the end, and a 100 percent bullpen on Fridays for the first two weeks. The goal was to make sure the increased frequency in high-intent throwing did not impact his ability to reach top end velocities on the Fridays before moving into a live-at bat setting. By the end of the offseason, Roper’s bullpen and live-at bat fastball velocities were all above his 2019 average and max.
Using Trackman data from two live sessions, we can see how the increased velocity improved the quality of the fastball in comparison to big league averages, using our “Blob” tool. The chart below shows how the fastball has not only improved since 2019—but since Roper left instructs. Over a similar sample size, the average velocity climbed, and Roper has been above his 2019 peak of 95.1 mph in each outing in 2021.We’re excited to see what Roper does this MiLB season.

What is a Driveline Hitting Assessment? - Driveline Baseball,2021-04-16T00:29:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/04/driveline-hitting-assessment/,"There’s a hitter in you. One that can hit the ball harder, launch the ball further, and swing the bat faster. The truth is, this player exists in every single one of us, it’s just a matter of tapping into that potential with the right training.  Driveline is designed for the committed player who understands that improvement and refinement of their skill will come as a result of their relentless hard work. Sound like you? The foundation of our coaching is the hitting assessment, which includes data collection and analysis using various baseball technologies.
What exactly does that mean? It means we use technology to learn more about every single area of your swing.
Our mission at Driveline is to make you the best baseball player possible, and technology significantly enhances this process.  These innovative tools are very powerful because we don’t have to guess anymore.  When we tell you something, we have data to back it up. With that said, what kind of data do we collect during the hitting assessment?
Train at Driveline
So, once we accumulate all of this data, what do we do with it? Enter Driveline Hitting Trainers. When it comes to data, the application of this information is what truly matters. I repeat, the application of this information is what truly matters.
At the end of every hitting assessment, hitters sit down with a trainer and review their reports: batted ball, Blast, motion capture, K-vest, bat-to-ball, and swing decisions. But wait, that’s too many reports, how do you guys prevent data overload? Great question, and one that all Driveline trainers are very well equipped to answer. Trainers streamline information that is most relevant to you. We refer to this as identifying the “low hanging fruit.”
Training plans are designed to attack your most immediate deficiencies as well as accomplish longer term goals. Our main objective during the athlete meeting is to answer this question “What are you working to improve, and how are we going to get you there?” Using this information and date from the hitting assessment, trainers create objective goals for each athlete.
We’ve created goals and developed a training plan to accomplish them. The next step is going to work in the cage! Swing Designs are one-on-one hitting sessions where trainers outline a plan and select drills focused on improving your deficiencies.
These sessions are invaluable for the athlete because trainers explain the “why” behind specific drills.  We view swing designs as an action plan to connect the dots for every athlete and create their training plan and programming going forward.
Swing designs develop a clear roadmap for your development, but most importantly they prepare you to do damage every time you step into the batter’s box.
The previous portion of this blog was meant to be a brief overview of the hitting assessment. These following sections dive into much more detail about each individual topic.
Train at Driveline
The primary purpose of a hitting assessment week is to collect various forms of data and derive a baseline level of performance for every athlete. Areas we will collect data on during the hitting assessment week include: Batted Ball Data, Bat Sensor Metrics, Swing Biomechanics, Bat-to-Ball Skills, Swing Decisions, Edgertronic Camera Footage. Data collection on every aspect of a hitter’s swing is integral to the assessment process. While all of that data may seem a little daunting at first, don’t worry! Our hitting trainers are very skilled at “translating the data” for every athlete. If you were curious about what the first week looks like, below is a day-by-day breakdown of the hitting assessment process.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
A hitter’s batted ball data is one of the most useful and applicable forms of data we can collect.  It reveals a lot about a hitters’ current talent level and is very descriptive of how a hitter’s bat is moving through the zone. Using Hittrax and Rapsodo, we can answer questions like:
Answers to these questions are invaluable tools for trainers to create programming, develop an athlete’s approach, and make swing adjustments. Additionally, we create batted ball reports for every in-gym athlete. Some of the key performance indicators we evaluate are:
We’ll also evaluate other aspects of your swing such as where you make contact in the zone
How you are hitting the ball in specific launch angle ranges.
Lastly, what does your contact look like to every area of the field  (-45 = left field foul pole and 45 = right field foul pole)
Batted ball data builds the framework for objective goal setting. As trainers we can say stuff like “During your first week at Driveline your top 8th exit velocity was 94 mph, in 6 weeks your goal is to increase this to 97 mph” or “Your average launch angle of hard hit balls is -2°. This means that the hardest balls you hit are on the ground, and you’re missing out on possible production. In 6 weeks, your goal is to increase your average launch angle of hard hit balls to 10°.” Trainers then create a program designed to accomplish these goals. All of this guarantees you will step into the cage with a plan, every single day.
The manner in which an athlete’s bat moves through space is largely predictive of what his/her batted ball data will look like. Because a hitter has control over how he/she is swinging the bat, blast metrics tend to stabilize very quickly, making them essential feedback for creating/evaluating training programs. At Driveline, we use Blast Motion to collect the following:
Additionally, we will use metrics such as early connection and plane efficiency to learn more about how a hitter’s bat is moving. While not as predictive as metrics like bat speed and attack angle are, we find that using a healthy combination of all the Blast metrics tends to yield the best results!
When it comes to biomechanics, the tools we use for data collection are Driveline’s world-class motion capture lab and the K-Vest. Both of these tools provide precise measurements for the kinematics and kinetics of an athlete’s swing. Some examples of what trainers will analyze are: kinematic sequencing, rotational velocities, specific joint angles, and posture throughout the swing. Armed with this information, we can be much more precise with our drill prescriptions. Biomechanics removes the guesswork, streamlines training, and gives hitters a definitive plan for improving their swing.
We quantify a hitter’s bat-to-ball skills using a metric called Smash Factor. Smash Factor measures the collision efficiency of the bat and ball at contact, in essence telling us how much of a swing’s bat speed was converted into exit velocity.
By considering both bat speed and exit velocity, smash factor gives unique insight into how well a player puts their strength and raw tools to use. Smash Factor reaches reliability very quickly (≈20 BIP) and is easy to apply and analyze in Driveline’s training environment. Because it assigns whiffs and fouls a smash factor of 0, taking a player’s average describes both how often and how well they make contact.
We use launch monitors like HitTrax and Rapsodo combined with in-house contact and result tracking tools to calculate and monitor players’ smash factor while they hit in game representative environments. Having access to rolling smash factor grades for our athletes is an extremely useful tool to evaluate performance and adjust programming.
Using the same methodology as smash factor with our in-house contact and result tracking tools, we generate a swing decision grade for every athlete. Oftentimes, before making a mechanical change with an athlete, we make sure to ask the question  “What pitch did he just swing at?”  Quantifying what pitches an athlete swings at helps to evaluate his performance with more context and make training adjustments accordingly.
Using the Edgertronic camera, we film your swing at up to 2000 frames per second. This super slo-mo camera is a valuable tool for analyzing your swing and bat path. Cross-referencing mocap/K-vest data with Edgertronic footage allows us to visualize mechanics and examine your swing kinematics in even greater detail.
Every hitter will go through a strength assessment during their first week at Driveline. Our strength assessment tests a wide range of general strength properties using a dual force plate system from ForceDecks. If you are curious about the intricacies of the strength assessment, reading this blog post is a great place to start!
Strength training for athletes follows a similar test and retest structure. Athletes will assess during their first week in the gym and then retest once every six weeks. Six-week blocks allow HP staff to track athlete progress while advancing their programming and not using so much training economy whereas to significantly interfere with hitting and throwing programs.
On the second day of their hitting assessment week, every athlete will see our on-site physical therapist, Dr. Terry Phillips for an initial screening. After the first week, athletes will check-in with Terry on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Scheduled visits allow Terry to work his magic and ensure you feel ready to go for daily training. At Driveline, our motto is to “minimize the amount of time our athletes do not feel 100%” and Terry plays an integral role in making this possible.

Driveline Becomes West Coast League’s Official Player Development Partner - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-31T18:11:59+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/driveline-becomes-west-coast-leagues-official-player-development-partner/,"The West Coast League and Driveline Baseball are proud to announce a strategic partnership combining player development and playing experience.
Driveline Baseball becomes an “Official Player Development Partner of the West Coast League”, and will bring its analytical expertise, training resources, and education tools to coaches and players through various outlets.
The West Coast League’s 15 teams, ranging from Alberta and British Columbia down through Washington and Oregon, will be able to access educational resources and programming tools that are available through Driveline’s coaching certifications and Driveline’s programming software, TRAQ, which allows coaches to evaluate performance in ways beyond the box score. They can source this information to the players in order to boost their performance on the field.
An example of this includes the use of Driveline’s Pitch Charts reporting tool in TRAQ as well as additional TRAQ reports. Twelve of the fifteen teams in the West Coast League currently have a Trackman unit, and all teams are expected to have a unit by 2022. Trackman measures pitching metrics like velocity, release point, spin rate, and pitch location. On the hitting side, exit velocity, launch angle, and spray angle are all measured as well. TRAQ’s Pitch Charts tool analyzes this information and displays it in a way that is more easily digestible to the athlete. These reports can be provided to an athlete on a regular basis to track improvements over time.
Additionally, West Coast League teams will have the mid-season opportunity to bolster their rosters with Driveline-trained athletes who are eager to take their development to the next level with game action in the west’s premier summer collegiate league.
Athletes will no longer be left with the decision between training or playing summer ball. They will have the option to train at Driveline for a 4-6 week training block to focus on a specific area of development. Then, they will have an opportunity to sign with a West Coast League team to put their skills to the test for the remainder of the WCL season.
Driveline Baseball has a local connection to send its collegiate summer athletes to interested teams in order for the athlete to receive game repetitions. The goal is to seamlessly transition athletes from a development focus into competition mode where the scores count, and the games matter.
Driveline recognizes that the purpose of development is to increase the ability to perform on the field in order to help the team win. This partnership exemplifies Driveline’s mission of using a data-driven approach to making athletes the best version of themselves on the field.

Why train at Driveline this summer? - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-19T00:03:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/train-at-driveline/,"At Driveline, we have two main training “seasons”: the pro off-season and the college/high school summer. Both of these seasons are very exciting, as many athletes make the ultimate commitment by moving to Seattle and going all-in for one to three months. The 2021 college summer is especially exciting for a number of reasons.
Train at Driveline
We have moved into a brand new 43,000 square foot facility with a state-of-the-art weight room, 7 full-sized cages, and a motion capture lab for hitting and pitching.
During Summer 2021, Driveline is very excited to be offering on-field practices. These practices will include defensive work, batting practice, and shortbox scrimmages. The combination of training and on-field work will prepare athletes for a seamless transition into their fall seasons.
At Driveline, our Hitting Assessment is the foundation of in-gym training. The assessment process allows us to collect data and gather objective information on your:
Additionally, the third day of every hitting assessment now features hitting in Driveline’s motion capture lab. The motion capture lab collects biomechanical data and allows us to analyze the kinematics and kinetics of your swing.
The summer is exciting for trainees because of the option to stay for a longer period of time (the most common being anywhere from 1-3 months). Generally speaking, we have found that athletes who stay with us for a longer period of time tend to gain anywhere between 2-4 mph of average exit velocity. The following graphic illustrates these improvements for high school and collegiate athletes during the summer of 2019 (view 2018 summer results here).
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
After a skill specific warm-up with the high performance staff, athletes will migrate into one of our three full-sized hitting cages.
Using information gathered from the assessment, we design a program to improve targeted areas. In addition to bat speed and exit velocity training, our programming includes barrel control and swing decision focuses. Barrel control programs are designed for players who need a focus on making more consistent contact while simultaneously cutting down on their swing-and-miss rates. Swing decision programming is for athletes who need a focus on refining their approach, with and without two strikes. If you’d like a more detailed look into how we train hitters, our Hitter Spotlights provide insight into the assessment, training process, and subsequent athlete results: Dylan Moser, Aaron Takacs, and Division II Athlete.
After drill work, hitters train in what we like to call “game representative environments”. These training environments include high velocity machines…
…mixed pitch shortbox where hitters take at-bats vs. trainers and employees…
…and of course…Live at bats.
Summer trainees will have the option to develop their defensive skills as well. Infielders will take ground balls, turn double plays, and improve their footwork. Outfielders will take fungos, catch live fly balls during batting practice, and throw to bases.
Lastly, catchers will be able to work on pop-time, as well as their receiving, blocking, and throwing skills. Catchers will also receive graded bullpens.
Additionally, all position players will have the option to develop arm strength by executing Driveline position player specific throwing programs.
During your time at Driveline, all of your training is tracked, monitored, and constantly reiterated to ensure you are developing and improving. The test/retest model provides us with more insight into how you are progressing. Because everything is tracked, we are able to make data-driven adjustments to your training and programming. All of this is intended to ensure that you achieve optimal training results. Some of the technology we use to track results includes HitTrax, Rapsodo Hitting, Blast Motion, K-Vest, and slow motion Edgertronic camera footage.
The camaraderie created during Driveline Summer is second to none. Daily competitions prepare athletes to perform during the season, and cumulative weekly leaderboards fuel the training floor with energy and emotion. Train with like-minded athletes, all getting after it and pushing each other.
Make the best decision of your career and train at Driveline this summer.
We are very excited for summer 2021, as it will be an incredible experience for players to develop skills. NOTE: We are likely to be operating under max capacity, so assessment/training spots will be limited and filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

Off-Season Baseball Throwing Program - Driveline Baseball,2020-09-29T03:21:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/09/off-season-throwing-program/,"Yet another offseason is upon us, meaning now is the time to rest—or to put in the work that will take you to the next level. Pitchers need to decide what to focus on in their baseball throwing program. Offseason training—specifically taking time off from throwing—has been a popular target of conversation in baseball circles forever.
For professional pitchers, in particular, it’s easy to lose sight of how long the season is, which also means it’s easy to forget how short the offseason is. While highly skilled pitchers may look to take more time off in the offseason, many others are fighting for jobs and need to see an increase in one or multiple skills to continue their careers. Such high stakes make the decisions around how long to rest versus train in the offseason incredibly important. While we’ve previously discussed all of the pieces of an offseason training program, here we are going to talk about the consequences of time.
Before we get too far, however, we need to emphasize a few things. First, a professional offseason is different from an amateur offseason. It isn’t one size fits all. And for good reason—amateurs tend to need more rest than professionals.
Next, we need to discuss how you can break up an offseason. At Driveline, we divide every offseason baseball throwing program into several phases.
These training phases make up all offseasons. Picture each phase in two to six-week blocks. With roughly five months to work with during the professional offseason (October to February if you don’t make the playoffs), every player has approximately 20 weeks of development time.
As you’ll soon see: time concerns often determine the schedule when we’re trying to create the best throwing program.
Always start training plans with the end in mind, or in other words, when a player needs to be 100% ready to throw off the mound. In this case, that means Spring Training, meaning pitchers end their offseason with a mound development phase. They may be tightening up a new pitch in live at-bats or seeing how their velocity gains play up. Either way, they’ll be on the mound ready to go.
Now that you’ve started at the end, you can go to the beginning and schedule an on-ramping phase. These are the two phases that will bookend 99% of offseason training programs. The remaining 1% represents the athletes who go straight from the season to training with no time off.
Every offseason baseball throwing program will have the same bookends; what you can accomplish in between depends on one variable: time.
Some pitchers will be hesitant to start throwing earlier in the off-season but by mapping out how the program can look you can address these concerns. This can be seen here by using Pulse.
Since we know what will be at the start and the end of every offseason, let’s work backward from schedules with the most time off to those with the least to see what can be accomplished in each situation.
Not throwing until January only leaves enough time to prepare for the season. A pitcher may get a week or two off the mound before Spring Training, but not much more.
January: Four weeks of on-boarding
Late January/early February: One week of mound blending
February: One week of mound development
A general rule of thumb is the longer time off, the longer you may need to on-ramp back to 100% intensity. Meaning pitchers who don’t want to pick up a ball until January are more likely to spend their offseason preparing for the season, not developing a new skill.
This period leaves room for mound development work, such as pitch design but doesn’t leave room for any velocity work. Trying to squeeze in one to two weeks of velocity work with the impression of multiple MPH gains is shortsighted.
December: Four weeks of on-ramping
January: One week of mound blending then three weeks of mound development
February: One week of mound development
With this schedule, you can finally make some time for velocity work.
November: Four weeks of on-ramping
December: Three to four weeks of velocity work
January/February: Mound development
You might be able to shorten the on-ramp period by a week or so, but that depends on the athlete. Generally, the duration of the on-ramping period depends on how long the athlete has been away from throwing and their lowest hanging fruit.
If there are strength gains to be had, an extra week or two on-ramping on the throwing side while busting it in the weight room would be beneficial. In other cases, the pitcher may need more fine skill work, where he would be better suited to be throwing at high intent.
This is where we start to see what can be done with a full offseason of throwing, especially if a player needs improvement in multiple areas of the game.
October: Four weeks of on-ramping
November: Three weeks of on-ramping
December: Three weeks of velocity, one week of deload
January: Four weeks of mound development
February: One week of live at-bats
This schedule also gives the pitcher the most options. They may need an extended on-ramp to work on strength. Or if their strength is solid, they could fit in another 3-4 weeks of velocity development.
To determine exactly what each athlete needs to work on in the time they have available, they need to assess. We recommend to all our professional athletes that they come out right after the season to assess before they shut down (if they plan to do so).
In any scenario above, if the player doesn’t assess right after the season, the player will need to wait until after their on-ramp to have a motion capture assessment. This leaves open the possibility of not working on low hanging fruit in the on-ramping, or no throw, period. Whether it’s a mobility, strength, or mechanics issue, you can’t work on something you don’t know is an issue.
The machine of baseball tends to chew up and spit players out, so time off after a season has as much mental value as it does physical. But depending on their needs, the time off players can, or should, take may vary significantly. Every year baseball is more competitive, which may be even more true with the upcoming changes to minor league baseball. Pitching is a very fine motor skill, and to get better at a very fine motor skill, you need to practice it.

Player Development: Integration and Communication for Better Results - Driveline Baseball,2018-04-13T00:49:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/04/player-development-integration-communication-better-results/,"Player development is the holy grail of baseball. Velocity, movement, command, injury prevention: the teams that can develop these traits better and faster than others are the ones that will be, theoretically, hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy more often than any others. This doesn’t just play at the major-league level either. In fact, it’s almost more important at the college and high school levels where you can’t just shovel out huge salaries or make a trade to get the pieces you need. At the high school level, you can’t even recruit; you get whoever lands in your school district. This is why player development is so crucial to the success of an organization or team. This is why teams should invest big sums to further their players’ development.
However, that’s not what’s happening for the majority of baseball teams, especially at the affiliated level. This is a problem, because players have particular expectations. Like many others, I believed that if I was good enough to make it to the next level, to play college ball, to just get on an affiliate roster, there would be a coach there who would help me become a better baseball pitcher—because I knew I had more in the tank. Does this sound familiar?
The higher level you get to, the better coaching you believe you must receive. But that’s unfortunately not always the case, which brings us to this quote from a current minor leaguer:
“There is no player development. Teams aren’t adding velocity or any of that, the teams that appear the best at player development are the teams that are the best at not screwing their talent up.”
So, is that what good player development is? Is it just, not getting in the way? Or should it be something more?
First, we need to acknowledge that player development in-season is very difficult. While improvements can be made, development isn’t a primary focus when trying to compete and win baseball games.
Second, it comes down to the offseason—when high school and college players may be playing other sports or working around rules of contact hours, and minor leaguers are looking for another job to make ends meet.
Finally, you get into what players are doing in the off-season. You wonder if everyone is on the same page, especially when when almost thirty percent of all injuries needing surgery occur during spring training (Lindbergh, 2015).
So, if the current model isn’t ideally servicing our athletes, how do we change it? Now, I am by no means privy to all the details of player development in affiliated baseball nor am I aware of what every college and high school is doing around the country. I also realize that every player has their own unique situation and circumstances. However, since I have spent time around major and minor league clubs and coached college baseball for five years, I want to share what I see as some of the biggest issues currently facing true player development.
Any sort of self-help or leadership book almost always talks about communication. Communication as a whole is incredibly important—just ask your significant other; relationships don’t work without communication. However, often and at almost every level, we see a dearth of communication among the skill coaches, strength coaches, and the ATCs. (We won’t even begin to bring the R&D folks into this to keep it simple.) While this is not always the case, more often than not each group is siloed into their own realms and relegated to certain tasks: get them healthy, get them strong, make them throw strikes, etc. These shouldn’t be individual tasks; each group can have a positive impact in a cohesive manner.
This is where, when you really get rolling, true player development begins.
For example, consider a pitcher who’s struggling to throw strikes. The pitching coach works with him, maybe tries some mechanical changes, some drills, but however he chooses to correct it, the player either gets better or he doesn’t. The important part here is that the athlete’s skill development often begins and ends with only the pitching coach. Now, imagine instead the pitching coach takes a look at the struggling pitcher, realizes he has some mechanical inefficiencies with his lead leg, sees there’s a lot of lateral shifting, and knows that it doesn’t seem to brace well. The pitching coach then programs certain drills to improve lead-leg brace and then informs the strength coach and ATC about it as well.
The ATC does an assessment, learns the athlete is lacking internal hip rotation, so no matter how much the pitching coach does, he would have never helped that athlete to block his lead leg and improve his command. However, knowing this, now the ATC begins working to manually increase hip IR, and the strength coach programs mobility and strength work to help strengthen the hip through its newly opened range of motion. The skill coach can continue to help the athlete pattern that movement, while being cognizant of the athlete’s limitations and how he’s progressing his development.
The idea behind this process started when Kyle Boddy and Jack Scheideman took a trip to Altis, where they watched Stuart McMillin, Dan Pfaff, and others provide manual therapy while observing their sprinters’ warm-ups. They used manual therapy to adjust and correct for any movement restrictions they noticed in their athletes. The athletes, knowing their bodies and their “feel” better than anyone else also provided feedback so that the trainers could correctly treat and fine tune the athletes for that day’s workout. Through this simple communication loop, they began to not only bridge the athletes’ development gaps, but also improve their performance, allowing them to be more prepared for that day’s training or competition.
I should also point out that we know this scenario isn’t available for everyone, but it’s important for school coaches to reach out to their ATC and for facility owners to start networking local PTs, ATC, and chiropractors to refer athletes to. The goal is not to have athletes become dependent on treatment, but to provide a means of identifying limitations, treating them, and then putting athletes on a sustainable path that will allow them to be self sufficient through warm-ups and training.
My question then, is, Why are we not doing this with at least bullpen pitchers in baseball? If sabermetrics is telling us that the highest-leverage innings come later in the game, why do we not want these athletes as finely tuned for performance as possible? They often warm up for four hours before the start of the game. Four hours!
Now, that’s not four hours before they pitch; that’s four hours before first pitch. So, tack on another one and a half to two or more hours from there, and you can’t tell me that after getting hot six hours ago things haven’t stiffened back up. Just think about how you feel after sitting behind a desk for a few hours—great right? I doubt it.
So why would you not have a manual therapist working on helping pitchers feel better and become more finely tuned an inning or two ahead of their potential appearances?
While this falls under communication, making an effort to learn terminology and gain knowledge in departments outside of your own not only helps make you a better coach or trainer, but also facilitates ease of communication among groups. For example, if you understand the strength and conditioning concepts of energy systems and training economy, as a pitching coach it can help you better structure practices and coordinate with the strength coach on lifting, recovery, overreaching, and other important training factors required for player development. The same goes for the strength coach, who likely has a good understanding of the movements required for success in the sport but can benefit from understanding the movement and mechanical principles the skill coach is looking to have his athletes perform.
There are other examples of how important it is to know your training staff’s philosophies, what they’re doing to train athletes, and the terminology they use when speaking to athletes in order to make you and your athletes better, so we won’t wear this out. Just remember, the more you know about every aspect of your athletes’ training, the better you will communicate and the better you will be at training them yourself.
This is something I’ve been guilty of and that I’ve seen many smart coaches struggle with as well: it’s ok to share knowledge. It’s ok to let people into your world and to tear down that silo. All too often we feel the need to protect our knowledge. We live and work in a competitive industry and sometimes knowing more than everyone else seems like job security. You’re valued more if you know more, right? As wrong as this is, I’m sure we’ve all worked with others who have had this kind of attitude. Some of them even try to brow beat you over the head with their knowledge.
One major league strength coach I spoke with said he worked with a pitching coach early in his career who used his knowledge of biomechanics to throw other members of his staff under the bus when things went south for his pitchers. That kind of thought process doesn’t contribute to athletic development and success no matter how much you know. Not sharing information and not learning more of what your coworkers’ departments are doing limits you and your team’s ability to impact athletes positively. It also sets up a poisonous work environment. Regardless of how much that coach knew about biomechanics, you can’t tell me he was going to have long-term success. It’s just not possible with that mindset.
This is the last piece of player development we’ll touch on, so let’s set the record straight right away: Feel is not real, and technology is not the answer. You can hate sabermetrics; you can hate Rapsodo and edgertronic cameras. You can believe launch angles are the devil and deny batted-ball exit velocity.
However, the truth is you need these if you want to give your athletes the best opportunities to develop, but remember that these tools are not the answers in and of themselves. They’re simply a means of measuring improvement and providing feedback for quality control. You won’t believe how many athletes think they’re throwing a curveball only to discover on the Rapsodo that they’re actually throwing a 30% spin efficiency crappy cutter. While it may even look moderately ok to the eye, for some reason it keeps getting tattooed for doubles in the gap. Like it or not, the technology is there to help understand the why of what is happening.
But as I said, technology alone is not the answer, it needs a good coach to be able to interpret the data and communicate it to his athletes. You can’t just use the Rapsodo and edgertronic cameras to develop a new pitch if you don’t understand seam orientation, spin axis, spin rate, etc. A good coach provides feedback and suggestions based on an athlete’s feedback (i.e. feel) and data from the technology, and the same goes with hitting and using a Rapsodo or anything else you do. Regardless of the task or environment, there’s a necessity of having a coach there to discuss feel and direction; we just want to use whatever technology it is to help aid that process. It’s not meant to take over the process and it certainly isn’t there to replace a coaching staff. Instead, it should empower them to better own their athletes’ development.
Don’t be afraid of data and technology—baseball is going to the nerds and for good reason. They’re finding ways to analyze the game like never before, and this means more opportunities to understand the game and make your players better. Don’t run from it; embrace it, because players will always need coaches to show them the way and if you’re willing to look, the way forward is starting to have much better signs to guide us.
In closing, I just want to reiterate that for organizations and teams to experience peak player development, there needs to be communication. You can buy all of the technology you want, you can throw weighted balls, you can have the best, most educated coaching staff in the country, but if you’re not fully integrated with every department, if you don’t utilize your strength coaches, skill coaches, and ATCs to best of their abilities, you’re missing huge opportunities to develop your athletes.
We need everyone discussing what they’re seeing and sitting down together to formulate development plans with their athletes. It doesn’t matter if an athlete struggles with exit velocity, command, health, etc, everyone can have an impact on improving each athlete’s development. This is one of the reasons we’ve been so successful at Driveline. The more we’ve integrated all aspects of our floor into one, the better results we’ve seen, and the lower our injury rates have been.
So, let’s breakdown the silos. It’s time for a better age of player development where we don’t just avoid screwing talent up, we take talent and make it great.

I believe that your Research department should implement another aspect of assessment in pitching recovery in the form of MuscleSound. It will help to assist your team in analyzing how muscles recover after throwing and how much fuel or energy the muscles need to achieve optimal muscle size and composition.  Which to me means once the athlete is assessed with the Muscle Sound protocol then that athlete has a baseline fuel level. Then keep track of his fuel level( protein, water levels, nutrition) every 2-3 days and monitor his velo with his muscle recovery and fuel levels. The program is simple to use.  Plus  at driveline you have a steady sample size of pitchers   A university would have the same sample size. Meaning more pitchers or throwers to assess and be able to monitor and get to optimal performance. My hunch is this: if a pitcher is dominating at every start and throwing 95-98 or even. 88-93… but only lasts 4-5 starts then hits a dead period.  Could it be that the Muscle Fuel levels are low and we do not even know? Meaning If we track muscle fuel levels and compare with actual performance is there a correlation.  Could this information help each athlete ? Help each pitcher get better? Help an underdeveloped pitcher get better? I think so. After all what could it hurt? I have a Muscle Sound but really do not have access to constant athletes. Use it more for post op patients and work related injuries. But this seems to be the missing link in recovery and management of velo for pitchers after or during throwing. I have no finanacial interest in Muacle Sound but they are based in Denver Colorado and way to reach. From there I feel like Droveline can set up a protocol very easily with some outstanding conclusions that could change the way PTs., ATC  and MD and pitching organizations look at development. Why not be the pioneer ? Also could be done with hitters and any throwing athletes . The people who implement the MuscleSound can all be trained.  The software for each assessment is easy to read and is cloud based.
Integrating MuscleSound imaging of all athletes (pitchers and hitters) on a regular basis will provide an area of research for Driveline that is missing.  The correlation of muscle health ( fuel and composition) with velocity gains. I have a Muscle Sound imaging decision cue that I use on my patients and a small amount of athletes ( my son is a high school pitcher). So what I want to know is how is fuel levels correlate with his velo and what will his velo be when his fuel levels ( energy ) is full. I have been doing this for 3 weeks and his current fuel stays is low A compared to national norms and to his contrlateral side. So if he is at 29% fuel capacity now and throwing 87-91 as a 17 year old what will he be throwing at full capacity. How long do W.A. or take him to replenish his muscle fuel after he pitches a complete game.   These are all viable questions that can help everyone. I would like to see Driveline start to include this data with their research. It is easy to implement and the learning curve is easy. The tech savvy people who can scan the muscles are needed but a trainer or PT can easily do this. Muscle Sound is in Denver Colorado and easily accessed online for information.
We are open to the idea, but it is cost-prohibitive and the device lacks the open source support we require for our workload tracking integration. If the cost came down and the device/data was opened more, we would strongly consider it.

A Hierarchy of Training Needs for Baseball - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-04T04:42:40+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/hierarchy-baseball-training-needs-2/,"It seems that only strength and conditioning professionals are the ones who get fired up watching highlight videos of the fundamentals, like the well-executed squat or a technically sound hip hinge.
For much of the rest of the sporting world – those that didn’t go to school to learn the intricacies of sport performance – the fundamentals don’t carry the same weight or appeal. This is understandable. There’s nothing sexy or appealing about building the foundation – not in baseball, not in home design, and certainly not in training. We want courses specific to our college major, not general education classes that everyone must take. We desire to shop for home décor, not pour concrete. We ask for batting practice on the field, not tee work in the cage. We seek instant sporting gratification, not long-term athletic development.
But, in terms of an athletic career, it’s in the fundamentals that the majority of training exists. And, it’s in the basics that the bulk of progress and development exists.
To move beyond the basics is to begin living in the margins of training. This is a necessary part of the training timeline, but it is only part of the timeline, and a later part at that. Typically, it is the athlete who has reached the “elite” or professional status that must chase marginal gains.
The Aggregation of Marginal Gains
This process is called the aggregation of marginal gains. In other words, for the advanced athlete/trainee, we are attempting to uncover and summate every last ounce of progression. By discovering every miniscule advantage to be had from training, recovery, nutrition, psychology, etc. we are hoping to attain as many fractions of a percent in increased performance that we can. If an elite athlete can improve by 1% overall in a year, that’s pretty good considering they’re already in the 99th percentile of athletic performance. Yet, it’s in the fraction of a percent where we find the line between winning and losing at the highest levels of sport.
In training this is where the most sophisticated methodologies, protocols, and implements come into play. From bands and chains, to highly reactive jumps and throws, advanced and high-frequency recovery methods, and the minutia of nutrition. Not to mention individualization and customization of every aspect of training.
With a training age anywhere between approximately 5-20 years, the elite athlete has very different training requirements than the novice athlete with, say, 0-4 years of training experience. This is because, over time, the body’s response to a dose of training yields diminishing returns in terms of adaptation. In the first few years of training, minimal “dosages” or exposure to training loads yields great returns. Over time, these returns diminish; a point of inflexion is then reached, and thus much greater stimuli must be used to propagate adaptation.
So, why should a novice trainee – i.e. the amateur high school baseball player – chase fractions of percentages when bulk progression can be easily achieved with a more broad focus; move well and get stronger.
Unfortunately, many coaches and players do not even realize that they are chasing marginal gains. They do not know any better, thus they are compelled to utilize training methodologies that either, a) are used by the professionals (if it works for them, it will work for me, right?) or, b) are more appealing to them.
But, “not knowing any better” doesn’t have to be a fall back excuse if we can educate the amateur coach and pitcher, and that is what this post seeks to accomplish.
The goal of this post is to provide a framework for understanding the progression of training methods and the varying importance of training characteristics and methods over time – in other words, a hierarchy of baseball training needs.
Level One:
The base of the above pyramid represents the foundation of the hierarchy, and as you can see, the foundation is composed of very few aspects. The first is movement quality.
It is essential that the athlete meet a certain standard of movement competency in every movement category deemed vital to improving sport performance. In the case of my own philosophies, I believe that the Squat, Hip Hinge, Tri-Planar Lunge, Upper Body Push/Reach, and Upper Body Pull, are all integral parts of the program. The athlete must be able to perform the base regressions (e.g. the bodyweight squat or push-up) of all of these exercises before there is any need, desire, or capability of advancing to more challenging exercises. This doesn’t just mean that the athlete obtains the strength necessary to perform the movement, but also the coordination, pain-free range of motion, and postural awareness to perform it safely and effectively.
Likewise, a standard of relative strength is a critical stepping stone on the path to more advanced training methods. Without the ability to control and move one’s body weight with grace and ease, who’s to say that the athlete can move any kind of load without getting hurt – let alone with that same grace and ease.
The other reason movement quality and relative strength make up the foundation of the hierarchy is because training for these, alone, can be enough to yield great adaptation. As was stated above, greater returns on investment are made in training when the athlete has a lower training age. Thus, we do not need to worry about other factors or outcomes at this stage of training.
Level Two:
As the training age progresses other factors must be taken into consideration when training the athlete. Although any athlete can get improved performance in the first year or so without worrying too much about nutrition, recovery, or other aspects of performance enhancement, the intermediate trainee must now address these aspects to avoid greatly diminished results.
The second level of the hierarchy consists of hypertrophy and maximum strength, caloric intake, and sleep. As strength gains yielded as a result of early neurological adaptations begin to taper off by this point (the new trainee gains a lot of relative strength thanks to neurological adaptations and improved coordination), lean muscle mass and loading parameters begin to present as limiting factors for development. In other words, without attempting to expose the body to greater loads or volumes, or without increasing lean body mass, the body can only get so strong as a rapid rate. Maximizing strength and power while maintaining the lowest body weight possible is an art and science unto itself reserved for Olympic weight lifters, wrestlers, and the likes, not the baseball player or pitcher.
Therefore, if the amateur baseball player wants to attain the greatest improvements in performance over time, an increase in maximal strength will certainly help. To help increase maximal strength, an increase in lean muscle mass must be achieved, and to facilitate hypertrophy, caloric intake must match that goal. Sleep, too not only impacts performance directly, but it also is the window for which adaptations such as hypertrophy occur. Thus, over time, sleep becomes increasingly important to manage as an aid to recovery.
Level Three:
As we progress in chronology and up the hierarchy of baseball training needs, it is important to understand that by looking at the pyramid, we can not only see what we need in order to maximize performance, but also what we don’t necessarily need. As a beginner we don’t need to worry as much about sleep. Is it important? Of course, but is it vital to see great gains as a beginner? Not entirely.
At the third level of the hierarchy, the athlete is a few years into training and now must orient themselves toward the more minute and fine aspects of training to experience optimal results. For example, the quality of calories and nutrients consumed, recovery modalities, tissue quality, and some methods for training for power must be utilized.
This isn’t to say that training for power shouldn’t occur earlier in the training career. Nor does this mean that the quality and quantity of food consumption doesn’t matter to the novice trainee. But, what it does mean is, at this point in training, to see performance gains we need to start living in the margins.
In earlier stages of development and training, power output was most likely increased simply by improving strength, physical and performance goals were probably met by ensuring adequate caloric intake, and the body probably recovered well enough from a few consecutive nights of quality sleep alone. But, as the athlete chugs his or her way toward higher-level competition, these methodologies will provide diminishing returns.
Level Four:
Finally, the upper-most level of the hierarchy of baseball training needs points toward the most advanced methodologies. Oftentimes, this is where the veteran MLB’er receives treatments and training that simply allows performance at all. In other words, they are there to prolong a baseball career. To be frank, very few will ever need to know this level of the hierarchy.
It must be emphasized and understood that the hierarchy of baseball training needs is not meant to pigeonhole an athlete into one level (and therefore, into only certain training methods) based upon their training age. It is designed to help provide a framework for understanding of what the minimal dosage of training is required to see maximal gains in performance over time.
If I may, I will pose one example to drive home this point:
Imagine an incoming freshman athlete comes to me – a high school strength coach – and I give him or her the most advanced training that I can think of:

The French Contrast Method
Rigorous soft-tissue work
Strict and clear-cut eating regulations and a meal plan
And have him/her do recovery sessions each day

Now, ask yourself the following questions:

What do we expect adherence to that program to be? 100% with no mistakes or lapses?
What do we expect the injury rate to be? 
How likely is the athlete to burn out and quit?
What on Earth is this athlete going to be doing by the time he/she is a collegiate athlete, after doing all of this as a young high school athlete?
Why do all of this when we can invest much less effort and time, but get relatively equal results in the early stages of training?

Understand that, by building the base, you will only increase your likelihood of sustaining a long enough playing career to get to the advanced methodologies. And, if for whatever reason you don’t play long enough to reach the advanced methods, you can always do all of the fun and sexy stuff when you’re out of the game and performance outcomes don’t matter anymore.
Respectfully,
RJF

The Fallacy of Hard Work - Driveline Baseball,2011-06-17T22:30:23+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/06/the-fallacy-of-hard-work/,"I get it a lot from potential clients:
Except that the majority of people who say this have no idea what it will take to reach these goals. Most are content to come in to the gym 3-4 times per week, lift, take batting practice, and study their hitting and pitching mechanics before going to team practices and games. Certainly these athletes will improve rapidly and become pretty good, as many clients who come through my facility have.
But what it takes to play at the top levels of baseball – be it premier college baseball or professional baseball – takes a kind of dedication that few people have. Most athletes are content to put in what they think is “hard work,” which is basically what I outlined above. I would call that a good starting point and nothing more than that. The moment you classify your efforts as “hard work” is exactly when you stop getting better at your craft.
Consider this excellent article on 2010 1st round draft pick Josh Sale.
It is 6:15 a.m., and Josh Sale is hunting.
While several bleary-eyed teenagers amble into RIPS Baseball Training Complex, the Bishop Blanchet senior is wide awake, ready to work. He walks in with two bats — one metal, one wood — and walks past a row of cages.
Off to one side, large sheets of lined yellow paper are stapled to a green wall. There is a list of times on each sheet, and Sale’s name is written between 6 and 6:30 a.m. five days a week.
He stretches and slips on batting gloves. He steps under the netting of Cage 4 and picks up a T-ball bat. He takes one-handed cuts off a tee. Then he grabs a wooden bat and practices a walk-up approach off the tee.
One step. Two steps. Thwack. Swoosh. The ball explodes into the netting.
Then Aaron Horrocks, Sale’s personal hitting coach, lobs him some underhand pitches. After that, he takes live batting practice.
Josh terrorized amateur pitchers in the Seattle area for years. He was big, imposing, a huge physical specimen with scary bat speed and a picky eye. One of the pitchers here at our facility loves to talk about nearly getting Sale out on a dropped foul ball – only to let up a 400+ foot mammoth home run on a cutter he left over the plate. (Alright, maybe we tease him about it and he doesn’t actually enjoy hearing about it.)
Most thought Sale was a physical freak. But in truth, what made Sale an elite hitter was his dedication – his drive. He took batting practice every morning before classes, religiously followed a strength training program, ate plenty of calories to get big, and sought the toughest competition he possibly could to improve.
Taking batting practice in the morning and working out after school (and then taking more batting practice in the evening) is fun. For about two weeks. But to become the best athlete you can be, you need to repeat that effort for years – week in and week out. It sucks. You’ll hate it at times, because there’s no way you can love deliberate practice all the time.
But if you don’t put forth that kind of effort, you won’t succeed. And if you dare to call it “hard work,” well, you might as well write yourself off. There’s always something more you can do, and there’s always someone outworking you, vying for the same roster spot you want.
You have to let that drive you. You have to be driven to want to beat that guy. Maybe he has better genetics, maybe he was born with more innate talent – that’s not something you can control. If he beats you because of that, so be it. But if he beats you because you got complacent, because he outworked you – you shouldn’t be able to live with that, if you want to call yourself a competitor.
Those are the people we want in our gym. We’ll open the cages at 6 AM before school or 10 PM when you get out of work. I’ll throw you batting practice, catch your bullpens, and you can come in on your own to get your heavy lifting done or to take batting practice off our machines. But it has to come from you. I’m not your dad. I’m not your motivator. You need to want it more than anyone else in the area for your own reasons.
If that’s you, we have all the tools you need to develop into an elite athlete. All that’s missing is you and your work ethic.
