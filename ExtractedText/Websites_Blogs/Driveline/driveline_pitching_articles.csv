Revisiting Stuff+: An Update on Driveline’s Methodology to Quantifying Pitch Design - Driveline Baseball,2024-05-31T20:58:57+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2024/05/revisiting-stuff-plus/,"It’s been nearly 3 years since our first post explaining our Stuff+ model. If you haven’t read the post yet, I would highly suggest doing so, as this will largely be building off of much of the content already explained in there. Since the original post was written, we’ve seen the emergence of many public stuff models and have had significant strides from the baseball community in improving these models. Let’s explore what Driveline has done to keep our stuff model among the best in the business.
Once a model has been created, it is not as simple as just letting it sit and make predictions over time. Even if none of the inputs into the model are updated, it’s important to continue to retrain models on more up to date data, as MLB and baseball in general is constantly changing.
In the case of a stuff model, as soon as strides are made from pitchers to find an edge, hitters begin adapting to it. The best recent example of this is the sweeper. Partially due to the rise in prominence of stuff models, the sweeper began gaining traction a few years ago as an elite pitch shape, specifically against same-handed batters.
The sweeper has been an incredibly effective pitch to generate whiffs. In 2021 sweepers generated the second highest whiff percentage of all pitch types, behind only the splitter. It was after this season that sweeper usage really ticked up, but as of 2024, sweepers are now generating whiffs at rates comparable to changeups and curveballs.
It’s still a quite effective pitch, on the whole, but hitter adaptation is something we need to account for and one of the reasons we must always be on the lookout to update our models with the most up to date data.
Another clear change in recent history that we must account for is velocity. Take fastball velocity, for example.
It’s no secret that pitchers are throwing harder than ever, but there is clear hitter adaptation at play here as well. Despite consistently increasing velocity, hitter whiff percentages have hovered around between 21.5% and 22% without significant variation.
The bar is constantly being moved, and we need to make sure we are on top of the most recent changes across the league from both hitters and pitchers.
While updating the model on new data with the same inputs is valuable in itself, we have made some changes to our most recent model. That said, the basis of the model is the same, in that pitch locations are omitted and the primary ball flight metrics considered are as follows:
In addition, our main pitch types are fed into three different buckets still:
Fastballs
Breaking Balls
Offspeed
And finally, all pitch type scores can only be compared directly within their respective categories, as the conversion from expected run value to the “plus” scale occurs based on the average run value within each bucket. All this to essentially say a 110 slider is not the same as a 110 sinker.
There were two main changes to the model. The first involved improving our comparisons to a primary pitch. For breaking balls and offspeed pitches we incorporate information about a pitcher’s “primary” pitch to better contextualize any value that could stem from velocity and movement relative to what a hitter may expect. We previously defined the primary as the highest usage percentage out of either a 4-seam fastball, sinker, or cutter. In doing so, we embed a quality of “arsenal effect,” recognizing that difference in velocity or movement from a primary pitch can influence a pitch’s effectiveness.
An interesting trend we’ve noticed since the start of 2021 is an increase in potential primary pitches in a pitcher’s arsenal. This is reflected by a general trend in decreasing 4-seam fastball usage and increase in cutter usage.
It would appear as if we’ve entered a point where pitchers have more pitches that are well suited for specific platoon effects or other situations. Because of this, it is important we better contextualize what the pitcher’s true primary pitch is in a given situation. We have done this by defining a primary pitch’s velocity and movement based on the highest usage out of 4-seam, sinker, and cutter broken down by batter handedness now, rather than just overall.
A good example of this is Aaron Nola this season, who we defined as having a sinker primary vs RHH and 4-seam primary vs LHH. In this case, his breaking balls and offspeed are compared to each respective movement and velocity profile according to what the handedness of the hitter is.
The second major change we made to our model was incorporating adjusted approach angles. As mentioned in the previous blog post, our previous model only considered total movement and velocity, not how that movement occurred.
“The model currently is agnostic towards how the movement is created (spin-induced vs. non-magnus) ; it only cares that the movement and velocity is generated in some manner.”
In this iteration, we included two different approach angle metrics. The first, location adjusted vertical approach angle, gives the vertical approach angle adjusted for the vertical location of the pitch (https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-visualized-primer-on-vertical-approach-angle-vaa/). The second, adjusted horizontal approach angle, gives the horizontal approach angle adjusted for horizontal location and horizontal release point (https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-visual-primer-on-horizontal-approach-angle-haa/). In doing so, we improved our grading on pitches that have generally been known to benefit from non-magnus spin along with a more accurate depiction of some pitches that come from deceptive release points; more on these categories will be explained below.
At the highest level, cutters were the biggest gainers from the old model to the new model, with 4-seam fastballs and sweepers getting hit the hardest. It’s worth noting that, as discussed previously, the sweeper still grades out well above average, it just isn’t rated as highly as it was when the last model was trained and it was less common across the league. On the opposite end, the cutter jump is the most significant we saw, but only brought the pitch up to average.
Let’s dig into some more specific insights broken down by pitch type buckets.
The most obvious difference we found between the previous and newest stuff model was the relationship between velocity and Stuff+.
Previously this relationship was essentially linear, with every MPH in velocity being worth slightly over 6 points of Stuff+. We now recognize a more exponential relationship between the two, indicating a potentially widening gap between elite fastballs and everything else. Based on the hitter ‘s ability to hit fastballs staying relatively constant despite league wide velocity increasing, there is lots of reason to believe this is the case.
This relationship is further supported by the consistency of the “dead zone” until the ~96 MPH point. It isn’t until this point that the dead zone begins to finally shrink significantly and velocity overpowers shape.
Extending this trend to 4-seams and sinkers separately shows another interesting relationship. Our newest model generally views sinkers as more valuable than 4-seam fastballs until velocity reaches ~97 MPH.
Again, this can likely be tied back to the fact that the purpose of these two pitches is different. 4-seams are generally better at generating whiffs, while sinkers are better at generating ground balls. With whiffs being harder to get as batters have adjusted to higher velocity around the league, the sinker profile becomes more valuable than 4-seam at lower velocities. More on this from Director of Pitching Chris Langin here:
Examples of reclassifying Four-Seamers.
Instead of bucketing all four-seamers into the same classification, we would separate Pete Fairbanks' relative cutting 4-seamer from Jimmy Hergert's 4-seamer, which has significantly different action on it. pic.twitter.com/KOuWVDVQV2

Beyond velocity trends, the addition of location adjusted approach angles helped to better contextualize vertical break in fastballs. Not all vertical breaks are created equal, and low release points can create effective carry while putting up induced vertical break (IVB) numbers that aren’t conventionally impressive. A prime example of this is Alexis Diaz, who falls into the traditional dead zone with a 9.5 inch HB and 13 inch IVB profile.
Diaz’s extremely long extension (7.7 feet!) and low release point allow him to consistently reach a flatter than average vertical approach angle, giving him an above average Stuff+ on his 4-seam fastball. This relationship can be generalized to the broader population when looking at the progression of Stuff+ by shape by different location adjusted VAAs.
Our model’s view on traditional breaking balls remains relatively unchanged. Regardless of movement profile, the simplest (not always easiest) way to improve Stuff+ is to increase velocity. Take the difference between successful movement profiles from 81-85 vs 86-90 MPH.
With that being said, there were more general trends in the value of different pitch types, specifically with curveballs getting a slight bump in average value, and sweeper receiving a slightly larger hit. One particular trend is that our newest model now values low spin efficiency pitches higher than our old model previously did.
Looking specifically at pitches that can generally have lower spin efficiencies, like cutters and sliders, we can see that total movement is largely tied to spin efficiency.
This correlation matches intuition and the laws of physics, as efficiency spin creates Magnus force which contributes directly to movement. However, not all movement is created the same. Gyro spin, for instance, can create unique profiles that don’t necessarily have the largest shape but are still effective.
Including location adjusted approach angles accounts for some nuance of these effects. In doing so generally applies a higher value to low spin efficient pitches, with the two models beginning to agree as spin efficiency increases.
Stuff models will continue to remain crucial in our pitch design and on-field analysis. The changes discussed here are not all inclusive, but an example of how we can continuously improve and account for changes across MLB and baseball in general. With that being said, “stuff” is not the only component of pitching. Context from the perspective of building an effective arsenal and commanding pitches remains crucial, and Stuff+ is only one of the models we use to evaluate pitchers.

A Quantitative Analysis of the Lead Leg Block and its Contributions to Velocity - Driveline Baseball,2022-10-17T16:03:50+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/10/a-quantitative-analysis-of-the-lead-leg-block-and-its-contributions-to-velocity/,"Throughout this post we’ll take a closer look at various aspects of the lead leg block in pitching, looking through our biomechanics database to better describe how the lead leg block works to enable pitchers to throw harder. To briefly summarize the main findings:
-Athletes with more knee extension after foot plant throw harder (even within their own throws) on average.
-Athletes with more COG deceleration after foot plant throw harder on average
-COG deceleration correlates with front knee extension somewhat
-The block driving faster or more total pelvis rotation after footplant does not distinguish harder and softer throwers
-Both max vertical and anterior/posterior Ground Reaction Forces correlate with velocity – with the direction of that max force varying by athlete and not being a significant driver on average of pitch velocity
– Most of the relevant lead leg positions at footplant do not correlate notably with pitch velocity or the quality of the block.
With our last blog on the lead leg block being from 2015, we’ve since integrated our biomechanics lab into our training process for all athletes training in-gym and collected thousands of throws. We have a unique collection of high fidelity data with a plethora of pitchers from various skill levels and velocities up to 100mph in the dataset to analyze what the hardest throwers do well – which then informs our training processes.
We have touched on blocking briefly in other blogs since then, such as our initial SPM blog, however we’re dedicating space here to digging in with more detail- as well as examining the database with the throwers who’ve assessed in the lab since then. We are looking at various discrete metrics here, so this won’t be as sophisticated technically as the full signal analysis in the SPM blog, but is sufficient to address a variety of specific questions and hypotheses of interest.
We investigate three major kinematic components of blocking: knee extension, linear center of gravity velocity deceleration, and pelvis rotation. Then we’ll review our force plate data to consider the ground reaction forces. To wrap up, we consider how a pitcher’s landing position at foot-plant factors into how well an athlete is able to block across the kinematic components considered.
How important is extending the front knee?
To define knee extension, we look at the angle of the front knee at foot-plant and at ball release and calculate the difference between them. A positive value indicates that the knee extends from FP to BR.
Comparing the throws from each athlete with a repeated measures correlation, we get a moderately strong (in the context of biomechanics correlations to velocity being fairly low across the board) correlation of r = 0.29. This is pretty similar to the r = 0.27 comparing front knee extension and velocity between different throwers. That is, both athletes who extend their knee more throw harder than athletes who extend their knees less and athletes throw harder when they extend their knee more on specific throws of theirs – on average.
A couple examples to illustrate what this looks like:
Gains 34° of knee extension.
Loses 6° of extension.
A nonlinear model fits the data better,  with the key insight being the steep drop off at the low end – which is to say that athletes who sink into a lot more flexion at BR relative to where they were at FP have the most to gain by improving. At the high end, it does trend up again slightly, which seems to be driven by a couple athletes who throw moderately hard with the most knee extension.
If extending the knee is good, does that mean flexing the knee at the start is especially bad?
For this, we looked at the most flexed position an athlete reaches between foot plant and ball release and looked at how much more flexed this was relative to the knee angle at foot-plant – to consider how bad it is to sink into the lead leg more after foot-plant.
This is strongly related to how much the athlete’s able to extend their knee between FP and BR- which should come as no surprise (with extension being the inverse of flexion and us considering a portion of the same time period).
Put another way, if you leak into more flexion after foot-plant, it’s tougher to have your knee get more extended than it was at footplant. This makes sense, since we’re measuring extension against the value at foot-plant, so if you sink into 5 degrees of additional flexion in the time right after foot-plant, you now have less time to extend the knee before ball release and you have an additional 5 degrees you need to extend through just to get back to the starting point – much less get more extended.
A couple examples illustrating how sinking into more flexion can differ from the extension from FP to BR to illustrate what each specifically looks like on its own, though they are generally related to each other.
Visual for what not gaining flexion looks like (-0.78°)  – with minimal extension from FP to BR (7°)
Visual for what gaining flexion looks like (-12°)  – with extension from FP to BR (16°)
Looking at the relationship between sinking into additional flexion with velocity, we see a weaker trend than with using knee extension from FP to BR – with most of the observed trend being that it’s bad to sink into a lot of flexion (plot below). This relationship is notably weaker than for extension especially intra-subject where the r = 0.13 as opposed to 0.29. That is, looking at an athlete’s throws individually, the ones where they extend their knees more tend to correspond to the ones they threw harder more strongly than the ones where they sink into more flexion do – though there is a weak relationship for sinking into flexion as well.
Given the relationship between extending the knee from FP to BR and sinking into additional flexion after FP, it makes sense to ask if adding in how much flexion an athlete sinks into affects their velo after you account for the effect it has on their total amount of extension that they gain. If we throw them in a combined multiple regression model, we see only a marginal gain in model fit relative to the model with just the difference in knee extension angle (r^2 = 10.34 vs 10.21), suggesting that the relationship above between avoiding sinking into flexion and throwing harder is related to how avoiding sinking into more flexion makes it easier to extend the knee more – or some shared mechanism that affects both – rather than some additional value it may provide on its own.
To apply that interpretation, if you sink into lots of flexion, it’s going to make it incredibly difficult to extend your knee at all. However, if you sink into a little bit of flexion – but are able to extend your knee (like the second example from above), that’s likely less cause for concern and likely preferable to holding the same angle the entire time from foot-plant to ball-release.
Additionally, heavier pitchers (r = -0.15) and pitchers who move faster (r = -0.21) both on average sink into very slightly more flexion which is also interesting to observe.
Well what about how fast you extend your knee?
To touch on front knee extension angular velos as well, we start with the three most commonly calculated points: at foot-plant, at ball release, and the max value.
Max Front Knee Extension Angular Velocity and Front Knee Extension Angular Velocity at BR are strongly correlated with each other – so are likely redundant.
Both max and at BR correlate decently with velocity – and are similar in strength in regards to correlation with velocity (r = 0.25 inter-subject, r = 0.20 intra-subject).
Thus, these likely provide some information and are useful for assessing blocks, and either one could be used interchangeably.  Athletes who have larger differences between the two – who peak their knee extension velo before BR – don’t on average throw notably harder or slower (r = -0.065 with velocity).
Looking at front knee extension angular velo at foot-plant (how quickly they’re extending their knee as they plant their foot) – we see a much weaker relationship (r = 0.05 intra- and inter- subject). A quadratic fit is a smidge better (where extending or flexing the knee rapidly going into foot-plant are both not optimal) – but even so, still fairly weak to the point that I wouldn’t put much weight on it.
Note that this is weakly correlated with some of the other front knee metrics discussed above: r = ~0.2 with front knee extension from FP to BR (inter- and intra- athlete), r – ~0.15 with max front knee extension angular velo (inter- and intra-athlete), r = 0.13 inter- and r=-0.01 intra with front knee extension angular velo at br. Which is to say that it does relate some to those other measures – which may be part of why it has a small amount of predictive power.
A couple examples to illustrate how front knee extension angular velo at FP can differ from front knee extension from foot-plant to ball-release to show what it’s specifically measuring:
Gains 35° of extension but from -238°/sec ext velo at FP
Gains 35° of extension but from -238°/sec ext velo at FP
How important is decelerating center of gravity movement towards the plate?
After looking at a new lead leg block measurement that I was toying with last week, I wanted to take a peek at what an 'Efficient' block looked like. Out of the 10 best throws in our current database ranked by Block Efficiency, this athlete threw 8 of them pic.twitter.com/ZBjBQ5Pj4y
.@darenw inspired me (as he has with many in sports) with his animated visualsHere's the relationship between a lead leg block metric I'm looking at and FB velocity. I'm calling this 'Block Efficiency.' It's basically how much drive the pitcher stops with their block pic.twitter.com/5sfzC7hp8H
Another main component of the block is decreasing linear momentum and transferring that energy up the chain. Following on Kyle Lindley’s idea for a change in momentum metric , we calculated a metric for the change in COG velocity in the direction between the rubber and the plate, from its max to the minimum value between FP and BR.
Note that we see a trend where athletes who move down the mound faster are able to decelerate more – since they have a greater peak value to work off of. We can control for this relationship and get how much a particular athlete slows down their COG relative to how much we’d expect given their peak COG. This is pretty similar to the percentage metric Lindley first calculated – though we take residuals rather than using a ratio to avoid the assumptions ratios require, and don’t multiply by weight to avoid introducing any explanatory power since heavier athletes will on average throw harder.
You could hypothesize that stopping COG immediately after foot-plant is the most important and looking all the way up till ball-release is a relatively long time period to look at. If we look at only the first half of the window from FP to BR (so if, as an example, FP is at frame 220 and BR is at 240, looking at frames 220-230) to get an idea of how quickly athletes slow their COG shortly after foot-plant, this metric is less predictive of velocity (r = 0.15 inter-athlete and r = 0.04 intra-athlete).
That metric for COG difference during the whole period from FP to BR does relate some with front knee extension – though notably not perfectly. As you can see in the plots below, for a specific front knee extension value there’s a spread in terms of the COG difference metric:
A couple examples showing how these don’t always line-up (that I thought were interesting):
Knee extension of 6, but has the top value in terms of killing max COG velo- residual of 0.6.
Front knee extension of 36, but COG decel residual  of -0.32 which is  towards the lower end.
Note that ideally we’d separate out the deceleration of the COG of the lower half from the upper half. With the COG being the average weight position of all segments, this metric doesn’t account for athletes who slow down their lower half and use that to propel their upper half towards the target more than others (as the examples above illustrate).
How important is finishing Pelvis Rotation and increasing Pelvis Rotational Velo after Foot-plant?
The third major component of the block that is often talked about (along with converting the linear momentum up the chain, and the knee extending) is driving/finishing rotation of the pelvis:
To investigate this, we look at how much the pelvis rotates between foot plant and ball release (so pelvis angle at BR – pelvis angle at FP) – which does not notably relate to pitch velo (r = -0.07 inter- and r = 0.10 intra-athlete).
Note that this is strongly related with pelvis rotation at foot-plant (plot below). That is athletes who land with a more closed pelvis on average rotate their pelvis more between foot-plant and ball release. Controlling for this relationship (to look at athletes who rotate their pelvis more than we’d expect given their pelvis rotation at footplant) doesn’t strengthen the relationship with velocity (r = -0.06 inter- and r= 0.10 intra-athlete again).
Looking at pelvis rotational velo rather than just the positions, we compared pelvis rotational velo at FP with the max after FP (technically 1 frame after to avoid any overlap for people who only decelerate after) up to BR.
We see a small portion (7.8%) of athletes who’s max pelvis rotational velo after FP is no greater than their pelvis rotational velo at FP, with guys on average increasing their pelvis rotational velo by 136°/sec from FP to their max before BR.
This does not correlate notably with velo (r = -0.07 inter-subject and r = -0.01 intra-subject)
This does relate moderately with pelvis rotation at FP – where guys who have more closed pelvises at foot plant gain more pelvis rotational velo by ball release (some of which may be coming from having slower rotating pelvises at FP and some from having a larger arc to accelerate through).
To provide a couple visual examples of what outlier pelvis rotational velo gains look like – for reference:
Pelvis Rot Velo Gain of 425 – 98th percentile
Pelvis Rot Velo Gain of -36 – 1st percentile
We can similarly look at front hip internal rotation positional changes and front hip internal rotation velo since that captures rotation around the front hip that may provide more context in regards to femur positioning than just looking at global pelvis rotation, but we get similarly weak and non-notable results for change in front hip IR from BR to FP (r = 0.007 inter- and r = 0.09 intra-athlete) and max hip ir velo from between FP and BR (r = -0.03 inter- and r= 0.01 intra-athlete).
How should we weigh the different components when evaluating blocks given that there’s some overlap between them?
All that being said – how should we account for those different components when evaluating a block? To answer this question we built a multiple regression model predicting velocity taking in the variables from the different components of blocking. This allows us to calculate the best linear formula for predicting velocity using different variables. Thus, it provides a way to calculate how we’d expect different variables to contribute to velocity while controlling for the other input variables, and therefore identify what unique information each variable offers.
With Front Knee Extension from FP to BR and the COG decel metric correlating the most with velocity on their own, it’s not surprising that they provided the largest increase in model explanatory power. Adding front knee extension angular velo at BR and the max value on top of these two didn’t increase performance – so it seems that the information those would add is already captured in those two initial metrics. Similarly, we also tested out adding pelvis rotation related metrics to see if they would show up as more notable when controlling for the effect of the other components of blocking, and it still came up as not adding much.
Looking at the top blocks by this combined metric (hereby dubbed the composite block metric), we see the top performers are those with the most lead knee extension with some guys getting a bit more credit because they slow down their COG more effectively, though they also straighten their knees decently as well.
Top composite block score
2nd highest
8th best, which this pitcher achieves by having elite COG decel as well as good lead knee extension
How do ground reaction forces relate to those kinematic measures of the block and to velocity?
With the addition of force plates to our lab and processing pipeline, we have the ability to dissect the lead leg block even further beyond what you can pick up from video and motion capture – by looking at ground reaction forces.
While we’ve done a couple case studies before looking at force plate data such as in these blogs from 2016 and 2017; none of these have anywhere close to the sample of force plate data we’ve been able to collect with the set-up in our lab now – where we have more than 800 unique sessions with force plate data.
Looking at lead leg ground reaction force broken up into X/Y/Z components for the anterior-posterior/lateral/and vertical components, we see that the anterior-posterior and vertical components correlate to velocity with similar strength (r = 0.38 for x, and r = 0.44 for z) – whereas the y component (going between first and third) does not as strongly (r = 0.19).
However all of these are inflated by the fact that heavier athletes throw harder across the sample of HS/College/Pro athletes we have here – so that confounds the relationship observed here.
After we control for body-weight, the correlation for all three of the components drops off some, but the vertical and anterior-posterior components winds up in a similar neighborhood to what we observed for the key kinematic measures of the lead leg block (r = 0.19 for x, r = 0.23 for z, r = 0.1 for y – and r = 0.25 for the max magnitude considering all three components).
Looking at some of the force plate data we’ve collected (n = 1043 throws) at @DrivelineBB, we see max rear and lead leg horz and vert GRFs correlate to pitch speed about as strongly as key kinematic measures (r = 0.2-0.25) across a similar sample. Two examples of those GRFs. 1/6 pic.twitter.com/sz4VEG2JiZ
An interesting result here is that the X and Z components both correlate with similar strength to velocity – whereas some of the previous literature had found the X component to matter more – in smaller samples. If we consider the direction of the force (where 90 degrees is all vertical force, and 0 degrees is all horizontal force with no vertical component), we see no correlation to velo. That is, on average there does not seem to be a general recommendation for what angle you should aim to put force into the ground across all athletes, but merely that putting more force into the ground with your lead leg is better.
Comparing the max Lead Leg force into the ground with the Block Composite Score calculated from the different kinematic areas we see that they are correlated, but that correlation isn’t all that high in context of what you might expect (r = 0.26). Which is to say that the kinematic measures give us some idea of the force put into the ground, but there’s more detail that we’re able to get at leveraging the force plates that doesn’t show up in the kinematic measures – giving us another measure tool for assessing and diagnosing athlete’s training needs.
With the force plates in our lab at @DrivelineBB, we see athletes who extend their lead knee faster after foot-plant typically put more force into the ground (good example of both those in pitcher 3 here), but we do see some variance in regards to that (pitchers 1-2 here). 1/3 pic.twitter.com/aYAYECeS7c
How does landing positioning affect this composite block metric and the different blocking metrics?
The table above shows the inter-subject (comparing different athletes) and intra-subject (comparing throws from each athlete) correlations comparing different metrics of interest for blocking with foot-plant positioning metrics. Relationships I think may be of interest highlighted in orange. The relationships between these various landing position metrics and our composite block metric are all very weak – which suggests to me that landing position is not the primary determinant of an athlete’s blocking ability.
We considered 4 positional metrics at foot-plant – front knee flexion, front ankle dorsi/plantar flexion, pelvis rotation, and hip internal/external rotation. For each of these, I took a look at how they compared to ball velo, the composite block metric, detailed above, and then front knee extension from FP to BR, front knee flexion from FP to the min after FP, COG decel after FP, and Max Front Knee Extension Angular Velo which were the main metrics discussed above.
First we consider the angle of the knee at foot-plant, since it’d seem that how this angle is initially set would significantly affect how the block works. Quick visual demonstration of the variability we see:
35° on left (3rd percentile)                                                                        68° on right (98th percentile)
Thus a larger number is a more flexed knee at foot-plant. Most of the relationships come back as non-notable when combining the inter- and intra- athlete analysis.
The one relationship that is notable in both is the relationship between front knee flexion and sinking into additional flexion after foot-plant – we get r = 0.26 comparing different session-level averages per athlete and r = 0.2 comparing all throws within each athlete.
This relationship indicates that having a more bent knee at foot-plant leads to sinking into flexion less after foot-plant. That might seem counterintuitive at first, but as the knee is already more bent, it’s less likely to bend even more. Furthermore, it’s possible that the athlete has a particular joint angle that they’re stronger in – so by landing in a more flexed position – that could theoretically be more advantageous for extending out of.
Front ankle dorsi/plantar flexion is going to be decently related to front knee flexion angle (r = 0.40), but I thought it would be interesting to consider as well, since they don’t line up 100%.
Ankle dorsiflexion at 59°                                                   Ankle dorsiflexion at 91°
Here, most of the relationships come back non-notable, so it doesn’t seem to be a huge determiner of someone’s ability to block, especially since there’s no notable correlation to ball velo or the composite block metric.
After looking at the lead leg positions specifically, we consider pelvis rotation (axially, so omitting anterior/posterior tilt and lateral tilt of the pelvis in this analysis) next – as if the pelvis is open enough is often considered a factor in blocking ability.
A quick visual at high and low pelvis rotation numbers to illustrate:
Pelvis Angle at 15°                                                                        Pelvis Angle at 65°
There’s a negligible relationship between pelvis rotation at FP and ball velo (r = 0.08 between-athlete, r = 0.02 within-athlete) and pelvis rotation at FP and the composite block metric (r = -0.04 inter-athlete, and r = 0.03 intra-athlete) – which immediately qualifies the importance of having the pelvis open at foot-plant for blocking. If getting the pelvis open was a prerequisite for being able to block, you’d expect harder throwers and better blockers to get their pelvis more open – which on average they do not.
We do see that athletes who land with more open pelvises on average sink less into flexion after footplant (as well as intra-subject – where athletes sink less into flexion after foot-plant on throws where their pelvis is more open). The correlations here are the strongest of any of these landing position correlations  (r = 0.34 inter-, and r= 0.45 intra-subject). By landing with the pelvis more open, an athlete may avoid sinking into more flexion but in the process also reduce the amount of time they have for their leg to impart force into the ground before ball release – and thus just be trading off sinking into a little bit of flexion at the expense of having time to put force into the ground.
If someone is sinking into a lot of flexion and not getting any extension, it’s possible that opening the pelvis more up may help, by affording them less time to do so – but I don’t think that fully addresses the issue of lack of extension given the lack of a relationship between pelvis angle and throwing harder or blocking better (as measured by the composite block score)
Last one on the docket is Hip IR/ER. It  is a bit more subtle in terms of being able to see it than the other landing position metrics. We have a couple athletes with more extreme values to illustrate:
Low Hip IR/ER at FP of -25°                                            High Hip IR/ER at FP of 46
°
This metric is looking at the rotation of the front femur relative to the pelvis. When looking for it, you can see the athlete on the left have his femur turned inwards in relation to the pelvis as opposed to the athlete on the right who has his turned out.
We see more Hip ER at FP related to sinking into more flexion after FP, and getting less extension of the knee between FP and BR. From looking at athletes with extreme hip ER values (screenshots below) – we can see how being more externally rotated may put an athlete in a disadvantageous position to be able to extend the knee. Nonetheless, as with the other landing position metrics, Hip ER at FP doesn’t relate notably to throwing harder or blocking better in general, so this may be a possible option to explore with athletes with extreme ER, but isn’t something that necessarily weighs heavily when evaluating and troubleshooting an athlete’s blocking ability.
The ability to analyze mechanics from all the pitchers who have come through the lab allows us to rigorously test out a variety of hypotheses to determine what distinguishes hard throwers from slower throwers. We see our hard throwers extending their knees more and faster, putting more force into the ground vertically and horizontally, and slowing their center of gravity down more than the slower throwers on average.
Thus, checking out knee extension provides a valuable check-point when considering an athlete’s mechanics – which relates to the athletes ability to slow down their body and transfer that energy up the chain and put force into the ground. We don’t see the quality of the lead leg block being dictated by the position an athlete lands in – suggesting that the lead leg block is a skill/movement that likely needs to be trained (with drills like rockers, roll-ins and drop-steps) – and won’t necessarily address itself completely just by changing how an athlete moves into foot-plant.
While we’ve aimed to be thorough here, there’s always more areas to investigate. We touched on force plate components in this analysis, but there’s further analysis on the timing of ground reaction forces and the relationship between putting force into the ground and how that coincides with different movements. Besides that, the role of strength and mobility on blocking ability is often talked about and would be interesting to discuss here, but that’s an analysis for another time.

Dillon Tate: Utilizing Biomechanics for Player Development,2022-03-17T00:37:57+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/03/dillon-tate-using-biomechanics-for-player-development/,"In 2019, Dillon Tate made his MLB debut. We’ve been fortunate to get to work with him each offseason since then, giving us a unique dataset to work with—longitudinal mocap sessions over 3 years for a big league pitcher. Year over year, his fastball average velocity and peak velocity has consistently increased.
It’s impossible to summarize all the factors that went into making these plots possible. To go from averaging 92 to 94 mph —> 95 to 96 mph in just one to two years is actually ridiculous. You could write tens of thousands of words attempting to summarize the work that happened consistently—from the weight room, the Plyo Ball ® wall, recovery, as well as programming decisions, drill modifications, and cues from the Director of Pitching, Bill Hezel, at each step along the way. Everything matters.
While we can’t get into everything that happened, we can dissect the biomechanics reports that we’ve collected over the last few years to glean clues that led to this success. And that illustrates the true power of these biomechanics reports at the elite level.
We have actionable and objective data quantifying how Dillon Tate moved each offseason. There’s no guesswork here. Having multiple synced high speed camera angles of the pitching motion can tell us a lot. But it can also trick us and it’s easy to let coaches bias happen without having numbers to actually back it up.
Thanks to the mocap lab, we have data points that quantify Tate’s exact positions and movements in space down to the millimeter at 240+ frames per second.
Dillon Tate had an average velocity of 93.3 mph during this session. Which would qualify him for the elite group in our database that helps build out our normative ranges and programming recommendation algorithms. We knew there was more in the tank and his ceiling was much higher than low to mid-90s. When he was drafted in 2015, his fastball velocity was up to 98 previously.
We don’t know exactly how he moved in 2015, further highlighting one of the biggest value adds behind the motion capture report. Right now, we have multiple reference points of Tate’s mechanics each year to refer back to if something ever feels wrong. We can look back and identify what he was doing when things were going well and attempt to correct based on that objective data.
There’s plenty of low-hanging fruit to pull from his earlier biomechanics reports. Here are a few things that stuck out:
In the plot below you can see Tate’s SHA overlaid on top of the normative ranges of some of our harder throwers. He’s right in the middle throughout the motion (not surprising since he is one of our harder throwers already):
To illustrate scap retraction even further, here’s an overhead look at his pitching mechanics showing that ~40 degree angle between his torso and humerus around foot plant
Again, you can see that nearly all of these angles fall within the normative ranges for our elite throwing population. This shouldn’t be a surprise, it’s a big league pitcher throwing 93 mph. But the torso angle and hip shoulder separation angle are both on the fringes of falling out of those normative ranges. Video below show the interaction between the trunk, pelvis and how it creates hip shoulder separation. In this throw specifically, his trunk is open to nearly 25 degrees at foot plant.
We can’t get into everything that showed up in the report biomechanically, and most of it was good anyways. We’re working with an already athletic big leaguer that is throwing low – mid 90s velocity. We’re chasing gains on the margins to find where his ceiling truly is. And the focus around that put simply was:
These bullet points are all likely related. If the trunk rotates early, it’ll pull the humerus out of scap retraction early, wasting the scap retraction that you are creating. An early trunk and low scap load is also going to make it hard for the arm to rest back deeper into layback (increase MER). As the humerus wraps around the already rotating trunk, the window to get into MER shrinks quickly.
We’ve now taken millions of data points that quantify movement and distilled it down into a plan of attack. This is what it looks like to leverage biomechanics data.
The velocity numbers for Dillon Tate in-season speak for themselves. I mean seriously, look at these plots again ⬇️
Obviously velocity is not the only thing that matters here, but we know it’s value, we’ve quantified it before. For anyone that hasn’t read that series by Dan Aucoin, here’s one of the most important excerpts:
“We took a hypothetical player, held his IP constant at 75 (a hedge between a starter and reliever), and calculated his WAR before and after a .2443 point reduction in RA9. We found that adding 1 mph to a player’s FBv increased the expected production of said player by ~.25-.35 WAR per season, depending on whether he was a starter or reliever.
Tate has small samples in 19’ and 20’(due to the pandemic) but you can still parse out the value of this velocity increase on RA9, FIP, and WAR.
So things are looking good on Baseball Reference, but what (if anything) actually changed mechanically?
The velocity increase that Dillon Tate had in season showed up in the lab too, running his fastball up to 95.4 mph during the mocap (averaging 94.7 mph). Here are two synchronized pitches from January ‘20 (Red) and January ‘21 (Green). Looks pretty similar right? Hard to tell the differences even when they’re throwing side by side. It gets a little easier when they’re superimposed on top of one another. With biomechanical data, we can quantify these differences.
Visual comparisons below:
It’s a even easier to see the difference when having them side by side too:
One thing you can notice in the last video is how trunk angle changed into foot plant. The trunk is staying counter rotated longer which is helping create additional scap retraction. This is huge for the hip shoulder separation changes we were looking to make as well:
More visual comps below:
Side by side visual below showing the differences in trunk angle(dashed line) and hip shoulder separation(solid line):
This doesn’t cover everything that changed biomechanical with Dillon Tate, but these are a few of the most notable comparisons between the sessions. They also highlight some of the most important features of pitching mechanics that we see internally.
Can we definitively say that the increases in scap retraction, better trunk angle, and increased hip/shoulder separation led to his velocity boost? No.
But we can make a pretty damn strong case with just the evidence presented above. It stands to reason that those changes had a significant effect on his arm speeds as well. Look at the increase in maximum elbow extension and internal rotation angular velocities between sessions
Being “data-driven” is easier said than done. The summary at the beginning looking at the initial motion capture report is fairly easy after you’ve done it for awhile. We could have stopped there. “Hey, here’s a plan that we think could work, good luck.” We could have taken the velocity increase from 2019 – 2020 and just ridden on the wave of positive results.
But that’s not really being data-driven. We needed another data point to see what happened between January of ‘20 and January ‘21 that could explain such a significant velocity increase. You have to be willing to be wrong. Regardless of how convicted you are in the assessment and plan that you laid out, if you’re not willing to look at the data again and see if it backs it up or refutes your initial theory, then you shouldn’t have bothered collecting it in the first place.
That’s also the best way to learn more throughout the process. We’ve had biomechanical models and theories for mechanics that have been wrong before and we’ll be wrong again. But because we’re willing to be wrong, we’ll always stay at the front of mechanical analysis and leveraging biomechanical data in a player development setting.

Those last two paragraphs speak volumes and mirror what I told my students for years.  I don’t mind coming back later and saying, “Hey, that is what we knew and thought was best.  But now we are changing because we were wrong.”  Keep putting out the great information!

Ultimate Guide to Baseball Pitch Grips - Driveline Baseball,2022-01-11T00:14:48+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/01/ultimate-guide-baseball-pitch-grips/,"By Chris Langin, Pitching Coordinator & edited by Michael O’Connell Director of Education, updated 4/22/2022
Baseball pitch grips spark a special interest among pitchers for a good reason. This has been fueled by stories of pitchers developing dastardly pitch profiles with seemingly simple changes. While there are incredible resources that detail different types of grips across the league, such as Pitching Ninja’s Dropbox, why are these so popular? Everyone wants to know the best baseball pitch grips, and if you can find a pro that throws a specific grip, you can throw a pitch with that grip.
This blog will discuss our system for tracking and measuring pitch grips. At Driveline, we have taken pictures and measurements of every athlete that has walked into our facility over the last few years. After explaining our system, which accounts for minor variations in grips, we’ll walk through the most common variations and pitch grips for the most popular pitches.
Why did we create this system?
We wanted to group pitches to match players with grips faster than before. So we could analyze them in much more specific ways than ‘Clayton Kershaw’s curveball.’
The rest of the blog will discuss the pieces we find most important to track—or be aware of—when figuring out how to adjust a pitcher’s arsenal.
With the increase in pitch-tracking technology, different pitches and pitch type variations have grown. With the ability to measure movement down to the inch, coaches and players can now compare and contrast many more pitch types. Small changes in movement can matter a lot, and pitchers can often have different names for pitches that can move the same. Even with these issues, we can break down the different types of baseball pitches into six main pitch types, which we’ll break down here along with common adjustments to each.
As we’ve collected more information on baseball pitch grips, it’s not just the pitch grip and release that’s essential, but tiny variations can help pitchers gain better command or more movement.
From a player’s perspective, minor adjustments in how a pitcher grips the seams of a ball can create more movement than expected.
Picking a new pitch isn’t just copying a grip that you find here but also understanding how to think through minor grip variations to see if you can get it to work for you. Things may not click right away, so we should expect tweaks as we’re looking to learn a new pitch.
The grip is only as important as the movement profile it creates. You want to know the grip of a specific pitch to try and get the movement of that pitch. You want to know Mariano Rivera’s cutter grip and Clayton Kershaw’s curveball grip so you can throw it. Learning a new pitch is much more than just trying out a new grip!
When logging grips, we want to capture as much relevant detail as possible because if we can find the right grip and release, we can throw a nasty pitch.
There are several factors to consider when changing grips. Beyond trying a brand new pitch grip, we want to count minor adjustments that can result in different movements. We want to track these changes because we want to answer the question – what is the best pitch grip per pitch type for this pitcher right now?
We’re trying to balance holding the ball with a specific grip, a player’s comfort, and a specific release of the baseball to create a successful pitch.
Below are the five main factors we discuss when looking to adjust baseball pitch grips.
Pitchers may adjust a base grip outward/inward to slightly change seam orientation and how their fingers come off the ball.
If an athlete is insistent that their grip is comfortable but doesn’t move well, a simple grip pressure adjustment might do the trick. Though these adjustments may depend on the specific pitch you are working on, cueing for different pressure with the index or middle finger can result in a change.
An athlete cued to “throw a sideways curveball” is likely to throw a pitch with a different movement profile compared to being told to throw the ball “as hard as humanly possible.”
Simple cues like “stay through the ball,” “throw the back of your hand at the target,” or “throw it like a football” may all be helpful cues for certain pitches. We feel it’s best to be flexible with cues and worry less about forcing one cue to work.
Thumb positioning potentially influences how the ball comes out at release. Pitchers that place the thumb underneath the ball on a given grip may find it easier to stay through the ball at release. Minor adjustments to the side of the ball may make it easier to get around the ball.
Additionally, we’ll look to define whether or not the thumb is “flat” or “tucked.”
Whether a pitcher uses a spike grip often depends on fingertip pressure and the type of movement profile they are looking for.
Spiking the ball may help get more middle fingertip pressure on the seam without having a coach cue it.
Additionally, the index finger can interfere with the spin direction of a breaking ball when it’s released. Applying a spike alternative may result in a more downward movement to get more drop on a curveball.
Taking a spike variation off a pitch may result in a more upward spin direction, which could benefit when working on a slider.
We believe grip depth is a big part of grip comfort. Different hand sizes may be a reason for changes in grip depth. Some pitchers may need to choke a four-seamer in the palm for better feel. Others need to leave some space between the palm and the ball. Changing the depth of the grip may also allow an athlete to find a seam to pull off of or get the thumb to a more comfortable location.
This is a lot of pitch grips and a lot of variations! We want to ensure that we’re giving our athletes the best information to make better decisions faster. Now that we’ve gone over our system of tracking grips let’s get into the most common pitch grips for different baseball pitch grips.
Four-seam grips are relatively standard, and we see two main variations. These variations are the fingers’ width, either more narrow or wider, and whether the seam is on the fingertip or first knuckle.
Tilt and ball position
We don’t see many adjustments in tilt. But there are differences between athletes in whether their fingertip is on the seam or their first knuckle.
Fingertip pressure (coaching cues):
“Stay behind the ball,” “Pull the ball down,” “Apply more pressure on the ball,” “Hold the ball tighter,” “Pronate sooner.”
Thumb Position
Thumb positions are either flat or tucked. Pitchers that place the thumb underneath the ball may find it easier to stay through the ball at release.
Spike Alterations
We don’t see any spike variations of four-seam fastballs.
Depth of Grip
Some adjustments in depth of grip depend on comfort, hand size, and if minor changes in grip result in movement changes. How deep a player holds the ball is often an adjustment that goes hand in hand with their thumb position.
Want to learn more about the movement of a four-seam fastball, more grips, and how to throw one?
Tilt and ball position
Seams and tilt can be important for two-seam pitches. Because of seam-shifted wake, minor adjustments on the seam and slight cut can cause two seamers to move more than expected.
Fingertip pressure (coaching cues)
“Stay through it,” “Get over the top of it,” “Roll over the ball.”
Thumb Position
The most common thumb positions are either flat or tucked. Pitchers that place the thumb underneath the ball may find it easier to stay through the ball at release.
Spike Alterations
We don’t see any spike variations of two-seam fastballs.
Depth of Grip
Some adjustments in depth of grip depend on comfort, hand size, and if minor changes in grip result in movement changes. How deep a player holds the ball is often an adjustment that goes hand in hand with their thumb position.
Want to learn more about the movement of a two-seam, more grips, and how to throw one?
Tilt and ball position
Pitchers will often tilt a four-seam grip outward for their cutters to get on the side of the ball while still feeling like a fastball. You can see this in the first cutter grip on the left. The second grip is similar to a two-seam fastball grip. The different movement comes from a different release.
Fingertip pressure (coaching cues)
Cueing ‘Focus on middle finger pressure’ should help a pitcher get around the ball at release.
Other cues include “Think palm facing first base” and “Think slider.”
Cues for cutters are relative to their starting point. We should expect different cues if you’re trying to turn a four-seam fastball to a cutter or have a slider get less movement.
Thumb Position
Pitchers trying to turn a slider into a cutter may find it helpful to move their thumb more underneath the ball.
Spike Alterations
Depth of Grip
Want to learn more about the movement of a cutter, more grips, and how to throw one?
Tilt and ball position
Fingertip pressure (coaching cues) – A pitcher cued to emphasize middle finger pressure may get around the ball more at release.
“Throw the back of the hand,” “Throw it like a football,” “Pull on the side of the ball,” and “Slash the zone in half diagonally.”
Pitchers that prioritize index finger pressure on a slider may shift the spin direction of a pitch upward and take a pitch with slurve characteristics closer to slider territory.
Thumb Position
Moving their thumb more to the side of the ball may help drive a cutter into a slider.
Spike Alterations
Depth of Grip
Want to learn more about the movement of a slider, more grips, and how to throw one?
Tilt and ball position
Fingertip Pressure (coaching cues)
“Get in front of the ball,” “Spin the ball with your middle finger,” and “Throw with the back of your hand.”
Thumb Position
Spike Alterations
Spiking the index finger may help athletes put more pressure on the ball with their middle finger without a cue.
Depth of Grip
Want to learn more about the movement of a curveball, more grips, and how to throw one?
Tilt and ball position
For changeups, a pitcher with a 2-seam grip may laterally tilt the position of the fingers towards the thumb to get away from a seam at release and decrease raw spin.
Fingertip pressure (coaching cues)
“Roll over the ball,” “Throw it with your ring finger,” “Pronate sooner,” “Swipe inside of the ball,” “Think about having a flexible wrist.”
Thumb Position
Spike Alterations
Depth of Grip
Athletes may “choke” the grip deep in their path to lessen spin and velocity on the pitch. However, some athletes may achieve this by gripping the ball in their fingertips “like an egg”.
Want to learn more about the movement of a changeup, more grips, and how to throw one?
Want to experiment with different baseball pitch grips? Keep in mind how hard you are throwing!
The most straightforward method of improving the “stuff” characteristics of fastballs and breaking balls is to throw harder.
Method 1 – Gain FB Velo 🔥🔥🔥13/30 hurlers fell under this category. Simple, but effective.This group also outpaces a linear models expectation for SL velo gains.Controlling for SL movement, 1 FB tick tends to convert to ~.75 ticks to the Slider and ~8.5 units of Stuff pic.twitter.com/PjROUsie8k
There are a couple of reasons we want to keep this in mind.
First, velocity is still essential when discussing what makes an effective offspeed pitch.
Second, bullpens or pitch designs aren’t always thrown at game-like intensity. Velocities are generally down relative to in-game averages for a few reasons, including decreased adrenaline.
Pitchers may unintentionally slow down their delivery and pitch speed to try to make a shape ‘work’ to what they think it should do.
Intent level and how an athlete “feels” vary from session to session. Some pitch design sessions are thrown at 70% RPE, others at 95% RPE. Breaking balls will always play better in the 95% sessions, as there’s more fastball velocity to tradeoff to secondary offerings. However, we are primarily concerned with how the shape of the offering relates to that day’s fastball velocity.
The faster you throw your fastball, the harder we’d expect your breaking ball to be. Looking at MLB data, when pitchers gain one mph on their fastball, we see slider velo climb 0.75mph and improve in stuff+ by 8-10 units.
As we mentioned at the top, the pitch grip is important only because of the pitch movement. This makes testing pitch grips with something that can measure pitch movement, the best way to learn a new pitch.
At Driveline, we obtain a  “baseline” profile of an athlete’s pitches when they enter the gym. We can then see how differing cues/grips impact the offerings relative to their baseline profile. Understanding where pitchers start gives both the coach and the athlete some additional context to rule out certain pitch shapes and easily recall optimal grip/cue combinations when they leave the facility or start to lose feel for the offering.
By logging this information, we can more confidently rule out that the athlete isn’t throwing a poor breaking ball due to a poor coaching process.
Without knowing what an athlete has tried before, it’s tough to know what changes to make.
By controlling for and tracking all of the above, we aim to shed more light on what changes impact ball flight metrics and how to improve pitches faster.
This allows our athletes to be more efficient with their training economy, shortening the time it takes to learn a new pitch. Ultimately leading to the end goal of allocating more time towards mound development and the command of the offering.

Changes in Ball Weight: A Method for Athlete Individualization - Driveline Baseball,2022-01-05T18:49:05+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/01/changes-in-ball-weight-new-plyo/,"By Stephen Hart, Pitching Coordinator
Over the years, we’ve come to notice a trend among certain athletes, especially our amateur athletes: Many struggle to perform the pivot pickoff drill with the black Plyo Ball ®.  Anecdotally, our coaches often see or hear things like this:
“It feels like I’m just pushing it.”
“It just doesn’t feel smooth compared to the green ball.”
“It looks like you’re throwing darts.”
If that sounds familiar, keep reading…
As a department, we knew we needed to create a solution that would allow athletes to throw more comfortably while still offering an overload constraint to help engrain new movement patterns.
Introducing the 3 lb pink Plyo Ball ®.
We tested it with a select few experienced athletes, and they gave it great praise and rave reviews, but we knew that we needed to test it more before we rolled it out to the whole gym. In particular, we needed to know how it differed kinematically from the black and green Plyo Ball ® within our drill set.
Across 30 athletes, 142 pivot pickoff throws were collected in our motion capture lab for each ball type (green, pink, and black). The table below provides an overview of the descriptive statistics regarding the captures collected.
After the data collection phase of our investigation was completed, our sports science department examined kinematic and kinetic differences between ball weights in the following metrics:
Is there a significant difference between ball weights when it comes to maximum shoulder external rotation? In other words, when using the green, pink, and black balls, do athletes tend to achieve a significant difference in layback?  Admittedly, we hypothesized that athletes on average would achieve less layback with the black Plyo Ball ®, as it is fairly common for athletes seemingly to exhibit a ‘pushy’ arm action during pivot picks.
However, it would seem the ol’ ‘eye test’ has failed once again. The data suggests, as seen in the density plot below, that there is no significant difference in layback between any of the balls.
When examining shoulder abduction (elbow height in relation to the shoulder joint) at MER, there was also no significant difference between any of the balls. This would suggest that, despite the increases in ball weight (of up to 4 lbs), on average an athlete’s shoulder rotation stays on plane with their upper body, relative to the other ball weights. Put more succinctly, athletes do not demonstrate any meaningful difference in elbow height relative to their body at MER.
As a brief refresher, SHA, or scap retraction, is the angle of the humerus (upper arm) relative to the torso. Zero degrees of SHA would have your upper arm in line with your torso, while a positive number would indicate that your upper arm is behind your torso (as shown in the image below).
With this, we’ll first examine differences in max SHA (scap retraction, in layman’s terms).  Meaning, throughout the duration of the throw, how far behind the body does the athlete’s upper arm travel? From our dataset, max SHA is a very important metric and (one of many) strong predictors of throwing velocity.  A possible explanation for this is that an increase in max SHA, which likely creates an increase in SHA at foot plant, creates a greater stretch-reflex across the pectoralis and deltoid muscle groups and greater range of motion to accelerate the baseball.
From our dataset, shown in the scatterplot below, on average athletes display an increase in throwing velocity as the amount of SHA (scap retraction) at foot plant increases.
When examining max SHA across all ball types, we found a significant difference between all three balls. When looking at the density plot below, on average there was a gradual increase in max SHA as ball weight decreased. The average max SHAs for each ball type were 20, 25, and 29 degrees for the black, pink, and green balls, respectively.
Next, let’s move on to SHA at MER. With this metric, we’re examining, in layman’s terms, the following question: When the athlete achieves max layback, how far behind their torso is their arm? We found some differences. Specifically, while there was no significant difference between the pink and black balls and no significant difference between the green and pink balls, we did find a significant difference between the green and the black balls. Such a significant difference can be seen in the density plot below.
This would indicate that, on average, athletes performing pivot pickoffs with the green Plyo Ball ® have more SHA at MER than those throwing the black and pink Plyo Ball ®. While the value is still negative (upper arm in front of torso at MER), athletes throwing the green Plyo Ball ® exhibit a more favorable MER position when looking at SHA specifically. Oftentimes when athletes throw the black ball, they tend to exhibit a more elbow dominant (think throwing a dart) throw. This more negative SHA at MER value reinforces these observations..
Elbow flexion is used to describe how bent an athlete’s throwing arm is. Making a right angle with your elbow is 90 degrees. Performing a bicep curl action increases the angle to over 90 degrees, while straightening the elbow decreases the angle to under 90 degrees. Not surprisingly, elbow flexion at MER is describing how bent the athlete’s elbow is at max layback. When looking at the data, we found no significant difference between the pink and the black balls. However, there was a significant difference between the green and pink and between the green and black balls. This means that athletes on average exhibited a higher degree of elbow flexion at MER with the black and pink balls compared to the green ball.
It should be noted that while there may be a significant difference between the green and pink/black balls, this difference may be negligible in terms of throwing velocity performance. When we look at max elbow flexion as it relates to mound throwing velocity across ranges of 70 – 96+ mph, there seems to be a sweet spot somewhere between 105 – 125 degrees. From the image below, we can see a slow taper of throwing velocity as max elbow flexion is below 105 and greater than 125.
It should be noted some pitchers who throw at an elite velocity may fall outside of these elbow flexion ranges, but on average the majority of elite throwers seem to fall within somewhere between 105 – 125 degrees.
So, while it may seem that on average throwers exhibit less max elbow flexion at MER with the green ball compared to the pink and black balls, the amount of elbow flexion they do create at MER seems to be within a desired range, nonetheless.
The maximum elbow varus moment describes the amount of medial torque (measured in newtons) the elbow joint is exposed to throughout the throw (usually occurring around MER).  When looking at the data, there seems to be a significant difference in max elbow varus moment between the green and black balls, while we found no significant difference between the pink and black and between the green and pink.
It is possible this significant difference between the green and black balls may be explained by the increase (~ 2lbs) in ball weight.
We had quite a few surprises and takeaways when we examined this data. First and foremost, our initial hypothesis seemed to be wrong in that MER, or max layback, on average was unaffected and not significantly different between all three balls. Naturally, there will be some athletes who may struggle to achieve layback with any ball, based on variables such as strength levels and familiarity with each ball or drill, but it seems incorrect to assume that an athlete will exhibit a ‘pushy’ arm action with less layback by throwing a ball 2 lbs or heavier. I think we could reach a similar conclusion regarding shoulder abduction, or elbow height, at MER.
I believe an interesting discussion could be had regarding SHA (maximally and at MER), elbow flexion, and maximum elbow varus moment.
When discussing max SHA, or scap retraction, athletes on average achieved a greater degree maximally as ball weight decreased. This may indicate that athletes who struggle to achieve an adequate degree of scap retraction may benefit more from throwing the green ball as compared to the pink and black. In the future, I believe these results may warrant further investigation to identify if this relationship between scap retraction and ball weight within the pivot pick drill continues while throwing the lighter Plyo Ball ® balls (blue, red, yellow, and gray). This could have further implications for program individualization.
Furthermore, this investigation showed that athletes throwing the green Plyo Ball ® held their scap retraction a bit longer into MER when compared to the pink and black balls. In other words, athletes throwing the green ball displayed less of an elbow dominant (think dart throw) type throw. This relationship can likely be partially explained by athletes achieving a higher degree of maximal scap retraction with the green ball.
When discussing max elbow flexion in isolation, as mentioned previously, athletes throwing all three balls exhibited elbow flexion within desirable ranges. That is to say, regardless of ball weight, presentations such as forearm flyout did not seem to occur. That being said, because on average athletes throwing the black and pink balls did present with greater flexion than the green, I think there could be an argument made that athletes who severely struggle with getting into proper elbow flexion positions could benefit from throwing the pink and black, slightly more than the green ball. A possible explanation could be that the heavier pink and black balls allow athletes to feel that more flexed position slightly more clearly than they can with the 2 lb green ball.
When examining maximum elbow varus moment, we found a significant difference between the green and black balls, specifically. One can likely argue that this finding could have some rehabilitation and on-ramp implications for athletes. Perhaps there is some benefit to limiting the amount of black ball exposure for athletes in the early stages of rehab and on-ramping, as the varus torques seem to be lower for the green and pink balls. Then, potentially later on in the program, you could gradually expose them to the higher torques imposed by the black ball as a means of throwing or torque progression.
Based on the findings of this investigation, the following table may be used as a ‘cheat sheet’ for prescribing ball weights for the pivot pickoff drill based on specific athlete presentations. As a reminder, these are just recommendations that can be used as a starting point. Individual athlete responses may warrant certain ball weight prescriptions.
The results from this investigation are really interesting. To me, I think it really exemplifies that athlete individualization does not have to come in the form of 30+ drills or drill variations.  Sometimes athlete individualization can simply come down to ball weight used. The table above, when used as a starting point, shows that there is utility for all ball weights. And, like all things, each ball is a tool that deserves a place in our coaching tool box.

Pitch Design: What is Stuff+? Quantifying Pitches with Pitch Models,2021-12-14T00:23:33+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/12/what-is-stuff-quantifying-pitches-with-pitch-models/,"By Chris Langin, Pitching Trainer
The art of “pitching” has many variables associated with it, some easily quantifiable and others not so much. Every pitcher, coach, and organization is constantly in a battle of weighting these variables in a manner that maximizes development and performance on the field.
While there is little agreement on how important “secondary” variables such as deception and sequencing are towards generating outs, it is generally accepted that three pitcher talents stand out above the rest.
The ability to:
These three traits come with the bonus of being rather easy to quantify at the MLB level. We don’t necessarily need a radar gun, nor a pitch model (explained below) to let us know that Aroldis Chapman has a good fastball.
However, given the innate bias associated with human evaluators, it’s likely that a pitch model can more reliably detect a 40-grade fastball from a 45-grade one than an evaluator working alone and without data. Ideally, the combination of strong baseball savvy mixed with a well-regarded model grants us the most optimal evaluation of location agnostic pitch quality.
The Pitch Model we reference at Driveline is known as “Stuff+” and is currently going through it’s 4th iteration. As mentioned above, the model filters out plate locations (thus characteristics of command which is measured in a separate metric) and primarily concerns itself with the following ballflight metrics:
The main influencers are the first three descriptors mentioned: velocity, vertical break, and horizontal break — though, we’ll discuss the need to ensure arm slot context is taken into account — along with extreme release extension values.
The need to account for interactions between these variables may not be immediately apparent given that more movement and velocity often lead to a higher quality pitch. However, there are particular instances where certain pitches break that handy rule of thumb.
For example, more velocity on breaking balls often comes with a tradeoff in glove side action. A sinker that gains vertical break usually drops in effectiveness, whereas a generic four-seamer that gains vertical break gets an uptick in effectiveness.
When developing offerings in the offseason, the ability for an athlete and coach to use Stuff+ to immediately summarize a 79-mph slider with more movement against an 83-mph gyro-esque slider is quite valuable. Perhaps the deviation in stuff+ between the 2 offerings is large enough to settle on one of the offerings with minimal bandwidth allocation towards improving or changing on particular pitch.
Stuff+ is scaled similarly to IQ — with a score of “100” meaning that pitch graded out as league average relative to other pitches thrown in that pitch type bucket. A fastball with a Stuff+ of 75 would be 25% below the league average for fastballs. A curveball with a Stuff+ of 130 would be 30% above the league average amongst all breaking balls.
The seven “popularized” pitch types are rearranged into three distinct pitch buckets — with those pitch types competing amongst each other within their associated pitch grouping.
It’s important to keep in mind that these pitches compete amongst each other—breaking balls tend to lower run values more than Fastballs, meaning a four-seamer with a Stuff+ of 150 is not necessarily equivalent in “raw stuff” to a slider with a Stuff+ of 150.
Without further ado, let’s see some examples of Stuff+ in action.
Highest graded four-seamer in 2021 (that was a strike)
Chapman is well regarded for having perhaps the most electric arm the world has ever seen.  Of the top 10 graded fastballs this season, he owned 8 of them. His 101.5+ mph throws are outrageous outliers, as they are thrown 4 miles per hour harder than 95th percentile four-seam velocity (97.6).
In the example above, these hurlers deviate significantly in how they obtain their near league average four-seam fastballs. Bard is among the league leaders in spin and fastball velocity, but suffers from significant inadvertent cut at release.
The result is a pitch that is left with rather unremarkable movement characteristics relative to competing fastballs across the league. Fiers has thrown 51% heaters across his 10-year major league career despite averaging 89.4 miles per hour. He obtains significant total movement on his heater, giving him a heater that ranks around league average when he cranks it up into the low 90s.

Four-Seam quality is predominantly a result of two things: velocity and vertical break. If you combine Bard’s velocity with Mike Fiers movement profile, you more or less get Michael Kopech, who ranked 2nd in the league in Stuff+ on his four-seamer at 225.
Arm side run, or even cut, does play a role in the potential of the offering — with pitchers that are at either extreme generally grading out more favorably. Gerrit Cole is an example (1st in Stuff+) of a pitcher who obtains significant arm side run and carry — whereas Clayton Kershaw has been a beneficiary of high carry combined with cutting action on his heater for years.
Bummer is in a class of his own when it comes to left-handed Sinkers. His 191 Stuff+ average not only leads the league for sinkers, but it is 57 points better than the next best left-handed sinker (Gregory Soto). Bummer accomplishes this with 90th percentile velocity from the left side and the ability to manipulate the pitch (largely through seam shifted wake) so that it moves in just a lateral direction — resulting in a pitch that averages less than an inch of carry.
Sinkers differentiate from four-seamers in many ways. The most obvious is that the sinker’s value is tied towards generating low run value contact in the form of ground balls. An average four-seamer will likely outweigh a “good” sinker in its ability to generate whiffs, but it won’t necessarily outweigh it in its ability to negate runs. The model currently is agnostic towards how the movement is created (spin-induced vs. non-magnus) ; it only cares that the movement and velocity is generated in some manner.
GB%'s based upon lift and velocity.Obvious trend here VB wise in obtaining ground balls.  Elite Velo (96+) tends to induce more batted balls on the ground relative to average velo if we hold movement profile constant.  This trend is present in four-seamers w/ carry as well. pic.twitter.com/7F56phSyYG
Our Stuff+ model allows us to put four-seamers and sinkers on the same scale, allowing us to rank them independent of their differing run prevention characteristics.
Joe Kelly’s sinker is similar to the Bard example above in that its above average rating (113) is almost completely accounted for by its velocity (97.7). Kelly does at least achieve above average arm side run, but his average sinker doesn’t identify as having a unique movement profile due to its lack of depth. As the pitch has an additional inch of carry relative to the league average sinker.
Dillon Tate, who didn’t even begin throwing the pitch until 2019, is able to generate a significant amount of depth on the pitch (88th percentile), along with above average arm side run (77th). When you add in his velocity (95.5) it’s a bit easier to understand why the offering rates 32 units ahead of Kelly’s (145).
Fastballs also require us to look at arm slot context prior to providing a final judgement – our model is aware of the effect slot deviation has on stuff as well.
While Snell beats Hader handedly in all the key metrics we’ve discussed for the four-seamer — Hader’s ability to impart well above average carry and velocity on his four-seamer with one of the lowest arm slots in the league proves superior.
If we bin pitchers by 0.2 feet increments, we can see that pitcher’s with Snell’s slot (6.5’+) generally come equipped with more carry on their pitches. While it’s difficult to explain precisely why pitchers who defy their release expectation receive a benefit, we know they do.
Pitchers who have lower slots are able to throw pitches with flatter vertical approach angles relative to their high slot peers. However, Stuff+ isn’t concerned with command nor targeting strategy — which has a large impact in how a hurler benefits from that advantage. Thus, deception can be assumed the main culprit for why pitcher’s such as Hader defy their raw velocity and pitch movement metrics.
We have moved on from fastballs and are now onto the breaking ball pitch groupings. Cutters, Sliders, and Curveballs are lumped together and evaluated simply off of their ball flight and release characteristics.
This is a good reminder that we’re simply discussing the context of a pitcher’s “stuff” as opposed to leveraging an entire arsenal and having a differing intent behind each pitch. This context is of utmost importance prior to diving into cutters – as they’re on the same scale as curveballs and sliders.
In the example of Clase and Alvarado, we can see that they each achieve elite scores in different fashions. Essentially, Clase is throwing a more traditional cutter, with four more inches of sweep  and absurd velocity. Alvarado, who nearly matches Clase’s stuff score on this pitch, is throwing essentially a league average slider… at 94 miles per hour from the left-hand side! The edge visualization provides good context, as Alvarado’s drops far more than the league average cutter – essentially acting like a gyro ball.
Eovaldi throws a more traditional back spinning cutter. The pitch ranked about average (104) amongst breaking balls this year – though it’s role in the arsenal was apparent, as it was mixed in at about the same rate as his CH, SL, and CB – offerings often more associated with missing bats than generating contact. Greene has more of a “hybrid” cutter in that it has slider sweep mixed with cutter carry… with the velocity (87.4) right in between the average cutter and slider velocity for a RHP. He also leverages a swing and miss breaking ball (SL; 166 Stuff+) 28% of the time.
Thus, the Cutter is highly contextual, with the maximization of stuff not necessarily being the highest priority. That being said, hurlers who are developing or fine tuning a cutter may be curious as to whether or not their pitch plays best when leaning into a Shane Greene sweeper type cutter or sticking with the back spinner that Eovaldi throws. This is where Stuff+ comes in handy, as very slight manipulations can turn a Cutter with a stuff+ of 75 into one that is 100 without it just becoming a slider.
It’s no secret that the slider has become “the best pitch in baseball” across the league. Run values back up this theory, and usage of the offering has gone up drastically over the past 2 decades.  The average slider had a Stuff+ of 119 in 2021, 25 points higher than the average cutter.
2021 MLB Averages
Tanner Scott was the Stuff+ king (246) for sliders this season… closely trailed by supination sensation Dillon Maples (233). Scott largely is the beneficiary of unheard of velocity from the left side (88.5) and the ability to often top spin breakers without a significant loss of velocity – essentially turning them into 88+ mph slurves at times.
Sliders are generally a bit more straightforward – some pitcher’s need to balance the shape of the pitch amongst the remainder of their arsenal, but oftentimes the remaining breaking pitches are fit around the slider, which tends to be most pitchers optimal whiff-inducer (especially to same handed hitters).
Wheeler has more of an  “overpowering” slider. In the pitch to Freeman, the movement is beginning to mimic that of a cutter… though the elite velocity allows it to maintain its status as a well above average breaking ball (140). Wisler, who is known for being a one trick pony with his slider, has more of a finesse offering. While he trails Wheeler by 13 ticks on this specific pitch, he has more than 4 times the sweep and less carry.
Sliders have as much movement deviation across the league as any pitch type. With whiff-inducing breaking balls being such a priority these days, stuff+ ensures that we get our athletes as close to their optimal breaker as possible – given current publicly available ball flight and release metrics.
Curveballs, the most traditional form of a breaking ball, are our last breaking ball of interest. This pitch differs greatly in arsenals – with some acting primarily as get me overs, and others acting as the core putaway pitch.
We once again witness the benefits of being left-handed here. Pomeranz’s curveball is quite unique, as it grades out significantly better than Shane McClanahan’s CB, who ranks 2nd amongst lefties. Kelly’s curveball is essentially wizardry given his unexplainable ability to impart cutter-esque velocity to the pitch while still obtaining elite depth.
Over the course of the season, Kelly averaged league average curveball movement, but threw the pitch 7.5 ticks firmer than the average righty. Pomeranz is able to achieve a bit more of a “downer” profile – meaning the pitch has 12-6 action relative to the league average curveball.
Since his memorable strikeout of Carlos Beltran in the 2006 NLCS, Adam Wainwright has been known for having one of the biggest benders in the game. He picked up 225 called strikes with it during the 2021 season. While the pitch essentially omits velocity (6.3 ticks slower on average than a RH CB) it makes up for it with an outlier combination of depth (17.2”) and sweep (17.4”). In the example above, Harvey is throwing more of a “gyro curve” with the velocity (82.2 mph) helping make up for the loss in movement – allowing it to rank about league average amongst breaking balls.
Context of the remaining arsenal is a heavy consideration for every curveball. Even so, some suffer from a lack of experimentation, as pitchers with a Stuff+ model in front of them may learn they don’t have to be quite so strict with the spin direction of the offering, or may simply learn that the pitch plays better with more of a gyroscopic shape.
Our final pitch grouping is “offspeed” which consists simply of changeups and splitters. We actually group these pitches together when analyzing them – as the role of a splitter and a changeup is generally the same. Additionally, pitcher’s pairing both of them in the arsenal is relatively rare in the states.
Prior to continuing, we should contextualize that offspeed effectiveness is based on the differential from the fastball. This means that instead of looking at individual velocity and break values, we should look at these metrics relative to the fastball. We will add an additional table and take fastball + sinker averages and negate that from a pitcher’s offspeed metrics.
On average, pitcher’s drop 8 ticks off their fastball, add nearly three and a half inches of arm side run, and generate 8 inches of depth relative to their average fastball.
Devin Williams “airbender” is among the games most famous pitches. Offspeed “stuff” evaluation is arguably the most  difficult of the groupings we’ve discussed – what we do know is that looking to add depth on the pitch tends to be a worthwhile investment – as most of the game’s best changeups are approaching or exceed 15+ inches of vertical separation off their fastball.
This example may better bring to light the need to contextualize the changeup/splitter off of a pitcher’s fastball metrics. Cotton’s CH is equipped with 7 more inches of carry relative to Mills, but receives a grade double that of Mills. This is due to the fact Mills throws a heavy proportion of sinkers, which in a sense, chokes out the potential of his changeup.
With Stuff+, and thus the Blob tool inside TRAQ, we can project how much adding in a high volume of sinkers into a pitcher’s arsenal would hinder their changeup. For pitcher’s such as Mills, it’s entirely possible further development of the changeup isn’t all that possible, as his changeup is dropping a rather impressive 12 inches relative to the average metrics of his four-seamer.
Finally, we’ll briefly mention release extension. While it isn’t of extraordinary importance, pitcher’s that deviate greatly from league average’s will certainly receive a boost (or penalty) due its influence on reaction time for the hitter.
When accounting for flight time differential, an additional foot of release extension is worth the equivalent of 1.6 mph.  Though, relatively few big leaguers deviate by more than half a foot relative to the league average – hence it’s light influence  in a majority of hurlers’ arsenals.
Stuff+ can be counterproductive if abused. It should not be thought of as a replacement for any additional pitch quality analysis. We must remember that Stuff+ is location agnostic and looks at pitches individually. Good baseball intuition is still required to contextualize whether or not simply maximizing the stuff+ on a given pitcher’s cutter is optimal for their specific arsenal.
Stuff+ takes away some bias from the equation and provides a strong summary score for how a pitch rates based on its pitch flight characteristics and release parameters. Stuff+’s biggest strength is that it captures this without a need for a massive sample size – allowing for immediate feedback during pitch designs in the offseason.
When utilized properly, Stuff+ is an invaluable tool – there’s simply too much variability in breaking ball shapes and their differing effectiveness  to simply look at percentile rankings amongst the big three metrics (velo, vertical break, horizontal break) and assume an accurate model. Stuff+ contextualizes when added carry is good on a slider, and when you should be nudged towards a sinker instead of a four-seamer.

Pulse Throw App Updates - Driveline Baseball,2021-11-30T01:48:29+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/11/pulse-throw-app-updates/,"By Kyle Lindley, PULSE Product Manager
Two new features were added to PULSE Throw iOS version 8.8:
We are constantly working to make your workload management experience as simple, robust, and pain-free as possible—this time, we’ve added battery level indicators to show if the sensor needs to be charged so data does not get missed, as well as an easier way to add workload data to an athlete’s profile if they throw without their sensor.
After you open the PULSE Throw app and go to an athlete profile, you should see a red outline of a sensor with a gray ‘X’ in it, showing that a sensor is not currently connected to the phone. After connecting a sensor, the sensor icon will show how much battery is left.
Based on the number of bars in the sensor icon, you can determine if there is enough charge to get through the throwing workout without charging:
Full: 5 – 8 hours of use remaining*
Sufficient: 3 – 5 hours of use remaining*
Low: 1-2 hours of use remaining*
Critical: < 45 min of use remaining*
Critical: No battery left, charge before throwing
*Battery life time estimates are based on new and slightly used sensors. Battery life capacity decreases over the lifetime of the sensor.
Note: Any time the sensor is off the charger, it is powered on and the battery will lose charge. To keep the sensor at full charge it must be left on the charger.
You can now copy a previous day’s data to a later date. This feature was added to make it easier to fill in missing workload data if an athlete is unable to wear their sensor for a throwing session or if the sensor does not capture throws.
Example: You’re an athlete and today you threw Plyo Ball ® and longtoss, but you forgot your sensor at home. This is a common throwing routine for you on your low intensity days, so last week you completed an almost identical routine. Instead of missing out on today’s workload data, you can copy your similar workout from last week to today’s date, which serves as a good estimate for today’s workload.
How to add workload to a day of throwing:
If you have any feedback on these new features or the rest of the PULSE Throw app, please contact [email protected] to let us know what you think!

Thomas Ruwe: From not pitching in High School to throwing 98 MPH,2021-11-24T02:34:18+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/11/thomas-ruwe-from-not-pitching-in-high-school-to-throwing-98-mph/,"By Chris Langin, Pitching Trainer
“Why don’t you just play basketball?”
This question followed Thomas Ruwe growing up. There’s not exactly a surplus of 6 foot 7 inch human beings in the state of Nebraska, and given an unimpressive start to his baseball career, the hypothesis was he wasn’t participating in a sport that best leveraged his genetic gifts.
“The main reason I didn’t play basketball is because I never really loved it,” said Ruwe. “Another reason was I had a chest condition that affected my breathing. I had to have surgery on it before my senior year of high school. They literally put a metal bar in my chest and it stayed there until my second year of junior college.”
If the video doesn’t do it justice, the statistics, or lack thereof, suggested that Ruwe’s baseball career wouldn’t last long. He had one career varsity outing during his high school career and a fastball that never eclipsed 75 miles per hour.
“There were a lot of frustrations in high school,” said Ruwe. “It seemed like I was always battling some sort of injury. I really was not very good. The only reason I even had a varsity outing was because I couldn’t play on junior varsity as a senior.”
For most, after getting one sympathetic varsity outing in their high school career, the thought of playing college baseball wouldn’t even register. Ruwe had two things going for him, though.
For one, he was 6’7” and still growing. Second, and perhaps most vital, colleges are always in need of extra bodies to contribute toward their tuition costs.
“I remember going on a few college visits, but I wasn’t getting recruited for baseball. I was just going to see the campus and potentially walk on. Eventually, I reached out to the coach at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa. The coach sat me down and told me if I came there I would have to work my tail off because I would get redshirted immediately.”
Ellsworth was coming off a 17-win-season and couldn’t foresee a way that Ruwe could help them the following season. Ruwe, having literally no leverage to play elsewhere, enrolled at Ellsworth and began his college career.
“The first year at Ellsworth was full of a lot of realizing how much I needed to improve in order to compete at the junior college level. I only threw around 74 mph my first year.”
Following the redshirt season, Ruwe finally got an opportunity to display his talents in the spring of 2015. He managed a 9.85 ERA and walked 29 batters against 23 strikeouts in 28.1 innings pitched. His fastball velocity was in the high 70’s.
“I had a lot of walks and gave up a lot of runs, but for some reason I was adamant I could play at that level.”
He followed up that 2015 campaign by breaking his back into two places. As a result, he spent six months in a back brace. Ruwe wouldn’t throw a single pitch during the 2016 season. Every time he pitched during his third season his back got a little more sore.
“It wasn’t until my mom came and watched me throw in front of some scouts that I realized I had been pushing it too far,” Ruwe said. “I came off the mound and tried to sit in the dugout and essentially collapsed from pain in my back.”
Now a 4th year sophomore, Ruwe transferred to the University of Nebraska-Kearney and managed to earn a $1000 scholarship.
“When I got to UNK, I was just happy to be there. Happy to still be playing the game. I don’t think coaches had a lot of expectations for me… hell, I had little expectations for me,” Ruwe said.
During 2017, Ruwe was healthy enough to pitch, but was rarely needed. He wasn’t on the travel squad most weekends, and he once again walked more hitters than he struck out. He put up a 10.54 ERA.
Through four years of college, Ruwe’s best two seasons were likely the ones he spent redshirted. He had a career ERA north of 10, had walked 40 batters against just 33 strikeouts, and had suffered significant injuries.
“Ruwe was anywhere from 82 to 87 and struggled to throw strikes consistently,” said Andrew Riddell, who pitched with Ruwe at Nebraska-Kearney. “He was coming off previous back surgeries and couldn’t do the same workouts as the other guys on the roster and didn’t throw many innings at all. I thought his career would be over after college, as did many more.”
In 2018, he finally had some success, putting up a 4.35 ERA and striking out more batters than he walked for the first time in his career. He touched 90 for the first time during that fall, though he still sat around 84-86. Nonetheless, he was 23 years old. His story seemed destined to max out as going from a junior college walk on to an average Division II reliever.
“In the fall of my second year at Kearney, I would be ecstatic about throwing 88 and the prospect of touching 90 seemed a lot more intriguing, and I started putting more value in that. This may or may not have been because my college teammate Chris Langin—who was also my roommate—was into Driveline and their products early on, but to be honest I was still skeptical of the program at that time,” Ruwe said.
Nebraska-Kearney’s baseball program was cut following 2018. Ruwe transferred to Missouri Western for his 6th and final season of college. He put up his best season, striking out 41 against just 10 walks. Which is what you’d hope for from someone 2-3 years older than the average player on the field. He converted from reliever to starter halfway through the season, but suffered an arm injury right before the conference tournament.
“Once I got to Missouri Western, it was another challenge getting acclimated to a new program and a new pitching coach,” said Ruwe. “My arm slot slowly got lower and lower. We didn’t really use radar guns at Missouri Western, so I never really knew exactly how hard I was throwing. On the rare occasion we pulled it out, I was around 84-89.”
Following the arm injury he suffered prior to the conference tournament, Ruwe was pulled aside and told in no uncertain terms to “pitch through it,” seeing as he wouldn’t have a career after college.
“By the time I left Missouri Western, I had a busted arm and a busted love for baseball… but I stood on the field at the conference tournament and promised myself I wasn’t done yet,” Ruwe said.
Unfortunately, Ruwe wasn’t coming off a mild case of elbow inflammation. He was diagnosed with a partially torn UCL during the summer. He got a Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injection, which you aren’t exactly guaranteed to come back from, and wouldn’t be ready for 100% intensity for six months.
He was now 24-years-old, had a partially torn UCL, topping out at 91 on the best of days, and was coming off an average season against a bunch of 21-year-olds at a Division II school in the Midwest.
While he was adamant that he would continue trying to play following the conference tournament, some realities of life were becoming apparent.
“It really was a back and forth trying to decide if it even made sense for me to continue. I debated it a lot and there was a period where I almost decided it wasn’t for me. I worked on my family farm to help my dad in the summer. I didn’t find out what was wrong with my arm until the middle of June.”
As cliche as it sounds, Ruwe felt there was still “something whispering in my ear that I wasn’t done yet.”
“After saving up every bit that I could and a few frantic conversation with Julianne (now his wife) and Chris, I purchased my Driveline subscription and prepared to drive across the country with not much more than a dream and a belief that there was more left for me to give in my baseball career.”
In March 2020, Ruwe began his training at Driveline. It started off great; he hit 92 for the first time in his career.

But before the end of his first week, the COVID-19 pandemic closed down the Driveline facility.
“I was at Driveline for three days and had gotten one lifting session in when Chris called me and told me that Driveline was shutting down to in-gym athletes because of COVID policies. I went to train with an old summer ball teammate in the area who had a place for me to sleep and we trained together for a month while I waited to see if Driveline would open back up.”
“I drove back home to continue training at the facility in Fremont, Nebraska with Steve (his trainer since high school),” said Ruwe. “There I saw 95 off the mound for the first time in my career. In an empty gym, with no music playing, just a few high schoolers holding radar guns and Steve recording. I was performing my drop steps and walking windups as part of my online training with the annual plan and sending videos to Chris.”

During the summer, Driveline opened up a pop-up shop in Arizona. Ruwe traveled there and finally threw on radar tech for the first time in his career. There, Ruwe had his first pleasant surprise in his career. He was possibly the best in the world at spinning a fastball.
It still wasn’t all that good.
“We got to see my numbers on Rapsodo for the first time and learned that I could spin the ball really well. However, I was missing out on a ton of vertical and horizontal break because my efficiency was hovering around 70%. I was missing out on close to 1000 RPMs, rendering the skill of being able to spin the ball that well rather useless.”
The pitch didn’t have what you’d call “useful” cut for a fastball. It wasn’t getting true glove side action (think Corbin Burnes), much less relative cut (think Max Fried). While he could spin the ball over 3000 RPMs, he was getting less total movement than the average big league pitcher. Even when he maxed out in velocity, at 94-95 mph, he was still throwing a pitch that graded out nearly 50% below the average big league fastball.
The good news? You can’t really teach someone to impart that much raw spin on a fastball. But, you can teach them how to put a higher proportion of that spin towards useful movement. While getting the velocity up to a level that could get him signed was still of chief interest, we kept a keen eye on how his spin efficiency was progressing on the heater. A good portion of throwing economy went towards reps with Rapsodo feedback, providing cues that would enhance his efficiency.
We knew his raw RPMs would go down a bit, as inadvertent cut increases raw RPMs on fastballs (controlling for velocity change). For reference, of pitchers that averaged over 2500 RPMs on their four-seamers in 2021, the average spin efficiency was 84%, 8% below the big league average of 92%. But again, maximizing raw spin isn’t the end goal for maximizing the effectiveness of a fastball.
“That became a big goal, along with putting on more weight,” said Ruwe, “My lowest hanging fruits, if you will.”
The Washington Driveline opened up again in July 2020 and Ruwe could finally get his strength assessment in.
Historically a “hard gainer,” Ruwe had struggled for years to put on weight. His back issues had prevented him from doing many core lifts that most pitchers had no issues executing. Despite being 6’9”, his bodyweight wasn’t reliably above 200 pounds throughout his college career.
“I have always been trying to gain weight, but for so long I was also growing and wasn’t done developing into my adult body until I was almost 23,” Ruwe said.
When Ruwe went through his first strength assessment in July of 2020, his Squat Jump Peak Power (strongest correlator in HP dataset to velocity) of 4,770 watts was more than a standard deviation below his peers in the 90+ mph group. His force plate numbers were rather pathetic, with absolute and relative strength ranking in just the 2nd and 3rd percentile respectively amongst 90+ mph peers.
“I got back to Seattle after a month in Arizona and was putting more training economy into the weight room. I gained about 10 pounds and was moving really well down the mound during my lower intensity throwing. I used to think gaining weight was super difficult because I wasn’t eating enough.”Ruwe tried lots of things to gain weight, downing chocolate milk and eating ramen every night.“The game changer was when I started tracking my calories and made it a priority,” Ruwe said. “Knowing that my weight gain would have a big correlation to my gains on the mound…It forced me to own it or go home.”
Just 77 days later, he had gained nearly 1,000 watts on his jumps. His peak power had gone from being comparable to an average 19-year-old junior college pitcher to being firmly in the middle of the 90+ group. He had gotten up to 97 on his grey drop steps during his “end of week” throws.
“They gave me 3-5 throws to “let it eat” at high intensity at the end of each week, and I really looked forward to that. Other than that, they delegated everything towards getting stronger in the weight room.”
His relative and absolute strength improved significantly as well. Relative to 90+ mph throwers, Ruwe went from being in the 3rd and 2nd percentile in absolute and relative strength to the 57th and 33rd percentile over those two and a half months. A quick peek at his radar chart speaks for itself.
Based on our HP database, even if Ruwe were to not have had any improvements to his throwing mechanics, we’d expect a 2.9 MPH gain just because of the gains he made on the high performance side.
“The biggest thing in the weight room strength-wise was never running another pole since college,” Ruwe joked. “Realistically, just being on a schedule that was conducive to my throwing volume was the biggest thing. Prior to Driveline, I never prioritized recovering and didn’t match up my throwing well with my lifting.”
About a week before his September retest, on August 29th, Ruwe had a career changing day. During his “end of week” throws, he was feeling pretty good (and to be honest, he made a few more throws than the five he was prescribed, but dammit if it wasn’t for good reason).
Not everyday you see a 6’9″ human being performing a 🔥🔥🔥 Drop Step that isn’t in the low post. @ruwe_1995 pic.twitter.com/NrVikn6T0f
He took home four velo records at Driveline. The 225g step back, and all the drop step records except for the 450g ball. While it wasn’t a baseball, he saw triple digits on the radar gun for the first time in his life.
“Seeing triple digits light up on the radar gun for the first time was a top three feeling in my life, behind marrying my wife and my first professional save,” Ruwe said. “Getting my name on the record wall at Driveline was kind of the culmination of so much hardship and struggle and finally seeing some actual evidence of the work paying off.”
Following the conclusion of Ruwe’s strength phase, it was time to see if the velocity would convert to the 5 ounce baseball off the mound.
At this point, enough moderate intensity Rapsodo work had been done that he was no longer inadvertently cutting his fastball. There were still issues with it, specifically that it was in the “dead zone,” but his spin was significant enough to offset some vulnerabilities that come with that type of fastball. Nonetheless, every tick he could get on his fastball would be needed to get signed.
In his motion capture retest, he destroyed his previous personal best off the mound. He sat 95-96, peaking at 96.8, just a tenth of a tick below the record in the lab for 230+ pound pitchers.

Compared to his initial motion capture in March, he saw significant improvements in nearly all variables that are associated with increases in velocity—specifically, his kinematic velocities.
Throughout his first athlete meeting, the biggest points of interest were improving elbow flexion and hip-shoulder separation.
3-13-2020: Max: 103, FP: 85
9-10-2020: Max: 120, FP: 98
3-13-2020: Max: 2370
9-10-2020: Max: 2650
Elbow flexion plays a moderate role in enhancing a pitcher’s ability to increase the velocity at which they extend their elbow. Ruwe increased his max elbow flexion by 17 degrees. Throughout the entire dataset, the r value between max elbow flexion and max elbow extension angular velocity is 0.33. When looking at intra-athlete correlations, the r value is still 0.18. That’s enough to emphasize it given its teachability and its impact on increasing elbow extension velocity, one of the stronger correlations to ball velocity in the entire dataset.
3-13-2020: 180
9-10-2020: 192
Ruwe also increased how much shoulder external rotation (layback) he got in the throw. While it’s foolish for anyone to try to say exactly which portion of the training improved this, we know that external rotation is extremely valuable for producing ball velocity, as it allows the athlete to apply force to the baseball for a longer period of time.
Ruwe certainly wasn’t hurt by his increase in elbow flexion here, as it is generally easier to get into more external rotation when pulling back a shorter lever. His elbow flexion improved at max ER as well, when that would appear to be most useful for enhancing this range of motion.
Admittedly, and an excellent case study in the need to be vulnerable in your initial assessment, Ruwe actually lost hip-shoulder separation despite throwing four miles per hour harder. While his drills were tailored towards enhancing this separation, it didn’t happen. With the history of his back issues, it’s possible that his back was a limiting factor. That said, he found another way to generate elite velocity despite being told 6 months prior that improving hip-shoulder separation would be vital in his pursuit of 95+.
This points to the value of self-organization rather than prescribing exact mechanical changes. If the athlete sees improvement without improving mechanically in departments you inferred would aid in their velocity development, your priors should be updated.
At the end of the day, the gains in the weight room likely attributed to most of the improvement in Ruwe’s velocity during that 6-month window.
After a couple weeks of getting back a feel for the slope, Ruwe was ready to showcase his arsenal. He had just turned 25 and the 2020 MLB off-season had begun. Despite the unbelievable gains he had made over the last 6 months, he still needed to put on a clinic to have a chance at getting signed.
MiLB teams were getting cut, and the lack of a minor league season didn’t offer any opportunities for pitchers in organizations to pitch themselves out of a job. His college statistics were brutal, and nobody knew what his command would look like with an additional 10 miles per hour behind his pitches.
After generating some initial interest by sitting 96-97, a Brewers scout was sent to watch Ruwe pitch a week later. Everything clicked, with him sitting 96-97 again, and setting another personal best in velocity, this time at 97.9.
Top Heaters from @ruwe_1995 yesterday. Came to Driveline in March and set a PR at 92.9 during his motion capture… things seem to be going… well. Reliably ~29-3000 RPM’s on the Fastball during this + previous bullpens. @FlatgroundApp pic.twitter.com/KZXySP5SZu
“Throwing in front of the Brewers scout was a mix of emotions. I was excited that a scout finally, for the first time in my career, took interest in me. It was also nerve-racking because that was the only team looking into me.”
A week later, Ruwe had created a bit of leverage with his performances. With multiple teams in the running, he wound up signing a professional contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. The kid who couldn’t break 90 miles per hour two years prior, and was recovering from a partial UCL tear a year ago, was now inking an affiliate contract at 25-years-old with a $20,000 signing bonus.
While the impossible had happened for Ruwe, there was still work that needed to be done to increase the probabilities he could climb up the system.
That started with fixing that dead zone fastball.
“Chris had mentioned his concerns with my fastball profile previously, but felt to make changes we’d need a decent amount of time in a stress-free environment. Seeing as I was trying to get signed, that wasn’t the time to make that change,”
To get Ruwe out of the dead zone, he’d have to change the spin direction of his fastball. Re-patterning the throw like this is seldom practical. The benefits that come with a more over the top slot (for those stuck in the dead zone) are quite obvious—and, undoubtedly, more people would attempt this if success rates were high. Anecdotally, significant manipulation of anterior trunk tilt like this often leads to an unnatural movement for an athlete, thus risking a decrease in velocity.
However, when you’re 25-years-old and not anywhere near a prospect, you have little to lose. This made Ruwe an optimal candidate for experimentation.
Torso anterior tilt essentially “sets” up an athlete’s arm slot. The more extended they are at foot plant (over the heels), generally the higher their release height. In the GIFs above, the athlete’s respective slots are decided by their torso position at foot plant. As the torso rotates towards the plate to deliver the ball, the arm will follow behind, with the eventual result being an arm slot that stays on that same plane throughout release.
Our data fits this logic. Nearly 20% of the variability in vertical break between athletes in our database can be explained by their torso anterior tilt at foot plant.
Given Ruwe’s history of being nudged toward a sidearm delivery, there was some confidence that selling out for a higher three-quarters slot was a possibility. To date, his velocity was increasing with the more traditional three-quarter slot he was throwing from. His release height, because of his 81-inch height and 86-inch wingspan, was already relatively high (~6.3-6.4 feet) relative to big league averages (6 feet), which presented no unique benefits for his current fastball characteristics.
Looking at historical MLB data, and controlling for intra-pitcher changes in release height, a linear model would project that an increase of 1 inch in release height would cause an increase of 0.25 inches of vertical break on average.
The ultimate practical example is Justin Verlander.
Verlander improved the whiff rate on his fastball considerably, with no drastic increases in velocity, spin, or spin efficiency. The spin direction of the fastball had simply adjusted upward an additional 15-20 minutes, resulting in nearly three extra inches of carry.
After an off-season of video feedback, Rapsodo feedback, and cueing, Ruwe was able to reliably achieve the desired shape during bullpens and live at-bat settings. However, the real challenge would be whether he’d be able to maintain the profile during the season.
Prior to heading out for his first professional season, Ruwe shattered one more Plyo Ball ® record, this time reaching back for 101 on a grey step back.
“To see where he is at now and how far he has come is unbelievable,” said Ridell. “He definitely isn’t the same pitcher who was struggling for innings at a Division II University in Nebraska… he deserves everything that his hard work has got him.”
Now it was time to compete, for the first time in 2 years.
His first season got off to a cold start. He was in A-ball, 25-years-old, and couldn’t get anybody out.
Ruwe was sent to the extended site after his first 6 outings in Low-A. His velocity was back down to the low 90’s and he was struggling to find the strike zone.
“If there was a definition of a roller coaster season, it was my first one in pro ball,” Ruwe said.
After the six-outing pit stop and getting recalled from extended, he began making quick work of hitters, striking out 27 against 9 walks over 15 and a third innings pitched. That was enough to earn him a promotion to High-A.
The success carried over to High-A, where he struck out over 42% of the batters he faced. Hitters had an OPS. of .481 against him in his nine outings in Vancouver. Ruwe put up a 42% K rate and a 1.92 FIP after being recalled on June 25th. Both were 95th percentile across A and High-A relievers with at least 25 innings over that stretch.
His stuff had returned as well. While in Vancouver, his average fastball velocity was 94.3, reaching as high as 99 on the stadium radar gun. His four-seam characteristics were also exactly what we intended them to look like when making the arm slot change.
During his time in Vancouver, his spin rate would’ve ranked 1st among major league pitchers. His 21.6 inches of total movement would be amongst the top 5, behind Jharel Cotton, Demarcus Evans, and Michael Kopech.
The pitch was synonymous with the Verlander profile discussed earlier. Ruwe’s average release height was 82.5 inches, and he induced 19.3 inches of vertical break on average. The velocity was 94.3.
Verlander’s averages? 82.8 inch release height,19.5 inches of induced vertical break, and 94.8 miles per hour.
The ball flight characteristics of the pitch were good for a stuff+ of 165, 65% above a big league average fastball. The pitch had tripled in stuff from the time it was first thrown at Driveline Arizona.
He paired that with a sweeping slider, which averaged 14 inches of sweep at 81 miles per hour, good for a stuff+ of ~130 relative to big league breaking balls.
Of Ruwe’s 49 strikeouts, he got 24 of them with the four-seamer, and 25 with the slider.
Despite the success at High-A, Ruwe is still headed towards a make or break year with the Blue Jays. He’ll be 26-years-old without a single Double-A inning to his name.
If he can finish the story, and accomplish his dreams of becoming a big leaguer, he’ll be amongst the most unlikely of the 22,000 that have donned a big league jersey.
“Throughout this journey, there were a lot of places I wanted to give up, or actually, maybe some places people would think I should have given up. If there is anything I have learned, it’s that believing in yourself and having a solid support system can get you as far as your dreams will carry you. Getting to where you need to be is listening to the voice in your head telling you to try one more time.”

Caleb Thielbar: Coaching DII Baseball to 10 million dollar season,2021-11-05T23:35:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/11/caleb-thielbar-coaching-dii-baseball-to-10-million-dollar-season/,"Caleb Thielbar was over five years removed from his last pitch at the big league level. At 33, not only was he on the wrong side of the aging curve, but the talent level of the league was continuing to rise – resulting in a larger barrier for entry. When Thielbar was drafted in 2009, average fastball velocity was just above 92 miles per hour.
10 years later, it was trending towards 94.
In 2019, Thielbar spent the season in the Detroit Tigers organization, a team with the 3rd worst record (47-114) for a Major League Team since 1952. If a betting man was to develop a scenario in which Thielbar would at least get on a major league mound again, this would’ve been the optimal one.
But the call never came.“After 2019, I was pretty satisfied that I had given it everything I had and would not get another chance,” Thielbar said. “Earlier that season I had decided to be done and take a coaching job.”Six years prior, Thielbar had to have felt on top of the world. He was just 26-years-old and had finished his first big league season with a 1.76 ERA, sixth best in the American League among pitchers with at least 40 innings.
26-year-old Randolph HS graduate and South Dakota State alumnus Caleb Thielbar made his major league debut with the #MNTwins on this date in 2013.He didn’t allow a run in his first 17 major league appearances, and finished his rookie season with a 1.76 ERA and 0.826 WHIP. pic.twitter.com/qOvzFvFeI4
The left arm that had carried him to the highest levels of baseball was now limited to writing scouting reports for Augustana University, a DII school in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
We’ve heard of pitchers battling back from the minor leagues after previously being reliable big league hurlers. Some have even come back all the way from independent ball. Thielbar had spent the past four years working between both routes—but coming back from a livelihood that comprises meeting with recruits for breakfast and holding up a Stalker radar gun to 15-17-year-old kids? Not exactly the most conventional route back to the big leagues.
But for Thielbar, most of his life has been built around overcoming odds and adversity.
Thielbar competed at Randolph High School, a 1A school in Minnesota. His graduating class was comprised of just 40 people. During his senior year of high school, he had a fastball that topped out at 77 miles per hour. There wasn’t much interest from colleges.
“Not much recruitment out of high school. I went to a showcase camp at South Dakota State and that ended up being my in there. Otherwise I was likely going to a D3 school,” Caleb Thielbar said.
South Dakota State was in the middle of transitioning into a D1 program. Even after his freshman and sophomore years, the velocity wasn’t getting past the low 80’s. His freshman year statistics are almost impossible to believe for somebody who eventually played major league baseball.
In 41.2 innings, he struck out just 11 hitters. Good for 2.38 K/9 and a putrid 6% strikeout rate. He almost struck out as many hitters as he gave up home runs (8).
For reference, over the past 15 years, there have been 5061 major league seasons with at least 40 innings pitched. Only 1 season had a pitcher with a K/9 less than the 2.38 mark Thielbar showcased his freshman year.
His first major jump came during his junior year.
“I got some video analysis by Dick Mills. It wasn’t perfect, but I learned to use my lower body better as I had been all arm up to that point. Between that and really highlighting weights hard that year, I began sitting 87-89 my junior year and started attracting pro attention,” Thielbar said.
In just two years, Thielbar more than quadrupled his strikeout rate, going from whiffing 2.38 batters per 9 to 10.27. He had gone from barely reaching double digit strikeouts in 41 innings his freshman year to punching 100 tickets his junior year.
He was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 18th round at the conclusion of his 2009 season. Still, objectively, his dreams of becoming a big leaguer were slim. Just 4%, or about 1 in every 25 pitchers who were signed between the 16th-20th round from 2008 to 2012 were worth at least 1 career WAR at the big league level.
To complicate matters more, Thielbar was released just a year into his Brewers career. Similar to high school, he wasn’t highly sought after by affiliate teams. He continued his career, taking an indy ball opportunity with the St. Paul Saints, in the American Association at time.
“My mindset after the first release was that I had been training again already and ended up getting an indy ball spot pretty quick. So I just thought I’d give it a shot and see what happened,” Thielbar said. “I ended up learning a lot from some veterans on that team and it really helped me get back to a place where I was confident and effective.”
He spent the majority of 2011 with the Saints. After 43 games, the Twins called, and he began his first stint with the organization. That’s when little went wrong for Thielbar. He ascended from High A to Triple-A in 2012 and had a tremendous rookie season in 2013. He was the first player from South Dakota State to play in the big leagues in over 100 years. In 2014, he appeared in 54 games with a 3.40 ERA and 3.55 FIP.
But in 2015, the upward trend Caleb Thielbar experienced came to a screeching halt. He went from being penciled into the Twins’ bullpen for the foreseeable future to not having a job.
“After 2014 I was happy with results but I knew something was wrong after pitching through shoulder tendinitis the whole second half,” Thielbar said. “Problem was, I didn’t know what to do other than rest and hope it got better. It carried over into 2015 and led to a frustrating year.”
Thielbar’s “stuff”, which didn’t have a massive margin for error to begin with, given his 90 mph velocity, took a nosedive. The stadium radar gun rarely started with a 9. His ability to whiff batters diminished. With little room to be picky with his pitches, the walk rate started climbing as well. His K-BB rate was barely positive, at 1.6%.
To put his K-BB rate into perspective, since 2015, only 2 qualified relievers out of over 1,000 have put up a worse K-BB rate at the big league level. Thielbar was pitching like this in the Minor Leagues at 28 years old.
His poor K-BB rate, combined with the lack of velocity, was so troublesome that he received no real interest from organizations despite his MLB contributions in 2013 and 2014. He’d be heading back to the St. Paul Saints for round two.
“After the year, Brian Garman (now a minor league coach with the Cincinnati Reds) introduced me to Driveline, and I started buying in. My shoulder finally felt better, and I was able to keep pushing through those years because I had flashes of really good stuff. I’d have an outing once in a while where I’d be 91-94, but never really put it all together consistently until the last few months of 2018. Ever since then the velo has been pretty steadily the best of my career.”
Thielbar spent the next two years with the Saints. His velo trended upward, and the strikeouts returned. The Tigers took a chance on him in 2018 and signed him to a minor league deal. Despite being 31 with multiple years of service time, Thielbar threw 38 innings in Double-A. He struck out 40 and walked just three. He ended the season in Triple-A and gave it one last hurrah in 2019.
Thielbar pitched the entirety of 2019 to no avail. Despite pitching for an MLB club with little to play for, and a historically bad season, he never got an opportunity. He struck out 94 and walked just 16 in nearly 80 innings of work, but none of them were at the big league level.
From June 1st to September 1st of that year, Thielbar had what he described as “the best 3 months” of his career.
Caleb Thielbar limited hitters to an OPS of .535 and had an ERA of 1.78 and a FIP of 2.09 over that stretch. He struck out 31% of hitters he faced and walked just 6%. His trademark 69-73 mph curveball had a near 50% whiff rate.

Over that same time span, the Detroit Tigers went 18-62. The 32-year-old had returned to the 2013 version of himself and then some. If this wasn’t enough to earn a call to the big leagues, under what would’ve seemed to be  ideal of circumstances, what would be? After going back and forth on the coaching offer he received during the season, Thielbar decided it was time to move on from playing and commit to coaching.
“Having the best 3 months of my career and not getting a call up solidified my decision,” Thielbar said.
Our new pitching coach knows a thing or two about throwing the ⚾️ around!
We are excited to welcome former Twins pitcher Caleb Thielbar to Augustana Baseball!
📖: https://t.co/m8OHb5TVCR#BuildingChampions
— Augustana Baseball (@AugieBaseball) September 12, 2019
Thielbar spent the entirety of October settling into his new role as the Augustana Pitching Coach. He had gone as far as attending recruiting events in Arizona and eating breakfast with recruits.
“The first time I met him I was taking a recruit and his parents to their campus tour,” Clay Collison said, the current Augustana pitching coach. “Caleb walked out of the building we were going into and he could definitely tell I was a baseball coach. He kinda walked away, but then turned around and was like ‘are you Clay?’ The mom had overheard him introduce himself to me. She looked at me and said ‘Caleb Thielbar? That pitched for the Twins?'”
Outside of a Major League contract, there wasn’t much that would’ve convinced Thielbar to pick up his cleats again during the winter. The one exception? An opportunity to play with Team USA.
Still unconvinced of fully committing back to baseball, Thielbar saw the opportunity as a way to go out with a bang. Plus it would only cost him a few months away from his new job.
“Getting a chance to play with team USA after the 2019 season was the thrill of my life, and I figured that would be a cool way to go out,” Thielbar said.
2019 @RocRedWings OF Brent Rooker and former LHP Caleb Thielbar are on Team USA’s #Premier12 roster. https://t.co/ovcAhGdnX1
The experience also granted Thielbar a unique opportunity to extract information for his primary job. Coaching.
“One of the things we did with Team USA while preparing to go overseas was play some college teams in Arizona,” Thielbar said. “We went down to the University of Arizona and I was able to get a meeting with Nate Yeskie (now the Texas A&M pitching coach) about coaching. Just so happened that Kyle Boddy was in town too and we all ended up sitting down for about 45 minutes talking about coaching tactics and philosophy. It was a great meeting for me at that point in my coaching career and a pretty rare opportunity for a young coach.”
Thielbar also had a follow up dinner with multiple recruits during that same trip. Both ended up committing soon after.  While his coaching was off to a hot start, Thielbar’s fastball still had life on it, reaching 93 mph throughout his outings with Team USA. The stuff was still there from the previous season, and front offices likely noted the potential of his 2019 peripherals.
Caleb Thielbar is not pitching like an assistant baseball coach — which he is, at Augustana University. Impressive inning for @USABaseball, with one strikeout on a spin-tastic 71-mph curve and another on an overpowering 93-mph fastball. @GoAugie @AugustanaSD
“Half the league started calling,” Thielbar said. “Figured that was a pretty good indication I should give it another go. The Twins just offered the best opportunity and situation for me and my family.”
After having a solid Spring Training at the beginning of 2020, the pandemic hit.
Five years removed from his last pitch at the big league level, and having previously retired, perhaps this would further validate that the game had passed him over. The Twins were coming off a 101-win season, more than double the amount of wins the Tigers had.
Thielbar instead asked what he could do over that time to give him the best chance to contribute and got to work on reinventing his slider.
During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, Thielbar drove an hour twice a week to work on the slider with high-speed cameras at Augustana. Collison, who had taken over pitching coach duties from Thielbar, assisted him.
“It basically just happened one day”, Thielbar said. “Tried a different grip during a bullpen, and it looked as if it had some decent sweep from the eye test. It wasn’t until I threw on a Trackman during summer camp that we confirmed it was what we were looking for.”
When it was time to report back, Thielbar showed off his new slider. The pitch was averaging over 14 inches of sweep, or more than double what he had showcased in 2014. The pitch also maintained a high proportion of its velocity given the movement added. It was just 1.2 miles per hour slower than his 2014 averages, at 77.8 mph.
Last cool thing about pitch design and how the game is changing. Below is the number MLB player pitch types that averaged a sweeper for the entire year (min 25 pitches thrown):2015: 332016: 242017: 29—- Rapsodo is released —-2018: 362019: 412020: 422021: 70 (lmao)
The new slider, combined with the impression he had with the team during Spring Training led to him having his contract selected in early August. He threw a pitch at the big league level for the first time in nearly 2,000 days.
We love a good comeback story. 🥺For the first time since 2015, Minnesota native Caleb Thielbar (@cthielbar56) pitched in an MLB game. The @Twins reliever got emotional in his postgame interview: pic.twitter.com/xMqtG0hFBg
Since 2012, only eight pitchers have gone at least five years between pitches at the Major League level. Thielbar had gone from being unable to get an inning with a team that won 47 games to pitching in the postseason for the Minnesota Twins.
Despite defying odds for the second time in his career, it did not satisfy Thielbar.
Caleb Thielbar booked a trip to Driveline right after the season to plan for the offseason ahead of him. He leveraged the biomechanics lab for further insights on what was impeding the velocity he was looking for. His 89.8 mile per hour average in 2020 ranked in the bottom 10th percentile among lefty relievers. Of course, many could simply cite his age as a natural cause.
Thielbar’s mechanics came back synonymous to the character Mario in Mario Kart. No major weaknesses, but no true outlier traits, according to our database. Of the “Big Ten” metrics we reference in-gym, only one was significantly below average. Hip-Shoulder Separation at foot plant.
Thielbar’s 23.2 degrees of hip-shoulder separation ranked in just the 23rd percentile relative to our database. With this in mind, janitors and drop steps were crowned the drills of choice for Thielbar’s offseason.
While he had some lighter issues, specifically a slightly below average ability to stop his center of gravity at ball release, there was little reason to weight mechanics all that strongly. His deficiencies were simply not egregious, and the opportunity cost of weighting movement above velocity work with external cues and feedback made little sense.
“Velocity was down in 2020 for a variety of reasons, so I didn’t want to be complacent over the offseason,” Caleb Thielbar said. “I took on a very aggressive velocity program to try to not only restore fastball velocity, but the velocity on my breaking balls as well.”
Thielbar initially took some time off following his assessment. Following an on-ramp phase, he went through three phases with Driveline remotely: a velocity phase with Plyo Ball ®, a velocity phase with the leather weighted baseballs, and a competition/live phase in which he was prepping for spring training.
“The results speak for themselves, but I think the biggest takeaway I had was how important mound work is,” Thielbar said. “Threw all my Plyo Ball ® off the mound, Plyo Ball ® velos off the mound. weighted ball velo days off the mound. Then obviously bullpens and lives leading into spring. I felt comfortable on the mound from day 1 of spring, whereas it used to take weeks to get that feeling.”
After being a reliable arm over the 2020 shortened season for the Twins, there were no guarantees for Caleb Thielbar heading into the 2021 season. Thielbar’s decision to continue pursuing velocity and avoid being risk averse turned out to be a wise one. Even after feeling his best and pursuing every route to get better in the offseason, he was the last player selected for the Twins opening day roster in 2021.
Thielbar got off to an extremely hot start in April, ranking 2nd among relievers in K/9 with 19 and 3rd in K-BB% at 45%. His velocity during the first half of the season was 91 — a career high if it would hold into the 2nd half. While he had some tough luck with batted balls (his .354 BABIP was 8th worst among relievers at the break) he was pitching the best in his career at the tasks that are considered as being under the pitchers control, striking out hitters and avoiding walks.
Then came the second half, where Thielbar hit the accelerator on the fastball. He averaged 92 miles per hour in the 2nd half, averaging 92.3 during the last month of the season. He threw multiple fastballs 95.3 miles per hour, half a tick harder than any he had thrown at the big league level previously. His slowest fastball in September was firmer than his average heater in 2020. His velocity in the second half was good for the 40th percentile among lefties, a 30th percentile climb relative to his showing from August to October in 2020.
To further contextualize the velocity gains, the average pitcher 33 or older has lost on average about 1/3 of a mile per hour from one year to the next. Just 28% of those pitchers either keep or gain velocity from the previous season. Thielbar gained 1.5 miles per hour from his age 33 to 34 season. In the Statcast era (2015-2021) this was the 20th biggest gain in velocity for a player over the age of 33 from one season to the next.
Of those 20 players greater than 33 years old that had an increase of at least 1.5 mph from the last season, only Yu Darvish (2020) and Thielbar had career highs in velocity that season (excluding pitchers that went from starters to relievers, such as Jorge de la Rosa and Ian Kennedy).
The descriptive results were there as well. Thielbar was the most valuable reliever for the Twins when looking at bWAR (1.2). He outperformed his Steamer projection (0.2) by an entire win. His fWAR of 0.9 showed his predictive statistics were in alignment with his results on the field. Both suggest his season would’ve been worth ~$10 million dollars on the open market.
His strikeout rate (28.9%) and walk rate (7.5%) were both career bests. His 21.4% K-BB rate was good for 80th percentile among qualified relievers.
“At the end of the day, I know my stuff and command are better than they’ve ever been, and the mindset and confidence are well above where they were in my first stint as well,” Thielbar said. “As surprised as some people are with the results, it isn’t surprising for me because I know the work that has gone into it. I just needed to find the right situation and a front office willing to give me a chance.”
What about that breaking ball velocity? He picked up nearly 2.5 ticks on his slider and added an inch of sweep to it as well. The pitch had an improvement of 32 points in Stuff+, a top 15 improvement across the entire league. The curveball picked up 3 ticks, seeing a 16 point improvement.
The sweeper saw an incredible turnaround from 2020. Thielbar had decided to ditch the pitch entirely for the last month of the season due to command issues. He upped the usage from 20% to 34%. The median miss distance from his intended target went from 14.5” to just 11.6”. The Command+ of the pitch improved 22 points, from an 82 (18% below league average) to a 104 (4% above league average). He was one of just five pitchers who improved their slider Command+ by at least 20 points relative to last year.
At 27 years old, an age generally considered within the range of a pitcher’s prime, Thielbar’s slider was 79 miles per hour with 7 inches of sweep. 7 years later, the pitch averaged 80.2 miles per hour and averaged more than 15 inches of sweep. The Stuff+ of the offering went from a 75 (25% below league average) to 133 (33% above the league average).
“I think his situation is the perfect example of the development process not being linear,” Collison said. “Players at all levels get impatient or complacent when things aren’t going how they hope. This is a great example of sticking to it and working the dips in the roller coaster. You never know when things will start clicking or start working. Proof that if you keep at it and attack your process, anything can happen.”
Caleb Thielbar is an example of a pitcher who has maximized resources and technology throughout the past 5 seasons. Peaking in velocity at age 34, developing a sweeping slider, and even simulating workloads in PULSE throughout the season. The Minnesota native from a town of less than 500 people ensured no stone is unturned in the development process.
“With all the resources available for athletes these days, you really can max out your physical ability and stuff if you’re willing to put in the work,” Thielbar said.
After years of trials and tribulations, from college coach to being one of the league’s best rookies, Thielbar insists there’s still a fine line many athletes may struggle with during their development journey.
“However, while working towards that goal, many forget that the game is still about pitching and getting outs. Consistency, health, nutrition, sleep and the mental game are what will take you to the highest level your ability will allow,” Thielbar said.

I’m looking at Caleb’s last 2 videos, and I am of the opinion (based on observations with a radar gun) that he could use his front side better than what he is exhibiting in those videos. I use a term or cue “swivel up “ (where the glove goes from fingers down in aiding in the rotation to fingers up and in front of glove chest after release) to help stop or drastically reduce the stopping time of upper body rotation. This is what I refer to “stopping the merry go round to throw the kid off”. In short, Caleb may gain 1-2 mph if he can effectively unload the scapular load created by the rotation of the upper body. He is in affect doing flys one arm at a time versus using both and meeting together at the same time at the end of the fly movement. The gain is there.

"Optimizing Breaking Ball Shape Through Data-Driven Pitch Design, Part II",2021-10-12T23:07:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/10/optimizing-breaking-ball-shape-through-data-driven-pitch-design-part-ii/,"By Sam Bornstein, Baseball Ops Analyst
In part one of this breaking ball pitch design series, we introduced a method to calculate expected velocity differentials in breaking balls compared to an athlete’s fastball.
We took a generalized approach to assess an athlete’s breaking ball and fastball characteristics to end up with an expected velocity differential for cutters, sliders, and curveballs. This allows us to say, for example, how much velocity we’d expect a certain athlete’s slider to drop relative to his average fastball speed in that time period.
The use case for this model is fairly straightforward: If an athlete is throwing a pitch slower than what our model expects, we can predict that this athlete may have low feel for a breaking ball and still have room to improve the pitch, overall.
If we recommend that the athlete increase the pitch’s speed to match the expected velocity, we would like to know if that potential improvement comes with additional considerations or tradeoffs worth quantifying.
In this piece, we introduce the velocity-spin efficiency tradeoff and explain how we can utilize that relationship to foresee potential changes in pitch shapes if velocity is increased.
Prior to diving into the tradeoff, let’s first cover the basics of spin efficiency. Spin efficiency is defined as the percentage of spin directly impacting the movement of a pitch. A pitch with 100% efficiency has a spin axis that is perpendicular to home plate, or in other words, has pure transverse spin.
At this efficiency, spin directly influences the movement of the pitch. On the flip side, a pitch with 0% efficiency has a spin axis that is aligned with home plate, otherwise known as gyro spin. Gyro spin does not, for the purposes of this blog, influence a pitch’s movement.
Of course, values between 0% and 100% can be observed, where different combinations of different types of spin impact the pitch.
Spin efficiency is a valuable piece of the puzzle when designing a breaking ball. As we see in the plot above, gloveside pitches have the widest range of spin efficiency values, so finding the optimal range can be quite challenging.
As we noted in the first blog of this series, we are also trying to maximize breaking ball velocity, so we are once again attempting to balance the nuanced tradeoffs between all the components of improving a breaking ball.
Previously, we built a complex model to measure a pitch’s expected velocity differential from its fastball, but assessing the spin efficiency component—in relation to velocity—does not need to be as sophisticated, particularly given that the relationship between the two is often unique from athlete to athlete.
For example, we’ve plotted Corbin Burnes’ spin efficiency-velocity tradeoffs for his breaking ball pitches below.
These three pitches have three unique, linear tradeoffs. For example, as his curveball increases one mile per hour, the spin efficiency is expected to decrease approximately 2.5%. The slider also loses efficiency as velocity increases, but not nearly as much. On the other hand, Burnes’ cutter has a steep linear relationship, increasing 5.5% in spin efficiency for every 1 MPH added.
Intuitively, this makes sense. As the cutter increases in efficiency, it gains more back spin, which is the dominant force in four-seam fastballs. So, the faster the pitch is thrown, the closer it creeps towards resembling the fastball in appearance.
To go beyond just a one player example, we collected data from pitchers over the past two seasons and plotted the density of their per-pitch tradeoff values.
Nearly all pitchers in this sample with a cutter–240 total–see an increase in spin efficiency as velocity rises, which is exactly what we saw for Burnes.
As we move down the breaking ball velocity spectrum, the density of the bell curve moves to the left. Sliders hold a near split, which creates a conflicting result in the spin efficiency-velocity relationship. This could be due to the many shapes and sizes of the pitch, especially in a sample of 734 pitchers, but it further stresses the importance of assessing the tradeoff in each individual pitcher to see what they are capable of.
Lastly, curveballs almost always lose efficiency as velocity climbs. It seems that in order to gain velocity, some component other than transverse spin, such as gyro spin, must be imparted on the baseball.
Understanding the per-pitcher spin efficiency-velocity tradeoffs in the breaking ball arsenal gives you clues to optimizing breaking ball shape. Each pitcher wants to maximize the velocity on his pitches, but when we are optimizing components such as horizontal movement, we must tie these various tradeoffs together to script a detailed plan.
Let’s consider an example. Imagine a pitcher who throws his slider with optimal movement, but at less than expected velocity. We want to know if he is able to keep optimal sweep with an increase in velocity.
To peek behind the curtains, the spin efficiency-velocity tradeoff foreshadows what to expect if you add speed. If the athlete gains or loses spin efficiency with a change in velocity, it tells you that he might lose the optimal shape.
In part one of this series, we identified Logan Gilbert as a pitcher who could benefit from an increase in velocity on both his slider and curveball. These pitches aren’t far apart in shape, as you can see below, but they vary in speed—his slider averaged 83.4 MPH and his curveball 74.8 MPH this season.
With an average four-seam fastball velocity of 95.2 MPH, both pitches show a significant loss of velocity. As we wish to minimize the velocity gap, we can anticipate what may happen to pitch shape by observing the per-pitch tradeoff between velocity and spin efficiency.
Fortunately for Gilbert, historically, he has not lost much efficiency as his two breaking balls have increased speed. Without a significant drop off in efficiency, we would not expect the slider or curveball to lose its current shape if thrown harder.
In a recent Driveline article, we learned that Sergio Romo manipulates the shape of his slider depending on the count situation. As you can see below, this pitch can take the form of a sweeper, backspinner, or even one with a hint of depth.
While we see him wearing a different uniform almost every season, the one thing that’s stayed consistent is the success of Romo’s slider. In 2021, this pitch held a 1.16 xERA and 161 Stuff+. Romo’s slider is a great example of a pitch with an extreme tradeoff between velocity and spin efficiency.
Romo turns to his sweeping slider in counts where he has the advantage over the hitter. This pitch shape has higher spin efficiency, close to 100%, but is thrown in the low to mid 70s. When Romo turns to the back-spinning, shorter slider, it drops significantly in efficiency while getting up to 80 MPH in velocity. Nonetheless, Romo’s versatile slider remains a weapon in his arsenal, no matter the shape or velocity.
As we optimize all the components of a breaking ball, it sometimes becomes a cat-and-mouse game of chasing after various metric thresholds, but that’s the nature of designing or improving a pitch. The information we’ve created unlocks different doors in this process, laying out paths with a guide along the way.
We will never be able to avoid the trial-and-error phase of pitch design, but we can use what we’ve learned to limit the number of trials necessary to succeed.

The Makeup of a Pitcher Debuting in the Major Leagues - Driveline Baseball,2021-09-26T22:40:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/the-makeup-of-a-pitcher-debuting-in-the-major-leagues/,"By Connor Hinchliffe, Pitching Trainer
From 2015 to 2020, nearly 1,000 pitchers have made their Major League debuts.This blog will spotlight the pitchers who have made it to The Show, specifically summarizing makeup (age, height, weight, nationality) and their route to pro ball (college, high school, international) in order to give more recent context to what type of players are debuting, where they are from, and how they got there.
Player age is an important variable in the process of projecting and assessing the true value of a prospect. The importance of age in player development is due to an existing aging curve, which explains that you can expect a player’s performance to decline over time as they age due to a variety of factors.
The Hardball Times aging curve analysis from 2005-2019 shows that once a pitcher reaches their mid-to-late 20’s they will see a significant decline in performance over time, mostly as a result of declining fastball velocity (pretending Jacob DeGrom doesn’t exist). Our updated research from 2010-2021 supports similar theories when investigating velocity and both strikeout and walk percentages.
On average, pitchers saw a bump in velocity on their heater from around age 22 to 26 years of age. At ~27 years old, fastball velocity is expected to decline. It is important to note survivorship bias, which explains that we can only account for the older players that stayed in the big leagues, and can’t account for players who were released or retired in the sample.
Looking at how age affects command, we see that players tend to have their best walk rates between ages 22 and 30. After age 30, walk rates start to climb.
Lastly, due to both declining velocity and command, players 30 and older punch out hitters at a below league average level. Ages 20 to 25 show increasing, above average strikeout percentages. However, punchouts start to decline after age 25, until they reach below average at age 30.
In baseball, age is yet another statistic that gives context to the performance and valuation of a prospect or MLB player.
If a player is succeeding at a level where he is younger than the competition, you can be bullish on the value of his performance. On the other hand, it is less impressive for a prospect to be succeeding when he is significantly older than the competition. In this case, his statistics need to be taken with a grain of salt, or you could give him a promotion to see how he performs against his true peers and age level. There are extenuating circumstances though, such as a player being new to pitching even at a later age.
In the density plot below, we can see the age distribution for all pitchers who made their debut from 2015-2020. The average age of all players is 24.8 years old, the youngest were 19-20 years old, while the oldest to debut were 33-34 years old. All five of the oldest players to debut had playing experience in the Nippon Professional Baseball league in Japan.
Understanding the context behind age and its natural effects on performance can help players (development) and coaches/coordinators (evaluating, development, scouting) for a few reasons:
Getting to the big leagues is hard, while getting there and sticking is even harder. Pitchers are likely getting better at fending off aging effects with advanced training methods, but continuous declining performance still exists and can derail careers if not accounted for.
Driveline has the tools to not only help you maximize your potential, but also help you sustain that potential for as long as possible.
The “eye test” exists for a reason, and that’s because athletes at the highest level of their sport are usually physically imposing figures. The average pitcher in this sample was 6 feet 2.5 inches tall and weighed 213 pounds, while 70% of the pitchers weighed over 200 pounds. If you are an athlete struggling to put big numbers on the radar gun and weigh 170 pounds, increasing strength and body weight is a good place to start.
Looking the part matters.
For players trying to reach the big leagues, there are so many factors out of your control. However, it is widely understood that body weight, strength, and power are controllable factors that play a significant role in a pitcher’s ability to throw hard.
For a long time, it was frowned upon for a pitcher to lift heavy in the gym because it was thought to affect mobility and increase injuries, or a variety of other debunked things. Now, pitchers are spending more time in the weightroom in both the off-season and in-season, lifting heavier, and as a result, getting heavier. Between 1990 and 2010, the average weight of an MLB player increased by 20.9 pounds from 188lbs to 209lbs.
Major League Baseball is a diverse sport of players from many countries, and their impact on the culture of the game can be seen now more than ever. On active opening day rosters this season, there were 256 international players, representing 20 different countries. The US (72%), Dominican Republic (10%), and Venezuela (7%) were the top three countries supplying big league talent on opening day in 2021.
These trends were almost identical for pitchers debuting from 2015-2020. The United States represented 76% of players, Dominican Republic showed 11%, and Venezuela was in third with 7%. The rest of the world combined to make up the final 6%.
Digging deeper, we can break down the American players, both college and high school signees, by state. Unsurprisingly, California, Texas, and Florida were the top three states producing the most players, as they’re bigger in size and are commonly regarded as ametaur baseball hotbeds. Wyoming, Vermont, and Maine were without a single player during this five year span.The southeast and northeast regions had the highest populations of players when accounting for player-per-square mile.
*From publicly available data*
By which route did these players get to professional baseball? We broke down whether they entered professional baseball by way of the draft/free agent signs (college or high school), or international signings.
The majority broke into pro-ball via college, making up over half of the players at 59%. Louisville, Florida, Cal-State Fullerton, Kentucky, and Vanderbilt had the most debuts during this five year span. International signs accounted for nearly a quarter of the pitchers at 24%. Lastly, 17% of the players came straight from high school, with California, Florida, and Texas supplying the most of those prospects.
There are plenty of paths for amateur players to reach professional baseball and chase their dreams of making it to the big leagues. This piece aimed to give a more recent update on the people toeing the rubber in the show for the first time—who they are, and how they got there.

Rethinking the True Run Value of a Pitch With a Pitch Model - Driveline Baseball,2021-09-23T22:27:14+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/rethinking-the-true-run-value-of-a-pitch-with-a-pitch-model/,"By John Asel, Baseball Ops Intern
Our intrinsic pitch values combine stuff and pitch location to predict the expected change in run value a given pitch should create based on its raw flight characteristics. It is pretty darn good, but it is not perfect. Certain pitchers—through deception, sequencing, tunneling, etc—have demonstrated the ability to consistently exceed our expectations from year to year.
We know players like this will exist, but how much data do we need until we can confidently say that someone is an outlier relative to their peers?
That question is the basis of this investigation.
The metric we will be using across these analyses is the change in run value (RE12 with an xwOBA base) minus the intrinsic pitch value (from our pitch model); in other words, the difference between the observed and expected run value changes on a pitch-by-pitch basis.
We’ll refer to this metric as “intrinsic residual” where negative is the pitcher performing better than expected.
To test the reliability of “intrinsic residual”, we will be using Cronbach’s alpha. For those unfamiliar with Cronbach’s alpha, FanGraphs wrote a great introduction in 2015 which we highly encourage you to read if you have not already.
The gist is that Cronbach’s alpha measures the internal consistency of a sample, giving us an estimate of what proportion of the variance observed is reproducible (likely due to ‘true talent’) as opposed to randomness. The typical alpha threshold considered reliable is 0.7—where ~50% of the variance is attributable to a rough proxy for ‘true talent’.
With the gory math aside and our framework built out, we can first look at a player’s general intrinsic residual to give us a sense of the X factor they possess relative to our model.
A negative value indicates that a pitcher performed better than expected while a positive value indicates that a pitcher performed worse than expected. Taking the sum of these residuals on the pitch-by-pitch level can give us an idea which pitchers have cumulatively deviated from our model’s expectations the most during the Statcast era (2015-present).
Keep in mind that the units of these residuals are runs. So, Kyle Hendricks has prevented 219 more runs over the Statcast era than our model predicted—even though the model does account for his otherworldly command.
To put that in perspective, according to baseballreference.com, Hendricks has prevented 126 runs relative to a league average pitcher. Without his X factor, our model thinks he would have been as below average as he has been above average.
Had Hendricks not possessed such an ability to exceed expectations, he would not be the pitcher he is today and he would not get the playing time he gets today. In other words, players with poor X factors are fighting an uphill battle because they must be several runs better to survive.
This is the essence of survivorship bias and it explains why the pitchers who are beating our model by the most are doing so at a higher magnitude than those who are relatively underperforming. For example, if a hypothetical pitcher had a X factor that hurt them as much as Scherzer’s X factor helps him, they would have to possess elite stuff just to be league average.
Then again, the analysis above is just taking the sum of residuals, which is highly dependent on playing time accrued. To avoid playing-time bias, we need to build a rate statistic and use some sample size threshold to find the true leaders and laggards.
That brings us back to the question we set out to answer: At what point can we be confident that the intrinsic residual we are observing is not just randomness?
To answer this question, we need to look at the graphic above showing Cronbach’s alpha values at various sample sizes on the season (blue) and career (red) levels. It is a lot to look at if you have not seen one of these graphs before, so let’s do an example interpretation.
When X = 1000, the required sample size to be included is 1000 pitches thrown. Looking at the graph’s dotted lines, we see that ~50% of pitchers and ~30% of pitcher-seasons in the Statcast era have thrown 1000+ pitches. When those with less than 1000 pitches are filtered out of our sample, the alpha value is ~0.5 for both the season and career levels. Thus, we can infer that when looking at a player’s entire career or at a specific season, it takes approximately 1000 pitches for 25% of their average intrinsic residual to be explained by ‘true talent’ as opposed to randomness.
Example aside, we’re more concerned with the 0.7 threshold—the level where 50% of the variance is explained by ‘true talent’—and where it is crossed, as that is where most traditional baseball analysts consider a metric ‘reliable’. As shown above, this threshold is crossed just above 3000 pitches on both the season and career levels.
Below are the mean intrinsic residual leaders and laggards with a minimum of 3000 career pitches thrown in the Statcast era.
As in the previous table, we see that the pitcher-friendly residuals are of a larger absolute magnitude than the hitter-friendly residuals. Brad Ziegler, with his unorthodox release point, outperforms expectations by one run every 33 pitches!
Looking at general X factors like this is cool, but how does it break down on the pitch type level? Do all pitchers’ pitches exceed expectations uniformly or do certain pitch types deliver the bulk of the benefits? Let’s run the same procedure but treat each pitcher’s pitch types distinctly.
Grouping by pitch type cuts down on our sample size but is quite insightful. While players generally take 3040 pitches to reach career mean intrinsic residual reliability across all pitches, the average player-pitch type only takes 1400 pitches to do so. This suggests that, for any given pitcher, certain pitch types will systematically deviate from our model’s predictions to different degrees and—in some instances—in opposite directions.
An astute reader may be wondering, why do the season and career trends diverge around 400 pitches? Sample size is our friend here. What pitch types persist as the minimum sample size threshold is raised? Fastballs. If fastballs take longer to reliably defy our models, it makes sense for the slope of the Cronbach alpha chart to decrease as fastballs become a disproportionate part of the remaining pitch population.
To test this hypothesis, I looked at how long it takes each of the major pitch types to reach the alpha threshold of .7 at the career level.
Figure Three: Red = Four-seamers, Orange = Sinkers, Green = Changeups, Blue = Curveballs, Purple = Sliders, Brown = Cutters, Black = All Pitch Types. The dotted lines pertain to the remaining proportion of that pitch type’s population that survives the corresponding sample size threshold.
As hypothesized, fastballs take longer to become reliable and come to dominate the population of remaining pitch types as the sample size threshold is raised. That explains the season-career gap in Figure Two, but let’s see what this graph has to say about the speed at which various pitch types become reliable.
The intrinsic residuals of breaking balls reach the threshold far quicker than the other pitch types. This suggests a contextual nature to breaking balls. Whether due to arsenal interplay or a particular dependence on deception, the outcomes of sliders and curveballs relatively quickly diverge from what their raw flight characteristics would suggest.
With these pitch-type-specific thresholds, we can see which pitches have reliably defied our model at both extremes.
In looking at the table above, we observe a lot of sinkers at the top, no? Indeed and there is quite a good reason for it: Seam-shifted wake (SSW).
We have written about this before, so to avoid rehashing too heavily, here’s the gist: When the seams on a pitch are oriented in a certain way, the ball will gain a particularly deceptive type of movement. This effect is most commonly observed in sinkers and those atop this list are known creators of this funky movement.
Our model, developed before SSW was discovered, looks at just the flight characteristics of a given pitch and cannot tell whether movement was produced normally or via SSW. With SSW being a key to a sinker’s success, it makes sense that many of the largest residuals come from those who generate the effect.
On the other end of the spectrum, we see all sliders and curveballs. It is interesting to note how elite these pitches are—maybe it is a clue to why breaking balls reach intrinsic residual reliability so quickly. Perhaps hitters know the quality of the pitch and must sit on it to some extent so they don’t end up on PitchingNinja.
That might be part of the reason Sonny Gray has two pitches on opposite ends of the spectrum; hitters are terrified of being embarrassed by his curveball and give up some extra ground to his sinker.
After a certain number of pitches, we can be confident that a given pitcher’s pitch will continue defying our model’s expectations. But to what extent? At any given sample size, how much credit do we give the player? Thankfully, those Cronbach alpha values can help us out again. As detailed in a different FanGraphs article, the higher the alpha value, the less you regress to the mean.
So, in truth, there is no single point where you can suddenly start trusting the residuals. Instead, new data should be used in concert with what was already known to constantly refine our expectations going forward.
In the table above, we see some of the dirtiest breaking balls in the game at the top, with some position players at the bottom. Looking good.
That said, it is worth taking a moment to discuss how certain pitcher-pitch types end up at the top of this list. There are essentially three avenues that exist on a spectrum:
The first avenue is well exemplified by the sliders of both Dellin Betances and Max Scherzer. Our model recognizes them as nasty pitches, but based on extraordinary results in sufficient sample sizes, our refined expectations rightfully elevate them to some of the best pitches in baseball.
Although Sam Clay’s slider falls just outside the top five pitches, it is a golden example of the third avenue: Underperforming yet ultimately rate highly. The key to such a feat? Pitch count.
At the time of writing, Sam Clay has thrown 149 sliders in the major leagues. That pitch count corresponds with a high intrinsic pitch value reliability (alpha = 0.88), but a low intrinsic residual reliability (alpha = 0.20). In simpler terms, we have a strong belief that Clay’s SL is nasty, even by lofty big-league standards, and we cannot be sure that it will continue to underperform our expectations moving forward due to a small sample size.
Pitches can still rate highly if the results on the field provide insufficient evidence to overrule the model’s original output.
When evaluating an athlete, we need to understand which pitches are assets and which are ripe for improvement. Stuff+ from The Blob tells most of the story, but command and results need to be considered as well.
Imagine a pitcher with a changeup that grades below average in raw stuff, but who also has impeccable command with the pitch. If they could adopt a better shape with the same feel, that would be great, but there is likely lower hanging fruit in the arsenal. Further, if the changeup has consistently produced better results than expected, we can be confident that it is not in need of fixing.
Getting better starts when building a plan of attack; finding weaknesses and ways to improve them. With this infrastructure to weigh in-game success against raw flight characteristics, we can decode mixed signals and better aid the outliers on their path to greener pastures.

Optimizing Breaking Ball Shape Through Data-Driven Pitch Design,2021-09-17T00:30:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/optimizing-breaking-ball-shape-through-data-driven-pitch-design-part-one/,"Written by Sam Bornstein
With technologies like Rapsodo, TrackMan, and Yakkertech reaching the mainstream in recent years, designing a specific breaking ball for an athlete has never been more straightforward to accomplish.
Big leaguers are using advances in Pitch Design to their advantage to increase velocity and add additional sweep and depth to their breaking balls, helping them achieve a record number of strikeouts in the process.
Of course, we know that we’ve always been striving for more sweep, more depth, and more velocity with breaking balls, and, as a function of that, the league’s average slider has only gotten nastier over time. But, let’s consider a more likely scenario: what if adding sweep to a breaking ball comes with a loss of velocity, or adding velocity comes with a loss of depth and spin efficiency?
How do we optimize the three components of improving a breaking ball while being cognizant of the nuanced tradeoff between them all?
In this blog, we’ll try to tackle some of those hard hitting questions by providing context using MLB data and Driveline’s internal models—models we use with our own high-level athletes in Pitch Design sessions. This will be part one of a two-part breaking ball pitch design blog series.
The hope here is that the reader can put these insights into play within their own Pitch Design sessions to design more effective breaking balls with their athletes.
An athlete can fashion a breaking pitch in many shapes to achieve the desired movement and spin pattern. Sticking to traditional classifications, the spectrum of glove-side pitches includes cutters, sliders, and curveballs.
A cutter, also known as a “cut-fastball”, is thrown with higher velocity, less horizontal break and more vertical carry than a slider or curveball. It gets its name from the sharp, “cutting” action it moves with. The pitch mostly moves with backspin and gyrospin, which is how the velocity is generated. Sometimes, sidespin is mixed in, and depending on how much, the pitch becomes a hybrid between a slider and a fastball. For some pitchers, a cutter is their primary offering because of how hard they can throw it.
A slider is a cutter’s close neighbor. Traditionally thrown with more sidespin than backspin, the pitch traditionally breaks glove-side with more lateral sweep than cutters (gyro-dominant sliders excluded). Because it balances the three spin components, sliders come in many different shapes and sizes, and the amount of sweep is often the focal point of the shape.
Curveballs are thrown with the most downward movement of the three breaking balls. This depth is achieved by adding topspin to the release of the pitch. There is less diversity in curveball shapes; the most common types have straight downward movement—a 12-6 curveball—or “slurvy” action, where it is thrown with equal parts negative horizontal break and vertical break.
Above are the 2021 MLB averages for velocity, vertical break, (normalized) horizontal break, and spin efficiency for fastballs, cutters, sliders, and curveballs. As we move across the breaking ball velocity spectrum, there’s an increase in horizontal sweep, which we can refer to as the velocity-sweep tradeoff, along with an increase in depth.
Given that a trade-off between velocity and movement exists on breaking balls, one of the first things we like to do at Driveline is put a player’s breaking ball into context relative to league-wide expectation.
For example, depicted in the visualization above is Corbin Burnes’ no-hit outing from September 11th, where we can see that all three of his breaking pitches — the CT, SL, and CB — all fell within the relative sweep-velocity tradeoff regions we’d expect a big leaguer to land in.
While relatively unsurprising given how successful all three pitches play on a per-outing basis, the visualization above becomes more important—even critical—when evaluating the breaking balls of amateur and lower level players, given that it helps us scale a player’s feel for throwing a breaking ball relative to their FB velocity.
So, rather than using a pitch model to harshly grade a 77 mph gyro-SL because it’s 77 mph, the visualization above can help scale this hypothetical pitch for an athlete that throws 84 mph and put the pitch in better context.
By showing an athlete that their SL actually falls in-line with big league expectations, and just doesn’t have sharpness because they throw 84 mph with their FB, you can give the athlete some peace of mind. They know that their SL is fine as is, and that FB velocity is the main thing keeping them from throwing a quality breaker.
A trainer or coach can program a bit more optimally knowing that multiple pitch design sessions with the breaking ball aren’t a must if the FB velo ticks up.
To more precisely evaluate a player’s breaking ball, we built a model to estimate each pitch’s expected velocity differential from the pitcher’s fastball, based on the spin-components of the breaking ball, characteristics of the fastball, and arm angle of the pitcher.
To visualize how each of Burnes’ breaking balls differ in velocity from his fastball, we plotted them with their spin direction on a polar coordinate graph. The actual velocity differentials are plotted on the left below and the expected differentials from our model are plotted on the right.
In 2021, Burnes has averaged a drop of 1.6 mph on his cutter, but our model expects him to drop 4.0 mph. Thus, Burnes gains 2.4 mph more than expected on the pitch. On the other hand, his curveball loses 3.9 mph more than the expected 11.7 mph differential, dropping 15.6 mph on average. Lastly, his slider velocity differential is nearly identical to his expected loss at 8.9 mph.
To no surprise, the cutter is Burnes’ most used pitch, and, in terms of intrinsic run values since 2020, his best pitch, followed by the slider and curveball. Per our Stuff+ model, these pitches have scores of 172, 155, and 91, respectively.
If the stellar right-hander has an area to improve, there is potentially some room to add a few miles per hour back onto the curveball to become even more effective, assuming that the pitch doesn’t then blend in with his SL. But, as we stated previously, velocity often cannot be increased without some tradeoff.
To illustrate how players can work around their own Velo-Movement trade-off, let’s consider a pitcher who increased his slider velocity between seasons.
Houston Astros right-handed pitcher Cristian Javier enjoyed a nice rookie season in 2020 and has continued that success into this year. Javier increased his slider velocity 2.8 mph from 2020 to 2021, one of the largest increases across the league.
Javier’s slider in 2020 was a more traditional lateral sweeper with 13.2 inches of glove-side movement and 2.3 inches of vertical break at 78.6 mph. The 2021 version of this pitch shortened up a bit, losing 3 inches of sweep and gaining 2.3 inches of carry in the process, as well as the 2.8 mph velocity gain.
While the velocity gain and subsequent loss in movement from season to season illustrates the tough give and take in breaking ball pitch design, this tradeoff observed is exactly what we’d expect given the change in spin profile, according to our expected velo-drop model.
In other words, given that we know how much velocity Javier would gain or lose by shortening or lengthening the shape of his breaking ball via a model, we can create more realistic pitch design goals with athletes and chase an optimal shape that is individualized for each player.
It seems as though the Astros have similar insights, given that both versions of Javier’s sliders have performed pretty well against big league hitters. Not all tradeoffs have negative consequences; it’s about optimizing where the breaking ball is most effective and understanding how each athlete adapts to these adjustments.
While we’ve demonstrated use-cases for when an expected movement/velo tradeoff model can be used for athletes with high feel for spin, the model can also identify pitchers with breaking ball velocity differentials that are below league expectation.
The Miami Marlins’ All-Star pitcher possesses a slider that loses more velocity from his fastball than we expect. Here is his arsenal at this point in the season.
While the left-hander possesses a pretty lights-out CH, his breaking ball has a high degree of gyro spin, which doesn’t give it much carry or sweep. Thrown at 81.8 mph, it drops 12.6 mph from his 94.9 mph heater, 4.9 mph more than the 7.7 mph drop we’d expect given the spin profile. This same pitch at 87 mph could be dramatically more effective, and we would only guess that it would be used more often than 15% of the time.
Previously, we plotted Burnes’ breaking ball velocity differentials on a polar coordinate graph with each pitch’s spin direction. We saw that each pitch’s actual velocity drop lined up fairly well with its expected difference. With Rogers, the opposite is true.
Due to its gyro spin, his slider lives all around the 360-degree axis. Those pitches that back up on him have smaller expected differentials because they do not break gloveside much, and spin in the same direction as his fastball.
Despite the phenomenal season he’s putting together in 2021, he relies on his four-seam fastball and changeup 85% of the time. Mixing in a harder gyro-slider or a brand new sweeping slider with the expected velocity differential could make Rogers all the more successful against big league hitters.
Bassitt throws two times the number of pitches that Rogers does, carrying an arsenal of six pitches that have a wide spectrum of velocities. The Oakland A’s right-hander pairs his hard, sharp cutter with two significantly slower breaking balls.
The all-star pitcher’s slider and curveball are 15.9 mph and 21.2 mph slower, respectively, than his average fastball velocity. For pitchers with both FF and SI, our model uses the average velocity of these two combined to find the differential values. Bassitt’s SL and CB are approximately league average in terms of our Stuff+ model this season, and we noticed an interesting adjustment he made with his slider within the last couple months.
Since mid-June, the slow sweeper is steadily becoming a harder, shortened version of the pitch. Pitches with less sweep are typically thrown a bit faster, as per the velocity-sweep tradeoff, so Bassitt is likely in the midst of making said tradeoff, whether intentional or not.
As the slider becomes closer in velocity to the cutter, the curveball lags behind in speed and becomes a freeze pitch by nature. The usage rate and location of the pitch becomes even more important to maintain its success at such a low velocity.
With three breaking balls and six total pitches in the fold, it’s difficult to formulate the proper usage of each pitch. The slider and curveball are two of his lesser-used pitches, so the less than average velocity expectation could be a product of the lack of reps given to them.
For some pitchers, it can be less straightforward to make pitch adjustments in the middle of the season, but for Bassitt, whether intentional or not, this adjustment seems to be working.
Scaling back to a more traditional FF, SL, CB, CH arsenal, Seattle Mariners’ highly-touted prospect, Logan Gilbert, has had a respectable rookie season thanks in large part to his exceptional four-seam fastball.
Gilbert’s slider has roughly league average stuff, but is his worst pitch in terms of intrinsic run values, followed closely by the curveball, which grades out poorly in terms of stuff. Despite the slider having a few inches of vertical lift on it, its velocity differential puts it in the same group as curveball velocity drops. The graph below is the same velocity-sweep tradeoff we generated for Burnes, but for Gilbert we connected the average velocity differentials for both actual and expected shapes.
In this visual, square represents the average velocity differential of the pitch, and the circle represents the average expected velocity differential. The other component is the average horizontal movement, so we must consider that the expected velocity differential (circle) is not precisely the amount of sweep we would expect the pitcher to possess.
Each of Gilbert’s breaking balls could use quite a boost in velocity; however, similar to the theme of this blog, any gain in velocity is likely to be met with changes in the amount of gloveside break. Thus, with such a large potential gain to be had, it’s possible that the shape of each pitch could change dramatically.
We should consider that certain pitchers can only tweak so much within their arsenal. The models we build come with that in mind, so it’s imperative to consider the athlete’s personal talent levels and historical tradeoffs before making an adjustment to a pitch.
Other tradeoffs may show up and make further decisions or reevaluations necessary.
One component we did not discuss in this blog was the tradeoff between breaking ball velocity and spin efficiency. This is something that will be covered in the second post of this series.
Pitch design is not a linear process. The beauty in designing a pitch is the trial-and-error process of exploring different possible shapes and characteristics. As outlined in Driveline’s Basics of Pitch Design certification course, trial-and-error occurs at every phase of the pitch design process, with many of these phases overlapping.
While we can determine objective measures that make pitches more effective, there is a level of individuality still involved in deciding the unique adjustments. That’s why having a model to estimate the expected velocity differentials eliminates some guesswork in determining the proper shape for a given pitcher.
In the end, a roadmap with some stones uncovered is far more appealing than one with more mysteries.

Quantitative vs. Qualitative Mechanical Analysis in Pitching Biomechanics -,2021-08-28T00:51:06+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/quantitative-vs-qualitative-mechanical-analysis-in-pitching-biomechanics/,"Written by Chris Langin
“Johnny! If you used those legs, you’d throw a good 5-7 miles per hour harder!”
If you’re reading this blog, you’re likely familiar with the mechanical jargon used throughout the world of baseball.
From youth fields across the globe to the 9-figure stadiums that play host to the world’s most talented hurlers, there’s undoubtedly a coach, parent, or spectator discussing their displeasure with a pitcher’s mechanics at this very second.
At some point during your baseball career, you’ve likely found yourself in Johnny’s shoes. You’ve also recently noticed that the umpire has yet to throw somebody out of a game for throwing the baseball too fast.
This realization seems pretty insightful, but given certainty isn’t your strength, you discuss the topic with your family during dinner. Your intuition turns out to be correct; the pitcher is, in fact, not restricted to any sort of speed limit.
A few months go by and you’re not quite certain how fast you’re throwing the baseball, but you know you want to throw it faster.
Then, one day during your bullpen session, you receive some critical feedback regarding your pitching technique: “If you used those legs, you’d throw a good 5-7 miles per hour harder!”
At first, you’re frustrated that you’ve done something incorrect. Usually, this type of thing only happens when you forget to do your homework. However, you grin inside when it sinks in that using your legs better could improve your velocity.
This is some of the best news you’ve heard. Heck, you couldn’t even stand on two feet and walk at one point in your life. Getting into those legs a bit more during your pitching motion seems elementary.
Three days later, your next bullpen opportunity arrives. “Just use your legs,” you tell yourself. Your confidence is extremely high while you’re playing catch. You lift your lead leg up and down for several reps, acknowledging that you indeed will use this leg today.
You alert your catcher that the ball is going to be coming in firmer today. He smells like chlorine and doesn’t seem to care much. After mimicking a few more leg lifts for good measure, you finally toe the rubber. You close your eyes and take a deep breath. Finally, you convince yourself you’re ready for this life-changing moment.
You wind-up and leverage your legs for the first time during an overhead toss in your life. The ball arrives at the plate and the dirt in front of the mound remains undamaged. Your catcher lifelessly tosses the ball back to you.
“How was that?” you ask.
“Little slower than last week,” he responds.
After three more tosses that end in a similar result, you scream this question at the top of your lungs:
“How the hell do I use my legs?”
Helping Johnny out is the motivation of our quantitative/qualitative study.
All performance coaches have good intentions:
Leverage the resources at your disposal to identify your athletes’ limiting factors.
Relay that information in a digestible manner, with the goal of improving that athlete’s performance.
With our motion capture lab, we’re able to precisely quantify how our athletes are moving to identify their movement limitations and track changes. However, most athletes and trainers don’t have access to a lab, so have to make due with what they do have. While the lab is the optimal solution for assessing mechanics, we’d be remiss if we claimed players and coaches are helpless without it.
While a trainer’s misplaced overconfidence in their understanding of how an athlete’s mechanics work could get in the way of the athlete, the other extreme of providing no feedback limits how much you can help an athlete.
Many of our pitching trainers at Driveline came from low-level college ranks. If a fresh set of baseballs wasn’t in the cards, there certainly wouldn’t be any motion capture labs in the budget.
While you can track if your athletes improve, there are a variety of competing variables that could be responsible such as strength, bodyweight, sleep, and simple throwing fitness improvements. Thus, it can be tough to know what is a result of your mechanical feedback (qualitative in the absence of a lab) or not, to use that as a proxy for how good you are at assessing mechanics.
This hindsight inspired us to partake in a qualitative/quantitative pitching kinematics study. Trainers could uncover their “true talent” level in evaluating kinematic positions in slow-motion. This also allows us to start peeling away at Johnny’s question: “How do I use my legs?”.
Johnny’s original question was a bit too broad, though he’s on the right track to question what exactly that meant. We intended to quantify some of the following mechanical jargon commonly passed around in the gym:
We wanted to identify whether there was validity to these qualitative categories. If so, what biomechanics actually define these classifications? The open/closed pelvis question is more easily defined. This question identified our trainers “true talent” in analyzing biomechanics qualitatively.
For reference, pitching assessments at Driveline last five days. On day one, athletes throw in the motion capture lab. Athletes have their biomechanics meeting on day three. The R&D department processes that report over that time period, giving us about a 48-hour window to provide a qualitative assessment, without it potentially being biased by having seen the actual report.
For an athlete to qualify for our study, trainers/athletes must meet the following criteria:
All in-gym trainers at Driveline took part in the study. To account for trainer bandwidth concerns, we assigned three trainers to each athlete. We took the weight of those three trainer samples over the weight of each individual trainer to get a better feel for department opinion. While we may incorporate this in a future analysis, there was a fear of significant noise given we didn’t have a 100+ athlete sample.
We used iPhone side-view video with a standardized set up. If parallax error was present, we omitted the athlete from the sample. We also saw some user errors occur when taking videos. We omitted athletes that had their videos return to regular speed prior to ball release.
This study started right at the start of collegiate summer. Our department analyzed the first athlete on May 3rd, and the last athlete on June 20th, creating a sample of 56 athletes. If two or more trainers chose the same positive response for a category, that athlete was binned accordingly.
Example: Two trainers responded with Athlete A being rotational, one responded “undecided”. That athlete would be a rotational thrower.
However, if the response was even across the board (one rotational, one linear, one undecided) we omitted the athlete from our analysis.
Let’s first begin by looking at our “qualitative categories”.
Rotational vs. Linear Thrower
Most compelling differences:
Whippy vs. Pushy Arm Action
Whippy pitchers…
Glute vs. Quad dominant
And finally, our lone qualitative kinematic question to judge our trainers “true talent” in assessing positions with slow-motion side view:
Open vs. Closed Pelvis at Foot Plant
Open pitchers had…
Slow motion video is a resource that should continue to be leveraged by coaches, trainers, and athletes. The pitching department could discern significant differentiators in pelvis angle at foot plant.
These findings could apply to daily throwing evaluation between a trainer and athlete. This study however doesn’t suggest trainers have the talent level to quantify kinematic positions at foot plant with even 90% certainty.
However, binning athletes in ~15 degree buckets (Open/Closed) could have some credence. Adding in multiple opinions from other trainers/coaches likely ups the certainty level in the accuracy of these buckets as well.
Any type of remote training especially gains value from these insights. While our in-gym population still benefits from feedback between retests, they’re still provided a retest report every 6 weeks that is void of subjective evaluation. Online trainers may have an athlete for 4+ months without a retest motion capture during that time period. The ability to bucket these athletes via collaboration between their co-workers and managers likely adds further accuracy to their evaluation.
In addition, our lab could detect (based on our trainers’ judgement) the validity of several qualitative categories.
The methods for this study were not very rigorous. Largely, this study’s intention was to detect signal for future work on the topic. With limited previous work, an extremely rigorous protocol didn’t seem efficient given the scarcity of trainer hours during the summer.
Selection bias is also unavoidable in this study. Evaluators in this study were all trainers from Driveline. Trainers evaluate several hundred motion capture reports a year. Identifying how accurately an average coach, or another portion of the population, could make kinematic evaluations would be a significant insight.
Further evaluation of qualitative categories is on the agenda. Quantifying these categories with kinematic variables provides us with more closure on what they’re detailing.
“Good/Bad Downward Move?”
“Vertical vs. Non-Vertical Shin Angle?”
“Heel Connection vs. Early Extension?”
The same exists with qualitative kinematic evaluations. It’s likely that certain kinematic variables (torso rotational velo,  are easier to evaluate without a motion capture session than others.
A study showcasing the error range to expect from the “coaching eye” provides coaches with some clarity during their evaluations. Certain metrics may warrant confident feedback when using side view as a resource. For others, perhaps voiding any opinion is best.
“Elbow Flexion Inside 90 degrees vs. Outside 90 degrees.”
“Shoulder Horizontal Abduction: Good/Average/Bad?”
Finally, we’d love to introduce a larger population into our evaluation pool. Detailing what the average coach’s evaluation looks like is the ultimate insight we’re looking for.
Most coaches/trainers aren’t going to have the luxury of constant access to a biomechanics lab. Furthermore, their livelihood isn’t dependent on delivering these mocap findings to athletes 365 days a year. The practical implications of these studies for a broader public depends on getting a study that includes evaluations from a variety of coaches.
And Johnny, to answer your question… just throw in a biomechanics lab.

How the Cincinnati Reds Used PULSE to More Effectively Manage Their Pitching Staff - Driveline Baseball,2021-08-26T01:10:39+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/how-the-cincinnati-reds-used-pulse-to-more-effectively-manage-their-pitching-staff/,"Written by Joe Marsh
This blog is the third post in our series of blogs highlighting successful implementations of PULSE. You can check out the first blog here.
This one will focus on how Kyle Boddy (yes, the founder of Driveline) implemented PULSE with the Reds this past year.
Becoming the Director of Pitching for the Reds meant that Boddy was responsible for every pitcher, and every pitching coach in the Reds minor league system.
In particular, Boddy knew he could refine how pitchers were managed and used during the season. Typical innings and pitch counts don’t actually capture if a pitcher is really ready to throw – and Boddy knew that PULSE could be the solution.
He began implementing PULSE throughout the organization with the help of the man in our last blog — Bryan Conger, Boddy’s pitching coordinator.
The first way Boddy and the Reds were able to leverage PULSE was by managing fatigue in their pitchers’ pregame routines.
Boddy noticed that his starting pitchers were typically gassed by the time they were ready to throw on the mound in a game. They would rip through warmups, Plyo Ball ®, long toss, and their pre-game bullpen one after the other and then go straight into the game. This would lead to more fatigue, more missed pitches, more walks, and more runs surrendered in the first innings of games.
Using PULSE, Bryan Conger noticed that their fatigue units — a live measure of a pitcher’s fatigue — during their pregame routine would be through the roof, and certainly well above the recommended threshold.
Fatigue units are modelled to evaluate the effects of forces, cycle times, and postures on muscle fatigue during repetitive tasks, like throwing. They create a better representation of the fatigue that a pitcher accrues compared to inning or pitch counts. A full blog detailing fatigue units can be found here.
At Conger’s suggestion, Boddy decided to implement Conger’s idea: Regulate the pregame routines of their pitchers by mandating 3 minute breaks between each phase of their throwing program: Plyo Ball ®/weighted ball work, longtoss, pregame bullpen, and finally, the game.
They noticed their pitchers were actually looking fresh when going into the game and, more importantly, walks and runs went down in their first inning.
There’s also a natural pairing between fatigue units and heart rate that is currently being investigated. By pairing heart rate data and other recovery-based metrics with PULSE and fatigue units, Boddy and the Reds hope to have the full picture of how ready their pitchers are to throw, and how they recover.
Managing starter workload in-season is an integral part of ensuring pitchers can perform at their full potential — this exact issue was detailed in the first blog in this series.
But professional baseball has an added twist, in that starters don’t throw once per week. They might throw on 7 days of rest, and sometimes they’ll throw on 4 days of rest. Managing short term fatigue with the added variability in scheduling is essential.
To do this, Boddy followed the outline pioneered by Conger — between-start throwing volume is adjusted based on how much the starter threw and when he’s scheduled to throw next. By using PULSE, they’re able to know exactly how much a pitcher needs to throw to make sure he’s fresh for his next start, while maintaining his throwing fitness.
In one example, a pitcher we’ll call Athlete 3 drew the Tuesday and Sunday starts — 4 days of rest in between starts.
He was prescribed low throwing volume recovery days during the week, along with an abbreviated lower intensity side-session to get some mound work in. These measures were successful in helping him recover, but still get some work done in between starts.
On gameday, by knowing Athlete 3’s pregame routine, they are able to simulate his workload data for the day and project what his chronic workload and A:C Ratios will be after he throws in a game — and how many pitches will keep him in a healthy range.
It’s important to note that A:C Ratio isn’t a strict guideline. It’s merely a good rule of thumb.
The plan was for Athlete C to go 60 pitches on Sunday. On gameday, he wound up throwing a bit less in his pregame than projected which left him room to extend his pitch count in the game a bit. But after the 4th inning and at 57 pitches, his velocity was starting to drop. So the coaches opted to pull him early.
Because a pitcher could safely throw more pitches according to PULSE, it doesn’t mean he should. There is more context to making decisions than just A:C Ratio.
Managing relievers is a beast in itself — you never know when you need a guy to throw, if he’s fresh, or if he needs an offday. PULSE helps navigate these waters. Boddy and his crew leverage PULSE to create player cards that guide pitcher usage in games.
By dividing the relievers into their own subteam, Boddy and his coaches can glance at the Dashboard on PULSE Dash and immediately see what pitchers are fresh, who needs rest, and who can be stretched out to 2-3 innings. Take a look at the screenshot below
It’s immediately obvious that the athlete highlighted in gray — who just threw — could be ready to go on one day of rest, with an expected A:C Ratio of 1.06 after an off day.
Another athlete – the one with their A:C Ratio flagged in yellow – was coming off of the IL and had just thrown live. He was expected to be activated and ready to throw tomorrow, but given that his A:C Ratio is at 1.31, the Reds opted to activate him a day later to minimize any unnecessary risk.
Using the information above, as well as the Gameday report available in PULSE Dash, Boddy’s coaches are able to create game cards that guide pitcher usage for the day. They look something like this:
Starters have their expected innings and pitch counts — based on PULSE workload data — and the available relievers are listed with their optimal inning and pitch counts. Sometimes a game gets out of hand — that’s where the emergency pitchers come in. They’re technically available, but it isn’t optimal to use them based on their current workloads.
A game doesn’t always go according to plan, and coaches have to be flexible. PULSE gives coaches the ability to make smart decisions for their game plan, and for when the game gets out of hand.
By using PULSE, Kyle and the Reds coaches have been able to manage their staff smartly and effectively across all levels. From adjusting throwing programs between outings, to managing pitcher usage in-game, and even fine-tuning the pregame routines of his pitchers, PULSE has been invaluable to the Reds this year.
Boddy’s thoughts about PULSE best sum up the success of the Reds implementation:
“It’s really absurd how much value PULSE confers and illustrates how we should actually be managing pitcher usage in games,” Boddy said. “It allows us to make smart decisions about how we use and prepare our pitchers that we wouldn’t otherwise have.”

How to Develop a Game Plan Without Advanced Scouting Reports,2021-08-04T01:02:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/developing-game-plan-without-advanced-scouting-reports/,"When preparing for an upcoming series as a pitching staff, the more information, the better. But unless you’re in professional baseball or at a Division I school, oftentimes you are left with the stat line from the league website. In the absence of advanced scouting reports and batted ball data, coaches and staff must look elsewhere to formulate a game plan.
One place to look is directly at hitters’ swings. Reading those swings can provide the necessary context on how to attack the team’s lineup.
Oftentimes while coaching junior college baseball, I’d pull the starting pitcher and probables for that day to watch the opposing team’s batting practice. We’d watch round by round and attempt to pick out flaws and holes within the swings, as well as how hitters might cheat to certain pitches.
From there, we’d discuss how we could attack those holes based on that pitcher’s arsenal. In addition to watching swings, we’d look for how the ball was coming off of the bat. Does the hitter slice pitches away? Is he getting tied up on inside pitches during batting practice? Listed below are some of the things we looked for.
A common swing deficiency we saw was a pushy swing. The most obvious thing you’ll notice with this swing pattern is the hands working before the hips, or “not using the lower half.”
This could be the result of the hitter not loading their scap, which doesn’t allow for the top hand arm to drop down into their slot to create a level swing. These guys could also be starting with their hands too close to their body, making it tough to create space and load the scap.
Additionally, they could also have some negative side bend in their stance, meaning they’re leaning towards the pitcher, forcing the hands to travel down and create a negative attack angle.
As a result of these patterns, these hitters will make most of their contact out in front and will struggle to drive the ball to the opposite field. Because their hands commit early, sliders could be a good fit in two strike counts. They also could be susceptible to pull-side ground balls.
Feeding fastballs and changeups in could feed into their often-negative attack angles. These guys must have good timing and be very in tune with their swing in order to catch a ball flush.
Another common thing we saw was guys that pulled off the ball. This might look like a guy pulling his bat out of the hitting zone. These hitters’ torsos will typically pull up and across during the swing. Pulling off could also be a result of their hips over-rotating.
These guys will usually cheat to inside fastballs, and tend to do most of their damage in that area. They may also feast on hanging cutters and sliders, as these pitches tend to match their bat path.
Their point of contact will be near the front of or on the plate, as they struggle to stay through the baseball. Pitches with horizontal movement (sliders, cutters) located away are usually tough for these guys to get the barrel to.
The last most common thing we saw were hitters who collapsed. These guys are usually trying to get big and lift the ball, which can present some holes. These guys typically have a taller stance, and stand up through their swing. They’ll have too much side bend and dump the barrel with their top hand, creating a vertical bat angle.
This swing path will create points of contact out in front of the plate, and will top spin balls when they’re early. Look for a majority of balls to be in the air on their pull side.
When they miss, they’ll typically flare and slice balls to the opposite field. Due to their vertical bat path, these guys will most likely feast on fastballs down, so hold off putting in your sinker guy and maybe find a guy on staff with above average vertical break and attack the top of the zone.
Curveballs in the zone can also reside in the damage zone for these hitters.
While these are all common things to look for in a hitter’s swing, we have to remember that there is no textbook way to do things. Situational hitting also influences a hitter’s swing path, and he may not show you that during batting practice.
Oftentimes, it is a common approach for a team to preach going the other way (for right-handed hitters) with a runner on second base to move him over. In this case, giving the hitter something on the outer half would play right into the scheme.
With a runner on third, hitters are typically looking to get something elevated so the runner can tag up and score.
Understanding your arsenal and seeing swing characteristics of the hitter can help you prevent this from happening.
You could also look for swing flaws that only show up in certain counts. Does the hitter collapse in 2-0 counts? He could be trying to elevate and get big. Does he become pushy in 0-2 counts? Putting the ball in play could be a team philosophy. These are all things to consider.
Reading in-game takes can also be revealing.
In this picture, we see Fernando Tatis Jr. “biting.” Seeing a hitter bite on a breaking ball on the outer half of the plate could indicate that the hitter was looking for a fastball away, recognized it was a breaking ball and then held up his swing.
In this picture we can see that Aaron Judge couldn’t get a swing off on this pitch inside. This could indicate he’s looking for something lower or perhaps off the inside part of the plate.
And in this last picture, seeing Ronald Acuña Jr. react in this way to a fastball inside could indicate he was looking for something away and wasn’t prepared to see a fastball inside.
We have to remember that hitting and pitching are complex, and there is no textbook approach to either of the two.
The Vladimir Guerrero swing pictured below resulted in an RBI and him standing on second base.
At times, you will throw your best pitch with perfect command, and it will get mashed. At other times, you’ll completely miss your location, or throw a bad pitch that the hitter just misses. While everything we’ve covered can give you clues on how to get hitters out, you have to understand that shit happens.

ThiThis blog was updated on 6/3/2022 and was written by Dean Jackson and Kyle Lindley, edited by Michael O’Connell
Below is an example of what an Interval Throwing Program may look like.
It’s our opinion at Driveline Baseball that this type of program has three major flaws:
Let’s break them down:
Your first day throwing on this program involves two sets of “warm-up throws” and 50 total throws from 45 feet. If you split the difference on the warm-up throws and call it 15 throws each (10-20 per the document), then you are making 80 total throws on your first post-surgery throwing day!
The most common side effect of these types of programs involves soreness and setbacks due to the inability to overcome the volume of the program. This can create a vicious cycle of starting, stopping, and restarting a throwing program.
Our article detailing “pulldown” throws goes into a bit of detail, but players need to be tested at game-like intensities before they return to competition. We need to make sure that they are occurring at the appropriate time
Secondly, there is no monitoring outside of distance. Pitchers going out to 180 feet on this program do so at varying angles, velocities, and intent. Throwing at 40 mph or 60 mph at 60 feet should not be equal.
This program cannot be equally effective for the MLB pitcher who sits 95 MPH and the 17-year-old who sits 83 MPH. Other than different starting points, there are drastically different resources available to one over another.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also has its flaws as a measure of intensity.
Previous research has shown that the percentage of effort that a pitcher is trying to throw at does not correlate strongly with how hard the pitcher is throwing compared to their velocity peak (Slenker, Limpisvasti, et al. – Biomechanical comparison of the interval throwing program and baseball pitching: upper extremity loads in training and rehabilitation AJSM May 2014).
At 60% of perceived effort, pitchers were generating forces of 76% and ball speeds approaching 84% of maximum intensity.
Pitchers are really bad at estimating how much effort they are expending and consistently underestimate it. This should have profound implications for rehabilitation programs.
Programs are often written in a way that doesn’t account for the rest of a player’s life.
Some baseball players returning from surgery have a nice, smooth recovery process. Others do not. Some players’ bodies won’t let them progress for a few weeks. Other athletes feel incredible, and they feel ahead of schedule. It’s a rollercoaster to try and help a player along with  Physical Therapists and surgeons.
They are difficult to adjust in all areas because everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Because of this, there will often be some sort of setback due to throwing volume and intensity. After all, everyone will respond differently to a program. But we need to remember that other factors outside of the throwing program can also cause setbacks. Lack of sleep, varying nutrition, school load, or travel are a few reasons that can also cause setbacks.
The fact of the matter is tools exist today that can raise the standards of Tommy John rehab. We want a standardized approach but an individualized method.
The solution is to use technology to better track progress and make programs individualized. This means utilizing
Combined with subjective measures, these objective measures give us the best chance for the next revolution of rehab programs.
Using Pulse and a radar gun, we can monitor the following variables:
You can read more about the metrics on Pulse here.
We can use those to better supplement subjective measures by asking the athlete questions such as:
We can combine these to create the four main phases of our return to throwing program:
We can layer on more extensive monitoring with Pulse and Radar Gun inside these phases.
Arm Speed will be used as our primary monitoring tool until ~700 RPM Arm Speed. Reaching ~700 Arm Speed typically occurs after several weeks of throwing.
Once ~700 RPM arm speed is reached, we would switch to a combination of arm speed and throwing velocity. Arm speed and velocity would be used to continue progressing intensity through the remainder of the rehab. We choose ~700 RPM Arm Speed because that is approximately where Pulse Arm Speed starts to deviate from throwing velocity.
We would progress intensity using object data (arm speed and throwing velocity) and subjective data from that point on. Focusing on how he felt he was recovering, how his mechanics looked like his, and how his body responded well to the increased intensity.
The example below is from a return to throwing program with athlete Ryan Cloude. This example represents a sample of what can be done with a data-driven return to throwing program. The advice dispensed in this article would certainly not work for everyone for the reasons stated above. We know how weighted balls affect the torque on the arm and workload, the example program below only used baseballs.
Ryan Cloude is a 21-year-old collegiate pitcher. He has an interesting training history, having increased his pitching velocity from 83mph as a college freshman to topping at 95mph as a junior. In the middle of his junior season, he tore his UCL and required UCL reconstruction.
The goal of this phase was to build a throwing volume base at a low intensity. We start all our athletes off with a low threshold to set them up for increased intensity later.
Ryan threw 3x per week during this 4-week phase. We monitored Arm Speed with Pulse, gradually increasing from a one-session average of ~200 RPM and top 1/8th ~250 RPM to a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM.
Total throws per session increased from 25 to 90 from the beginning to the last day of the phase.
We built this phase of the throwing volume base established in Phase 1 by increasing the throwing intensity on Monday and Friday each week.
Once Ryan hit the ~700 RPM arm speed mark, we switched measuring intensity from Arm Speed to throwing velocity.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM to a one-session average of ~600 RPM and top 1/8th ~850 RPM. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 49.9 mph and top 1/8th 57.6 mph to a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th 76.0 mph.
Instead of throw counts, Ryan was given options between 60-90 throws on the higher intensity days. At the same time, lower intensity days progressed gradually from 90 to 120 throws. He did the max number of throws most days, except for three days where the daily notes had some variation of “another crazy conditioning at 6 am this morning, body felt dead. Stopped at 60 throws”—no arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
One week, the same intensity was repeated (instead of progressing it) because Ryan was exhausted from team conditioning and didn’t want to push it.
Return to throwing templates lack guidelines on how to make adjustments to the program. At times the adjustment doesn’t need to be because something went wrong with the throwing program. But other parts of a player’s life are still ongoing when rehabbing a throwing injury. Tracking these programs leaves a player and a coach in a much better place to make an appropriate adjustment.
The only difference between the schedule of this phase and the last is that instead of the weeks going HLH, HLH (higher intensity, low, higher, and repeat), they went HLH, LHL (higher intensity, low, repeat). This shifted Ryan from 4 higher intensity throwing days every two weeks to 3 high-intensity throwing days every two weeks.
There were two new additions in phase three. First, bullpens at lower intensity began in this phase. Second, we started to focus more on moving efficiently. We measure movement efficiency by throwing the prescribed velocity with the lowest possible arm speed.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~600 and top 1/8th of ~850 to a one-session average of ~700 and top 1/8th of ~ 925. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th of 76.0 mph to a one-session average of 69.6 mph and top 1/8th of 89.4 mph.
His volume options remained 60-90 on higher intensity days and 90-120 on lower intensity days. Ryan decided not to throw the max amount of throws on a given day: total body soreness from training with his team and getting kicked out of the gym as it was closing. No arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
Bullpen throwing velocity was dropped back to the high 70s, with two pens being thrown each week, and lower intensity days were added over a couple of weeks until Ryan was throwing five days a week.
Throwing velocity on main bullpen days gradually increased from a one-session average of 64.5 mph and top 1/8th of 77.4 mph to a one-session average of 74.2 and top 1/8th 90.9 mph.
We had phases that we wanted to progress through and a good idea how roughly how much we should progress over a certain period, but ultimately we let Ryan’s body decide if it was ready to progress or not.
If the prescribed intensity for a session wasn’t comfortable, we would not progress intensity in the next session (regardless of what the program template said). We would repeat the intensity (or reduce it) until it was comfortable. The main idea in the intensity prescribing process was “letting the door be opened” when Ryan’s body was ready and not trying to “kick the door down” and force a more intense stimulus on his arm before it was ready.
Other pitch types were added first to recovery days during this phase. Simply by throwing offspeed in flat ground or catch play/long toss work. Intensity and volume were gradually increased until Ryan was throwing at maximum intensity on the mound.
Volume options for total throws on each bullpen day gradually increased from 60-90 to 90-110, while volume options for lower intensity days stayed 90-120. Once Ryan’s velocity got back into the high 80’s a few bullpens turned into recovery days because he didn’t feel fully recovered.
The first live session versus hitters happened roughly 10.5 months post-op and went well enough that Ryan decided he was ready to face hitters in a game that counted for his team. The first outing versus hitters in a real game happened just before the 11-month post-op mark and resulted in 1IP 0H 0BB 3K.
After completing his return to play, Ryan reflected on the process as a whole:
“Having objective data to show my progress was massive for my mental state. On days where I wasn’t able to hit my goal or days where I felt I was so far away from being healthy, I’d be able to look back and see how much harder I was throwing and how much more arm speed I was able to handle.”
It’s widespread to hear athletes talk about the mental toll injuries took on them and how grueling the whole experience is. I believe collecting data to give athletes a good idea of where they are now, where they have been, and where they need to go can significantly improve how comfortable their experience with rehab ends up being.
Ryan also said:
“(I) loved having a progression based on how I was recovering and not a cookie-cutter program that’s the same for everyone.”
We’re attacking it via our integrated staff training methods, technology, and Driveline TRAQ – and results have never been better, both on the performance AND rehab sides.

How a DII Coach Used PULSE to Help Lead His Team Deep in the Playoffs - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-09T01:13:21+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/how-a-dii-coach-used-pulse-to-help-lead-his-team-deep-in-the-playoffs/,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of usage and data collection, PULSE was known as Motus. We will be referring to it as PULSE throughout this blog.
This blog will be the first post in a series that highlights successful implementations of PULSE in the past. The launch of PULSE is focused around making implementation easier — the same great insights from Motus, simplified.
The 2018 Tarleton State baseball program, like many Division II programs, had limited resources to spend on staff, recruiting, and/or technology. Unable to afford losing players to injury, Bryan Conger — then-head coach at Tarleton — knew he needed to do what he could to maximize performance while keeping injuries to a minimum. He found the perfect tool for the job in PULSE.
PULSE allowed him to build individualized throwing programs for all of his pitchers. It allowed him to optimize the pre-game warmup routines of his pitchers so they weren’t blowing themselves up before a game. It allowed him to manage the fatigue and readiness of his pitchers in-season so he knew who was fresh and who wasn’t
Most of all, it allowed the under-funded, out-gunned, and out-manned Tarleton State baseball team to make a deep run into the playoffs.
Conger knew that long toss would be the cornerstone of his players throwing programs. While the exact definition of long toss may still be left to personal interpretation, the one recurring theme is that it prepares the athlete to throw on the mound – either that same day or down the road.
But how far is too far? How much long toss is too much?
Longtoss prepares the arm to throw at game intensities through two primary methods:
Based on these principles, the ideal long toss program should expose the athlete to progressively higher throwing intensities that approach, or even slightly surpass, the stress levels experienced in a game. Throwing beyond that threshold though, would be overly stressful for the pitcher.
Using PULSE, Conger first set a baseline for each pitcher on the staff. Pitchers wore the sleeve during an outing throwing at 100%. This established the baseline for how much stress their elbows experience when pitching.
Conger then had each pitcher go through their long toss routine while wearing the sensor. Using the stress levels from PULSE, he was able to assess when a pitcher’s stress level went above their baseline. Some pitchers were limited to 200 feet, while others were allowed to long toss from any distance.
For example, two pitchers had the same in-game stress levels. When long tossing, one pitcher reached that stress level at 250 feet, while the other never surpassed his baseline stress level.
By optimizing his players’ long toss programs, Conger could be assured that his players wouldn’t be over-throwing in their routines and were preparing to compete in the way that best suits each of them.
The next problem Conger needed to solve was ensuring that his pitchers were actually completing their workouts as intended.
Most throwing programs have an undulating pattern to them – they alternate between lower intensity days and higher intensity days. The higher intensity days help pitchers build throwing fitness, while the lower intensity days allow them to recover while still getting some work in.
But there are a number of questions to consider when building programs for athletes:
Using PULSE on each athlete’s workouts, he was able to get insights that allowed him to evaluate if athletes were completing their programs as intended, as well as, compare the same workout between multiple athletes.
In one specific example, one pitcher was throwing too much on his “recovery” throwing days, which prohibited him from ever recovering — he was always worn out.
In another case, Athlete D’s high intensity days are consistently significantly higher workload than Athlete C. Rather than take away throwing from Athlete D on their high intensity day, assuming they still feel good and are performing well, Athlete D would simply take an extra recovery session in order to offset the increased workload on his high output days.
This information Conger had about his pitchers’ long toss routines and typical throwing workloads enabled him to make optimized programs for each pitcher to ensure they were ready to dominate.
The goal of the pre-season is to make sure your pitchers are ready to compete. For pitchers, this means getting exposed to game-intensities and building overall throwing fitness — or Chronic Workload.
Using the information Conger had learned about his players’ long toss routines and how they performed their throwing workouts, he built out programs that safely on-ramped each of his pitchers using an undulating program that ensured they were safely building throwing fitness over-time.
In season, the goal is to maximize the on-field production of your pitchers. This means ensuring that pitchers are not only conditioned to handle the stress of pitching in a game, but also not fatigued prior to competition. Doing this for 15+ arms with multiple games, bullpens, and practices is no small feat.
Throughout the duration of the season, Conger was able to use PULSE to make any necessary adjustments to ensure that his pitchers’ throwing fitness was maintained. This allowed Conger and his coaches to plan for the week to come but also make adjustments based on the previous week.
One example is when a starting pitcher had to come out of the game early – how do you adjust his midweek throwing? Altering midweek bullpen volume/intensity or adjusting midweek catch play and long toss are just a few of the ways you can use PULSE to ensure your arms stay prepared.
In a typical week, Conger would use what he called the “W-Program” to maintain a starter’s throwing workload. This consisted of higher volume mid-week work in order to keep a high Chronic Workload, while minimizing fatigue for game day
In the event of a shortened start during the season, there would be a much larger spike in Acute Workload in these throwing workloads if the same program is followed. How did Conger avoid this?
He had the starter throw two bullpens in order to accumulate slightly more throwing volume. One bullpen was at a relatively lower intensity while the other was similar to his normal mid-week pen. This ensured that the athlete’s overall throwing fitness stayed the same.
This same idea can be applied to many different scenarios – none more impactful than during the postseason. Being able to monitor pitcher’s workloads and make any adjustments along the way allowed for Conger to keep his best arms ready to go when it mattered most — a key factor for Tarleton’s deep run in the playoffs that year.
—
Using PULSE, Conger was able to keep his best arms healthy and fresh, priming a program with limited resources for a run in the playoffs.
In fact, Conger himself summed it up best:
“I was able to get more innings out of my starters, my best pitchers, without overtaxing them. They had better performance and more importantly, we avoided major arm injuries all season long, into the playoffs.”
With PULSE, we aim to bring these same insights to every program, while minimizing the need for extensive leg work to get a system stood up.

Pitching Training Velocity Results 2019-2020 - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-18T00:12:44+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/pitching-training-velocity-results-2019-2020/,"In the past, we have discussed some of the KPIs and metrics the Driveline hitting department uses to both quantify athlete results and measure trainer performance. In the pitching department, we focus specifically on a handful of metrics, all of which we will discuss in forthcoming blog posts.
When determining which metrics to prioritize, we wanted to make sure that tracking and reporting these internally would help us assess whether our current training strategies and protocols were working while ALSO helping us evaluate the individual performances of our skill coaches. We hold each member of the department and ultimately the entire company accountable for these results.
Do athletes get better? How good are our skill coaches? Are we improving all aspects of pitching development? This is what matters to us.
For now, we will focus on one thing: velocity. We know that velocity is one of the most important metrics in pitching. Previously, we have discussed how much value can be created by developing it at the minor league level. In addition, while it’s been a while since we did after-the-fact analyses of athlete results (2018 summer edition), as we gear up for the 2021 summer, we wanted to introduce a few from the last couple years.
This piece is strictly about how much fastball velocity was gained by pitchers who assessed, trained, and retested (at least once) at Driveline from roughly summer 2019 on. Of course, fastball velocity is not the be-all-end-all of player development, nor is it a focus for every single pitcher that walks through the doors at Driveline.
Nevertheless, it is an extremely important indicator of success at the major league level. To quote our past research on velocity’s impact on production: “A [MLB] pitcher who outperformed his fastball velocity projection [from 2013 to 2019] by +1 mph produced an RA9 that was .2443 points lower than expected, on average.”
Or, more simply, gaining fastball velo has an extreme impact on an athlete’s performance ceiling, so we take great care in monitoring it.
Given the variety of focuses of of our in-gym athletes, we standardize pitching floor velocity gains as a KPI using the velocities from our motion capture assessment. All athletes throw in the mocap lab on Day 1 (or when they are otherwise reasonably healthy and on-boarded up to game speed).
For retest purposes, we’ll generally retest players every 6 weeks (+/- a week or two) to assess mechanical changes and obtain a consistent measure of their throwing velocity.  Thus, the numbers below reflect athletes who have trained here for at least 1 such training block, which we feel allows enough time—given the nonlinear nature of gains—to capture notable changes without the day to day variation that is natural in the course of training.
We’ll look at some general stats to get started.
The chart below shows statistics for the athletes who’ve trained at Driveline over the past two years. We see that the average starting velocity and velocity gained while training at DL both climb from 2019 to 2020 (offseason and summer training periods). This off-season, the average stay for athletes was longer, which can likely be credited to an increase in long-term trainees related to flexibility and uncertainty around COVID.
Similarly, with the facility shut down for the first half of the 2020 summer, no athletes were able to get in two training blocks before summer ended.
Looking more specifically at the distribution of velocity gains by seasonal training block rather than over the athlete’s entire stay, we see those increases from 2019 to 2020 remain consistent.
The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile velocity gains (the dark orange vertical lines in the graphs above) are also indicated below.
Returning to velocity gains accrued during an athlete’s stay, the chart below groups athletes into mph increments and shows the number and overall percentage of athletes who fall into each increment.
Among athletes with at least one training block at Driveline, 52% gained more than 1 mph in their retest, 27% maintained about the same velo (+/- 1 mph), and 21% lost velocity in the last mocap retest of their stay.
We see that athletes who train at the facility for longer gain more velocity—on average—than those who stay for shorter periods of time.
Another notable trend that we’ve observed in the past and which holds true in this sample of athletes is that it’s generally tougher to gain velocity for hard throwers. This is due to a variety of factors, including the relative lack of low hanging fruit to address mechanically or physically, along with the fact that harder throwers may be more focused on other areas of development, such as pitch design, command, or simply getting game-like reps to prepare for the season.
A number of athletes have trained with us across multiple trips to the gym, often including online training in-between to continue working towards their goals.
To include the progress of these athletes over a longer time period, we can also compare all athletes’ first mocap on file (in this case since April 2019) with their most recent mocap.
The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are again marked with dark orange lines and are shown in the table below—with athletes gaining 1.8 mph on average (mean gain).
As above, we can gain a bit more insight by also considering how long athletes had between their first and last mocaps.
We see athletes with a longer Driveline training history on average had greater gains across each of the buckets. For the 35 athletes who have trained with us over the course of several off-seasons or over a full gap year (more than 200 days between their first and last mocaps), we see average velo gains of 3.29 mph.
As referenced above, we see it’s more difficult for athletes to gain more velocity the harder they start off throwing. Even so, athletes who throw moderately hard are able to gain velocity on average (though these gains are naturally smaller than for athletes who start off throwing slower) over the long term.
Training for velocity is possible. We prove that here every single day and hold ourselves accountable, monitoring velocity gains as one of our Pitching Department’s main KPIs.  If you want to throw harder, this is the best place in the world to help you do that.
All that said, we know that velocity is not the only thing that matters with regards to being a successful pitcher and getting hitters out. Because of that, it is not the only thing the pitching department at Driveline focuses on when training athletes, and it is not the only KPI we use to evaluate our proficiency at improving performance.
In future posts, we will discuss our pitch design KPIs, Athlete Composite Scores, MPH per Varus tracking and how we quantify the athlete’s overall training experience.

Count-Dependent Pitch Quality - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-14T00:57:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/count-dependent-pitch-quality/,"In the first part of the series, we took a stab at the what (which pitches), when (which counts), why (quality-command tradeoff), and how (velocity, movement) behind pitchers changing their pitch profiles depending on the count of an at-bat. There were notable velocity and movement differences across the league depending on if the pitcher was ahead, even, or behind in the count. This piece will utilize Stuff+ to investigate how pitchers manipulate the quality of their pitches depending on the count, count-specific pitch quality behavior, as well as list pitchers who stood out amongst the rest of the league.
To review, the motivation behind manipulating pitch profiles with respect to the count can be explained by a quality-command tradeoff. While ahead, pitchers are often looking to exploit their leverage in the count by upping their pitch quality via some combination of velocity and movement to achieve a called strike or swing and miss while the penalty for a ball is low.
Simply put, they throw their nastiest stuff when the reward for a whiff is high and the consequence of a ball is low. On the contrary, when behind in the count, the penalty for throwing a ball is higher, therefore, command normally takes a slight precedence over pitch quality. In this instance, some pitchers may sacrifice pitch quality, within reason, in favor of locating the baseball to get back in the count.
By bucketing counts into ahead, even, and behind by pitcher on a league-wide scale, we can see pitcher behavior of pitch types in each count. Amongst all pitch types, pitchers displayed a 6.5 and 4.8 bump in stuff+ while ahead compared to behind and even, respectively. This backs the initial theory that pitchers get nastier while they’re ahead, specifically with two strikes, on purpose. On the flipside, there is little difference in pitch quality between even count and behind count pitches.
We can also see the influence that the count weighs on the pitch quality of individual pitch types. The quality of curveballs and sliders were most improved while ahead, while changeups were largely unaffected by count.  In theory, the “get-me-over” and “put-away” labels normally apply to breaking balls and, as we saw in the previous blog, breaking balls tend to have more intentional variation in velocity and movement than other pitch types. As a result, it makes sense that the quality of sliders and curveballs varies more drastically than other pitches.
Digging deeper, when we break down each pitch type by their respective counts, we observe that there is a very clear trend of increased pitch quality transitioning from hitter friendly to pitcher friendly counts.
For example, we see a major bump in pitch quality in two-strike counts when pitchers are looking to punch tickets, likely for two reasons. First, as shown in Table 1, pitchers consciously improve the quality of their offerings when they get ahead. Second, pitchers also throw their nastiest pitches with two strikes, tossing their best pitch type when they need a whiff.
We can see this effect quite clearly when looking at 0-0 CBs, where hitters see more “get-me-over” pitches with an average stuff+ for curveballs of 89.1, about 11 percent below league average in terms of pitch quality. However, in 0-2 counts, hitters see CBs with an  average stuff+ of 116, 16 percent above league average. The difference in stuff+ between the 0-2 and 0-0 curveball is just about 27%, a very substantial change in the quality of pitch, which represents improvements in velocity and movement.
Across all pitch types, pitchers will throw roughly league average pitches in all counts excluding two-strike counts and 3-0. The 3-0 obviously sees a massive drop in pitch quality, as the sole purpose of the 3-0 count is to throw a strike knowing most of the time (not all the time) the batter isn’t going to swing. In two-strike counts, all pitch types are thrown with an average stuff+ of 107-108.6, the highest of any other counts, and for good reason.
This gives us a general scope of league wide pitch quality behavior. Due to the volatility of pitch profiles, some pitchers stood out from the league by how they manipulated their pitches. The next section will identify outliers in the league, as well as in-depth examples of certain pitchers.
Listed below are the MLB outliers in changing the velocity, movement, and quality of their pitches. For simplicity, only ahead-behind count differences are included.
This table represents the pitches that have the largest differences in profile or pitch quality in ahead counts compared to behind. Within the outliers, some of them were rather interesting. Seth Lugo’s ahead-count fastball (150 stuff+) is nearly 50 percent better in terms of raw stuff compared to his behind-count fastball (104 stuff+), mostly due to a velocity difference of 2.3 mph. Yu Darvish throws his cutter almost 5mph harder with a gain of 4.7in of vertical in ahead counts versus behind. Cam Hill’s slider gains an additional 4.8 inches of sweep.
Tyler Clippard’s changeup sticks out because he throws a traditional changeup in even/behind counts and a split-grip variation in ahead counts. As a result, Clippard’s changeups have the greatest velocity and movement differences in the league due to a massive difference in spin direction and spin rate.
More on them in detail below.

83 MPH SLIDER: https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=890af37f-3f38-4e50-8a73-2a2685f5a520
Patrick Corbin’s slider has been one of the most successful and consistently effective sliders in recent years and has played a major role in his ability to be a successful big league starter. Looking at his splits by count, his slider movement from 2020 doesn’t change depending on the count, however it is possible it changes due to other factors (batter handedness, scouting reports, hitter swing feedback). However, in the table above, we can see that he throws the pitch substantially harder depending on the count. It is rare for a pitcher to add velocity to a breaking ball without sacrificing some spin efficiency in the process.
On average, Corbin throws his slider 2.6 mph harder in ahead counts than behind. For context, sliders averaged a bump of 0.57 mph in ahead counts compared to behind in the 2020 season. Corbin threw his slider 4.5-times harder in ahead counts compared to behind relative to the behavior of the league, which results in an increase of 12.7 stuff+ while ahead and a 9.9 bump in stuff+ even counts compared to his behind count profile.
Our model has had difficulty reflecting the effectiveness of Corbin’s slider, as it grades well-below MLB average across all counts in terms of pitch quality despite his continued success with the pitch. It is likely Corbin is able to achieve impressive results from a rather pedestrian profile by exceptional command, pitch tunneling, and his ability to manipulate the speed of the pitch to disrupt hitter timing in various counts.
Patrick Corbin has an absolutely filthy slider. Turns out, he’s been gripping it the same exact way since he was a kid. His dad (!) taught him the grip. It’s the same grip he uses for his curveball. So many cool nuggets came out of this Behind the Seams pic.twitter.com/aB6KcEzZIb

With a confirmed 10 different pitches, there’s little room on a break chart that Darvish doesn’t occupy and that’s clearly evident by watching him pitch. Darvish has stated he possesses a “slow cutter” and a “cut fastball,” which are both labeled as cutters, but not the same pitch in terms of profile and how he uses them. His cutter is one of the largest count-dependent profiles in all of baseball. Where some pitchers may alter some aspect of the pitch, Darvish significantly changes this pitch across the board for velocity, shape, and movement. For velocity, his cutter comes in, on average, 4.3 mph harder in ahead counts compared to behind. That manipulation of intent also brings a change in shape. His profile has a massive shift in spin axis from 98 degrees/9:16 (slider shape) to 145 degrees/10:50 (cutter shape), trading sweep and depth for lift and velocity in ahead counts.
It can be assumed the slower version is primarily for getting back in counts, stealing strikes, and locating with an easier profile to control. The ahead count cut-fastball is thrown with maximum intent to produce a swing and miss. While both types are above league average, his ahead count, harder cutter has a stuff+ of 135, while the behind-count, slower cutter is 120, so his ahead count cutter is 15 percent better in terms of raw stuff compared to the cutter he throws behind in the count. This is likely a compromise he makes in order to improve accuracy, as the importance of a behind count pitch is throwing a strike, rather than getting a hitter to chase.

Tyler Glasnow’s curveball is one of the best pitches in all of baseball. His 12-6 has an average spin rate just beneath 3,000 rpms, is thrown very hard, and has plus movement. When we break down his curveball profile by count, he saw one of the biggest pitch quality differences in the league, but was just beneath the minimum sample required for behind-count pitches to be included amongst the league outliers. The theory here is simple: he throws his curveball harder when he is ahead in the count, specifically, 2.1 mph harder, which results in his stuff+ skyrocketing from 140.59 while behind, to 205.70 while ahead, a difference of 65.1.

Mentioned in the previous blog, Sergio Romo owes the vast majority of his career success to his ability to throw a slider. Contrary to the norm, Romo throws his slider more than any other pitch in his arsenal, using it 64.6 percent of the time in 2020, good for the highest mark of his career. Since 2008, Sergio Romo has a .225 wOBA against his slider.
As you can see from the break chart above, his slider takes on many different shapes, due to Romo intentionally manipulating the shape and speed of the pitch. It is likely that Romo manipulates his slider based on a variety of conditions such as scouting reports, batter swing feedback, or batter handedness, but we also see the count of the at-bat plays a role as well.
Romo’s slider behavior is actually counterintuitive in that it decreased in quality last season when he was in advantageous counts, largely due to an increase in velocity while behind. In ahead counts, Romo shows an increase of both spin and spin efficiency, which results in a 4-5 inch increase in sweep in ahead counts. Where the trend from the rest of the league has been increasing velocity when ahead, it looks like Romo is going for more sweep when he is looking for a punchout.
In the interview below for Jomboy Media, Sergio talks about his mindset behind the slider when he struck out Miguel Cabrera for the last out in the 2012 World Series. While discussing his sequencing, he talks about his 0-0 slider he likes to throw “to get a strike if I’m trying to get ahead or if a guy hasn’t faced me, different look.” When he gets ahead on Cabrera, he says “I gotta throw him my best strikeout one right here.” While his pitch quality technically decreased when he got ahead, the bigger movement profile may be better suited for whiffs rather than raw run values, giving Romo a very specific slider for a very specific circumstance.

Hill’s slider led the league with the largest difference in horizontal break in ahead counts compared to behind. This is evident qualitatively by the width of slider movement on his break chart. When we look at his profiles, his slider gained an extra 4.8 inches of sweep in ahead counts due to a significant increase in spin efficiency from 44.6 percent while behind to 64.8 perfect while ahead. This change resulted in a jump of 20 stuff+ for his ahead count slider. During his debut season in 2020, Hill’s slider proved to be a major weapon for him with a wOBA of .168 and a whiff% of 43.3 percent. While it may not be directly tied to the success of Hill’s slider, it is possible his ability to produce greater gloveside movement contributed to the effectiveness of the pitch in ahead counts, especially with two strikes, as well as his ability to flash it for strikes when necessary.

The profile differences for Tyler Clippard’s changeup nearly jump off the page as he led the league in multiple categories. Across the board, the pitch is considerably different in velocity, spin, shape movement, and pitch quality. His ahead count changeup is 2.6mph harder while losing ~500 rpms, 10.6 inches of run, and 12 inches of lift. On paper, you would assume they are two entirely different pitches… and that’s because they are.
Upon viewing in-game video of his changeup during ahead counts and behind, it is clear he throws a split-finger variation strictly while ahead, and a circle changeup during even and behind counts. This explains the increase in velocity and massive drop in movement seen, as the split-finger grip kills spin and can result in a drop in spin efficiency.
The mindset of the split-finger variation while ahead for Clippard is likely to achieve whiffs with something harder with a more north-south movement profile than the standard changeup. Normally, pitchers make these changes to improve their offerings in two strike counts, while Clippard counterintuitively decreases his stuff+ by 30-40 compared to his changeup in other counts. Although the quality of the pitch decreases, it is possible the north-south, split-grip changeup is better suited to miss barrels in two-strike counts than the horizontal fashion of the standard changeup.
Understanding how pitchers change their pitches relative to count states is potentially important and can be a strategy in player development. While it may not be wise to recommend every pitcher should have two shapes of every pitch or throw pitches differently depending on the count, there are certain scenarios where manipulating the velocity or shape of the pitch can help improve an athlete’s effectiveness on the bump. However, this likely takes a significant period of trial and error with finding something that works and actually accomplishes what we want. A few points to consider:
In a perfect world, a pitcher locates their best stuff and maximizes pitch quality in any count. In reality, there’s a reason these trends exist at the highest level of the game. The game of baseball evolves over time and for good reason. Successful trends and strategies stick, negative ones fade away. If there were no underlying benefits of manipulating pitch types, it is likely it would not have started occurring or continue to occur in the game today at the highest level.

Case Study: How Kaleb Roper Used Online Training to Revamp His Fastball - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-05T01:01:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/case-study-how-kaleb-roper-used-online-training-to-revamp-his-fastball/,"In October 2019, Kaleb Roper was coming off his first year in pro ball with the White Sox. excited about what 2020 had in store before COVID-19 seemingly shut down the world in an instant. In a sudden turn of events, Roper needed a new plan. After training all summer and throwing well during instructs, he reached out to Driveline to begin his remote training program.
Roper, a right-handed pitcher, was drafted in the 29th round of the 2019 MLB Draft out of Tulane University. He spent 2019 in the Rookie League, where his fastball sat between 91-94 mph and topped at 95 mph. Coming out of instructs in 2020, Roper was throwing more in the 90-93 mph range, occasionally reaching 94 mph. His fastball has an elite movement profile, averaging nearly 20 inches of lift.
Roper signed up for Driveline online pitching training so he could spend time at home with family but still get world-class pitching training to continue his development.
We used the first six weeks to act as an on-ramp and reload period before getting into high intensity throwing. As a fully remote athlete, access to a biomechanics report or strength assessment was not possible, so during the on-ramp period, we had Roper go through an active movement screen testing for inefficient movements and instability. Pairing this with constant video feedback of the prescribed Plyo Ball ® drills and game film from 2019 and instructs of 2020, we built the baseline that would drive the decisions to make mechanical improvements in his delivery.
In the movement screen, we discovered Roper lacked single-leg stability and struggled controlling posture during various lower body movements, so we prescribed targeted warm up exercises he would do daily to increase stability and body control. On the throwing side, with his arm action we noticed that he tended to have slight “elbow climb” or high shoulder abduction between foot plant and ball release. With his lower body, the timing of his lead leg block was slightly late. This was a result of his pelvis being swung open with his lead leg, rather than driven open with his back leg.
The first six weeks of the remote program we focused on how “the system” of the throw works. This coincided with discussions over proper movement and mechanics, as the throwing intensity was low and the goal was to build back throwing fitness with the newly implemented throwing schedule. We wanted to make sure he was doing the drills properly, rather than just doing the drills just to do the drills.
The best example of this was attacking the high elbow climb in pivot pickoffs. There was not a specific cue given, rather a continual conversation about what it should look like, athlete education, and discussion of “feels” that seemed to accelerate the process of having a cleaner arm path.
The lower half discussion was a bit more technical and cue-filled. Since Roper would use his lead leg to initiate rotation of the pelvis, the plan of attack was to keep his pelvis closed longer so the back leg could do its job and initiate rotation. The two cues that were decided on were: hold the belt buckle towards the short stop, and keep the hips in line with a right-handed batter. The goal was to create and maintain tension in the rear hip longer than what he was doing at the time.
The on-ramp lasted into the first week of January 2020. After the on-ramp, we used the next three weeks to push high output throwing. Our goal was back-to-back 5 oz. pulldowns at 100 mph before shifting the focus to the mound. This phase would normally be longer given a full off-season (4-6 weeks), but because of unknown time constraints, we made the decision to better focus the remaining time we had making sure the on-ramp and pulldown work would translate to increased velocities on the mound.
The last weekend of January marked Roper’s first high-output day on the mound. We used the next five weeks to continue maximizing velocity once a week. We used the video and velocity from high-intent days to monitor week-by-week changes and set a goal for the following week. Going into March, Roper was already throwing at or above his 2020 instruct velocities in bullpens and was nearing his top fastball velocity of 95 mph from 2019. At this point, we knew there was roughly a month before he would have to report for spring training, so we increased the frequency of high-output days to twice a week to prepare for the spring training throwing schedule.
The month of March consisted of a 90-percent bullpen on Tuesdays, sitting in the 88-92 mph range, with the option to let no more than three fastballs go at the end, and a 100 percent bullpen on Fridays for the first two weeks. The goal was to make sure the increased frequency in high-intent throwing did not impact his ability to reach top end velocities on the Fridays before moving into a live-at bat setting. By the end of the offseason, Roper’s bullpen and live-at bat fastball velocities were all above his 2019 average and max.
Using Trackman data from two live sessions, we can see how the increased velocity improved the quality of the fastball in comparison to big league averages, using our “Blob” tool. The chart below shows how the fastball has not only improved since 2019—but since Roper left instructs. Over a similar sample size, the average velocity climbed, and Roper has been above his 2019 peak of 95.1 mph in each outing in 2021.We’re excited to see what Roper does this MiLB season.

Count-dependent Pitch Profile Manipulation - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-26T00:59:36+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/count-dependent-pitch-profile-manipulation/,"“That’s my put-away pitch”
“That’s my get-me-over pitch”
If you’re a coach, player, or have simply been around the game long enough, there’s a good chance you’ve heard a pitcher make comments similar to the ones above. There’s nothing too crazy about that, as, at its core, the idea is that some pitchers intentionally alter the shape of a pitch type depending on the context of a given at-bat, sequence, or game-state in order to gain a slight edge.
However, what’s less understood is just how many pitchers intentionally manipulate the shape of their pitches depending on circumstances, as well as how much they’re willing to adjust a pitch’s shape overall.
Rather than focus on pitch type consistency or overall variance of a pitch’s given shape (which includes both intentional and unintentional pitch manipulation), this blog will attempt to analyze just the intentional variance MLB pitchers impart to their given pitch types over the course of a given season. Specifically, we’ll look at which pitchers change a pitch’s basic shape on purpose, when they do it, and by how much they switch things up.
Before we can get into the intentional manipulation of pitch types, we felt it’d be important to touch on the natural, inherent causes of pitch shape variation that every pitcher experiences when on the bump. These factors include but are not limited to:
These factors contribute to changing a pitch profile unintentionally, while other components such as count, batter handedness, scouting reports, hitter swings, the number of times a hitter has seen a certain pitch in a single at-bat, and the times through the order penalty may lead to intentional changes of pitch shape.
Pitchers make these changes to improve pitch effectiveness through the manipulation of velocity and shape, as one version of the pitch may be more effective in the current situation than another.
If intentional profile manipulation does occur, we believe that the count has the biggest influence.
As mentioned above, pitchers often refer to a pitch they would throw in behind counts, and sometimes in even counts, as their “get-me-over” version. This version is thrown to steal a strike or when they have a suspicion that the batter is looking for a different pitch type. For example, the “get-me-over” version works largely due to the count and situation, as a batter is usually not sitting curveball in 0-0 and 2-0 counts, and a pitcher knows they don’t need to throw their nastiest curveball in that situation to achieve a positive outcome. Thus, the focus here is less on maximizing pitch quality and more on location and reliance on the likelihood that the hitter will take or, if they swing, be off timing.
In some cases, a pitcher will throw a lesser version of a pitch (in terms of movement and velocity) earlier in the count and “save the good one” for when they need a swing and miss, as they don’t want the hitter to see and adjust to the better version. In this situation, the “best one” or “put-away” version of a pitch is the one that is most likely to produce a swing and miss or strike out later in the count, when that outcome is more achievable and beneficial.
With this in mind, it is no surprise that velocity varies depending on the count; pitchers tend to increase the intensity when they’re ahead in the count as generally they are more focused on achieving a whiff, rather than locating. It is logical that a pitcher would increase intent on their heater in an 0-2 count rather than in a 3-1 count because the consequences of missing aren’t equal. If you miss in the 3-1 count, the batter walks. If you miss 0-2, you are 1-2 and still in command of the at-bat. Aside from velocity, there are pitchers who strive for a certain shape in a certain count.
While theoretically this strategy may not seem novel, it is still relatively unknown whether this change in intent actually results in distinct movement profiles. The rest of this blog will tackle normal variance in pitch profiles, significant arsenal deviations, and league-wide tendencies.
To start, we’ll use the common break chart to qualitatively view the deviation of a certain pitch, where horizontal and vertical movement are plotted from the pitcher’s perspective.
A pitcher who is consistent with their pitch shapes will have well defined clusters for every pitch type and standard movement deviation. Take Blake Snell’s break chart, for example, which features distinct clusters that can be clearly identified for each pitch type.
Rather than focus on pitchers like Snell who largely stay consistent with pitch shape regardless of the game and count state, the primary focus of this blog will be the pitchers whose break charts are not as clean. In the examples below, pitch type clusters are not as tight and instead cover a wide range of movement for certain pitch types.
This qualitatively indicates that the pitchers listed are frequently manipulating the movement of their pitches depending on game context, most likely intentionally and with purpose.
The pitches in the images above that stick out are Sergio Romo and Dinelson Lamets’ sliders, Zac Gallen’s cutter, and Yu Darvish’s, well, everything. Given the sheer magnitude of variation in each offering, one can infer that at least some proportion of the variation in the shape of these pitch types is intentional. In some cases, there is a clear trend in the movement deviation that demonstrates its purpose.
For example, Zac Gallen’s cutter follows a very specific trend in which he manipulates the speed and vertical break of the pitch. His cutter has shown vertical break ranging positively near his fastball, near zero like a slider, and then negatively nearing his curveball. Depending on the count, the pitch takes a shape that could be classified objectively as a fastball, cutter, slider, and even a curveball.
Given that we do see some evidence that pitches can change shape on a pitch to pitch basis, it’s important to understand how they change on a league-wide scale, as well as what is considered a significant change. First, let’s look at average league-wide pitch profile behavior related to the count.
As we touched on previously, it is of no surprise that the velocity of different pitch types changes depending on the count. When looking across all pitch types thrown at the MLB level over the past 5 years, we observe that the average pitch is thrown ~.5mph harder when ahead in the count vs behind, and ~.37mph harder when ahead relative to even. Specifically, curveballs and four-seam fastballs were thrown the hardest when ahead, while the velocity of changeups and cutters were least affected by the count. Overall, left-handed pitchers threw their pitches harder in ahead counts compared to right-handed pitchers.
We see a similar trend when looking at vertical break, as almost all pitch types in our sample are thrown with more negative vertical break while ahead in the count relative to behind or even.
For fastballs, sinkers, changeups, and cutters, this would be referred to as less lift. Four-seam fastballs, on average, showed a drop in spin efficiency of -0.039% in ahead counts compared to behind, which could result in the slight drop in vertical break. It is also common for athletes, specifically those with lower average spin efficiency, to decrease their efficiency as fastball intent increases. Knowing that pitchers tend to add velocity ahead in the count with their fastballs while potentially lowering spin efficiency, we might be able to explain the loss of lift.
For curveballs and sliders, this would be referred to as more drop or depth. Sinkers were the only pitch type with more vertical break (more lift) when ahead in the count, which is perhaps counterintuitive given the purpose of a sinker.
Less surprisingly, however, sliders and cutters were the two pitch types with the biggest change in VB from count to count. For sliders, it is likely that a pitcher wants to increase depth and downward movement to induce a swing and miss, while the same may be true for cutters as well.
On average, the count didn’t seem to have as big of an effect on horizontal break as it did on velocity and vertical break. As seen above, the average deviation in horizontal break is significantly lower than in vertical break, as all values hover around 0. However, the horizontal break of sliders and cutters was most affected in ahead counts, while all other pitch types were essentially unaffected. It is possible given the abundance of curveballs and sliders thrown harder while ahead that there are pitchers who sacrifice movement in exchange for the increase in velocity.
In order to determine whether a change in velocity or movement is intentional, we need an understanding of the league-wide standard deviations for each pitch type. Below is a table showing the average pitch variation in movement, spin, and velocity across all counts.
The pitches and metrics with smaller deviations indicate that they don’t fluctuate as much as other pitch types. The lowest expected deviation we found was mostly with sinkers, as they showed the smallest deviations in speed, spin, and horizontal break. This means that across the league sinkers were the most consistent pitch type in terms of velocity and movement. The opposite is true for changeups and curveballs, as they were two of the types with the most variance.
The lower chart indicates our cutoffs for determining significant, or outlier, deviations per metric. These numbers were multiplied by a z score of 2.326, using an alpha level of 0.01. So, in order to determine the frequency of sliders that were significantly manipulated by a pitcher within a given count or game state, we simply flagged pitches that fell above or below the thresholds above.
For example, the deviation of significance for slider velocity was found to be 0.959mph, so we simply flagged the pitchers who threw their SLs .959mph above or below their own average as significantly changing the velocity of that pitch within a given count. The same methods were used for horizontal and vertical break.
With a quantitative blueprint for deeming pitch type movement variation as intentional, we can evaluate all pitch types across all counts. This generates insights into what pitches and metrics are manipulated the most/least in certain counts.
As mentioned previously, velocity was significantly higher in ahead counts compared to even and behind counts. Excluding the cutter, pitchers threw 33.6% of all pitches significantly harder while ahead relative to even or behind. Across all pitch types, 28% of pitches were significantly harder in ahead counts compared to behind, while 4% were significantly slower. Cumulatively, 32% of all pitch types were significantly different in terms of velocity when ahead versus behind. When we include all counts, 21% of all pitches were either significantly harder or slower relative to the specific count state.
At the league-wide level, sinker velocity was most influenced by the count, with 38% coming in significantly harder and 2% coming in significantly slower when ahead versus behind. The four-seamer, slider, curveball and changeup were all 30%-33% harder while ahead. At just 10% harder in ahead counts, cutter velocity was least affected by the count. Overall, in terms of  both significantly gaining and/or losing velocity in all counts, sinkers were the most manipulated (27%) and cutters were the least (10%).
There are a few theories as to why horizontal break would be intentionally changed depending on the count. With breaking balls, there is a velocity-sweep tradeoff which describes an increase in velocity as usually requiring a sacrifice in horizontal movement, and vice versa. In ahead counts, some pitchers may opt to throw their breaking balls harder with less sweep, and some may throw theirs slower with more sweep. It is also possible that a change in horizontal break is the indirect consequence of changing intent and velocity with the pitch, so the main focus is throwing the pitch harder, but the movement possibly decreases as a result. On the other hand, pitchers could take a tick or two off their breakers to increase movement.
When looking at ahead-behind comparisons amongst all pitches, there were similar results for significantly more HB (22%) and less HB (20%), for a total of 42% of pitches significantly manipulated by horizontal break in either direction. This balance potentially describes both strategies of increasing velocity (less sweep) and/or increasing movement (more sweep) in order to achieve a whiff. Gloveside breaking pitches (sliders, curveballs, cutters) seemed to favor more sweep in ahead counts. Pitches with armside movement (four-seam fastballs, changeups, sinkers) favored less horizontal break while ahead.
Again, sinkers lead the way with 49% of pitches showing significantly different horizontal break while ahead compared to behind. Four-seamers, cutters, sliders, and curveballs saw significance in the 40%-44% range for either gaining or losing HB in ahead counts. In all counts, 34% of all pitch types were significantly manipulated by horizontal break. Overall, in terms of both significantly gaining/losing horizontal break in all counts, sinkers were the most manipulated (40%) and both sliders and changeups were the least (30%).
Nearly across the board, pitches tended to have negative vertical break (less lift, more drop) while ahead in the count. For gloveside pitches, curveballs, cutters, and sliders favored more depth (negative VB) while ahead in the count. This supports the theory that while ahead, pitchers may add more downward movement in an attempt to induce a swing and miss. Fastballs and sinkers were roughly split, with the same percentage of more lift and less lift while ahead. Cutters saw a drastic favoring of more lift while ahead in the count at 30%, compared to the 10% of pitches that showed less lift. Overall, in terms of both significantly gaining and losing lift in all counts, sinkers were the most manipulated (41%) and changeups were the least (27%).
When we take into consideration significant deviations in all pitch types across velocity or movement, 59% of all pitches are thrown with a significantly different profile compared to their profiles in other counts. Specifically, 73% of ahead-count pitches have significant deviation in velocity, movement or both compared to behind counts. 52% of ahead count pitches were intentionally manipulated relative to even counts, while 53% of even count profiles were manipulated compared to behind counts.
Given the intricacies of pitching strategy and pitch movement, it is no surprise that there is meaningful pitch profile manipulation occurring on a pitch by pitch basis in the big leagues. In this piece we aimed to provide quantitative context for which pitch types are changed, how, by how much, and when.

An Introduction to Seam-Shifted Wakes and their Effect on Sinkers - Driveline Baseball,2020-11-02T09:12:30+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/11/more-than-what-it-seams-an-introduction-to-seam-shifted-wakes-and-their-effect-on-sinkers/,"Chances are that if you’re reading this blog post, you’ve had the fortune of watching a Mariano Rivera cutter, a Roy Halladay sinker, or a Pedro Martinez changeup – generational pitches that seemingly defied the naked eye as they approached home plate.
Beyond having elite movement profiles, the three pitches above are probably best known for possessing “late” movement– the label often used by scouts, coaches, and players to describe pitches that seemingly change direction just before crossing home plate.
If you talk to most scouts who have racked up countless innings behind home, they’ll often tell you that this late, darting movement is a prerequisite to a plus pitch. Not only do scouts believe late movement on a pitch exists – it’s often what they look for when evaluating a given pitcher.
However, if you talk to most physicists, they’ll tell you that late movement is nothing more than an optical illusion – a function of Newton’s Second Law that deceives us into thinking a new force has been imparted on the ball mid-flight when, in fact, a pitch was moving exactly how we’d expect it to given the spin, release point, and velocity parameters of the pitch itself at ball release.
With such a gap between experiential and theoretical knowledge, what gives? Are there other forces in play that affect ball movement and have gone unnoticed after all these years? If so, are these forces significant, trainable, and noteworthy – or are we just getting caught up in an optical illusion?
Prior to the 2020 season, no large-scale evidence had really been found to support either side of the theoretical “unexpected break” debate, as no pitch-tracking technology had been able to reliably compare how a pitch should move (given it’s spin and velocity parameters at release) with how it actually moved during its full trajectory.
Enter Hawk-Eye, the new tracking system of choice for MLB in 2020, which finally gives us access to enough data points to help answer the question of whether pitches can change their shape on the path to home plate.
When we compare projected and actual movement against one another, we get some wild results that have the potential to change pitch design, arsenal optimization, and perhaps pitch evaluation as we know it. Here, we will be taking a deep dive on this effect, otherwise known as the Seam-Shifted Wake Effect, and how it interacts with a pitch that has faded out of the baseball landscape: the sinker.
To fully understand Seam-Shifted Wakes, we have to throw things back to a topic we’ve covered in the past, the Magnus effect (covered in more detail here: Spin Rate Part I, Spin Rate Part II). Most pitch movement is explained by this force, with the movement coming perpendicular to the Spin Axis of a pitch.
For example, for the above right-handed sinker spinning at an axis just higher than 1:30 (233°) at 100% efficiency, we’d expect it to move with just about equal amounts of horizontal break and vertical break (armside run and rise, respectively).
(GIF of Topspinning Cylinder From Wikipedia)
For the object seen above, we can observe that as more topspin is added (like that of a curveball), the airflow that moves towards the top of the object is halted, while the flow on the bottom is deflected upwards. As a result, there is a downward force on the object, reminding us of Newton’s Third Law of Motion (every action has an equal and opposite reaction).
Now, whether you know it or not, you’ve likely seen a very common, real-world example of wake. If you’ve ever observed a duck making its way across a pond, it’s likely that you’ve noticed ripples forming behind it to either side.
(Image of Duck From Reading Weather and Climate Blog)
It’s a silly example, but the image above shows the same phenomenon that happens with any projectile. On either side of the duck (or a projectile), there is flow caused by surface tension, which is likely symmetric in this case (unless the duck has unique features that cause otherwise). In this example, the displaced water behind the duck would be the wake. In the case of a baseball (or the object shown in the GIF), it is instead displaced air.
What makes a baseball so unique is the presence of seams in conjunction with smooth surfaces on the ball itself, potentially allowing for specific grips of the ball to create different movement profiles.
We can see this happening in the GIF below, where a cricket ball is shown with a rough side and a smooth side. As the ball interacts with the air around it, we can see that the turbulent airflow (shown to the left) sticks to the ball longer than the smooth airflow. This results in a deflection that forces the ball to move to the left (from our perspective). This effect on sports balls (and baseballs) was detailed in this paper by Rod Cross.
(GIF of Laminar Flow From Vertasium)
While the above is certainly applicable to all kinds of sports, it was a splitter thrown by Freddy Garcia in 2011 that really garnered the baseball community’s interest. While most splitters move to the armside with a small amount of backspin, this pitch moved in the opposite direction.
It is well known that throughout baseball’s history, many pitchers have employed “spitballs” or “scuffballs”, which oftentimes resulted in movement profiles that are irregular due to the alterations made to the surface of the baseball.
(The axis of rotation from this pitch suggests spin should deflect the pitch up and in to the batter, rather than down and away.)
In dissecting the above pitch, Alan Nathan was able to determine (using PITCHf/x data) that much of that splitter’s acceleration wasn’t explained by Magnus force, but rather laminar/turbulent airflow (or boundary layer asymmetry).
Dr. Barton Smith and his colleagues at USU have made it their passion to uncover some of the underlying components behind the “Laminar” pitch, publishing their research here, as well as coining the more descriptive term Seam-Shifted Wake in the process.
Their work has pushed the public’s understanding of Seam Shifted Wake pitch to new heights, potentially changing how we view and evaluate pitches for a long time to come.
(An image of Driveline’s visit to the USU  Experimental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in January of 2019. From left to right: Dean Jackson, Kyle Boddy, Barton Smith, Nazmus Sakib, Eric Jagers and Joe Marsh.)
With all this history in mind, the main concept to grasp is that when you break the symmetry of a wake (creating turbulence on one side), you can create force, and thus movement, that isn’t typical. This can be achieved through seam orientation, hence a “Seam-Shifted Wake”.
We are choosing to focus on sinkers to get the ball rolling due to a variety of reasons. First, most work on the subject of Seam-Shifted Wakes in baseball has focused on pitches that move armside, primarily sinkers/two-seamers and changeups. This would make a deep dive into sinkers logical, as we can take steps to corroborate already established, public-facing work. Additionally, the effect seems to be the most pronounced amongst sinkers, making them a logical jumping-off point into further study/analysis of SSW.
Second, to properly do a deep dive on breaking balls (especially sliders), we would need access to spin vectors. These are currently not available in public data provided by MLB, so that is a roadblock to a deeper analysis of those pitches. This is due to the fact that for breaking balls (and any pitch with sub 100% efficiency), some amount of gyrospin is converted to transverse spin during ball flight due to the descent and Spin Axis of the ball itself.
For sinkers, because Spin Efficiency is closer to 100% relative to other secondary pitch types, we don’t have to be as concerned about these effects taking place, better isolating the Seam-Shifted Wake effect. Additionally, the conversion of gyro to transverse typically moves pitches to the gloveside, while we’re specifically looking at an arm-side effect here.
Of course, there isn’t a variable that simply comes right out and says “SSW Effect”, so we have to do a touch of work (and make some assumptions) to see if this effect actually is taking place. We chose to imply the existence of a Seam-Shifted Wake for sinkers by comparing the Inferred Spin Axis (or Spin Direction) from movement to the actual Observed Spin Axis values provided by Hawk-Eye. We chose to call this difference (in degrees) “2D Axis Deviation”.
For both righties and lefties, a positive 2D Axis Deviation signifies a case where the movement of a pitch would suggest a more vertical Spin Axis than what Hawk-Eye believes actually occurred at release (controlled for handedness).
For example, if the Inferred Spin Axis for a particular pitch from a righty was 270°, and the Observed value was 250°, that would result in a 2D Axis Deviation of +20°. Pitches with a positive 2D Axis Deviation are moving more to the arm-side and/or down than we’d expect based on their directly Observed Spin Axis, implying the effect of a Seam-Shifted Wake. Pitches with a negative 2D Axis Deviation generate less arm-side and/or sinking movement than we’d expect.
(The above compares Kyle Hendricks’ inferred Tilt (left) to his Observed Tilt (right))
The league average 2D Axis Deviation in 2020 (the only year with Hawk-Eye data) for sinkers was ~17.6°. You can see the full spread in the density plot below.
(Distribution of 2D Axis Deviation for Sinkers thrown during the 2020 Season)
When looking at this effect at the player level, it’s interesting to see several well-known sinkerballers amongst the leaders. Kyle Hendricks and Dallas Keuchel have made careers out of their prolific sinkers, and based on 2020 data, it appears as though those pitches have gained additional movement through a SSW.
(Runs and Expected Runs are scaled on a per-pitch basis, whereas Runs Saved/9 is meant to be a proxy for how many runs that the pitch would outperform expectations by during a 9 inning game.)
In contrast, those in the Bottom 20 are all examples of cases where the pitcher actually generates less traditional two-seam movement on their sinker than their directly Observed Spin Axis would suggest.
(At the player-level, sinkers in 2020 averaged -0.004 Runs, 0.006 Expected Runs, and -0.735 Runs Saved/9)
Though it’s a bit of an inexact science, we scoured the internet for any documentation on grips for those pitchers that had the largest 2D Axis Deviations, and what we found was quite interesting.
Out of the Top 20, twelve pitchers were documented in some form of media (articles, video, Twitter) as throwing a variation of a one-seam sinker. While this grip comes in many forms, it primarily involves one or both fingers living on only one seam of the baseball, rather than sitting between or on top of the tracks of the ball.
This is surprising, as before, the poster child of Seam-Shifted Wakes among sinkers/two-seamers was the Laminar Express. And while some pitchers in the Top 20 still throw a variant of that pitch, it appears as though a majority of the other top deviators threw a member of the one-seamer family.
As an example of this, note the Edgertronic footage below of an in-gym athlete that had a >20° 2D Axis Deviation this past season. Despite the axes on his four-seamer and one-seamer having just a ~1° of measured difference at release, the inferred difference between the pitches amounted to nearly 30° during the 2020 season. This SSW effect helped the athlete generate nearly 5 inches of run and 6 inches of drop off of his four-seamer, giving him a unique GB-inducing weapon in his arsenal.
(One-Seamer (Top) is paired with a fourseamer (bottom) from the same athlete. Despite having the same reported axes, both pitches varied significantly from one another in terms of movement)
By comparing the actual run values of sinkers thrown in 2020 to the run values that we expected based on our arsenal scores, we can get a sense if this additional effect on the baseball adds any in-game value. The following plot tries to describe this relationship.
(Run values at the pitch level for Sinkers during the 2020 Season.)
As we can see, there’s a pretty direct relationship between 2D Axis Deviation and Run Value – Expected Run Value (our arsenal score). This suggests that pitches with a greater SSW effect outperform expectations. But, does this deviation explain anything in regards to just pure runs?
Controlling for arm angle, velocity, and pitch movement (horizontal and vertical), we found that 2D Axis Deviation does explain some decrease in runs at the pitch-level. Additionally, running the above features through a variable importance algorithm, 2D Axis Deviation consistently ranked ahead of release speed and horizontal break in regards to importance in relation to run value, coming in just behind vertical break.
(Variable Importance (in relation to Runs) at the pitch-level)
Given the abbreviated nature of the 2020 MLB season, we are going off of a limited sample, but at the introductory level, it does appear that Seam-Shifted Wake sinkers beat expectations and the magnitude of the effect itself plays an important role in predicting run values on their own.
Though we are just now scratching the surface with sinkers, it’s clear that other pitch types, primarily changeups and sliders, warrant a closer look. If MLB were to release spin vectors publicly, we could directly measure metrics like spin efficiency, spin based movement, and others that are necessary for an in-depth look (especially with sliders).
We are also hoping to conduct further investigation into the one-seam sinker at our facility in an attempt to see if that pitch (or grips/orientations within that family) allow us to “hack” SSW. Our current hypothesis is that sinkers within the one-seamer family, along with Laminar Express-style pitches, are more prone to taking advantage of this effect.
From a trainer/athlete perspective, the concept of a Seam-Shifted Wake can be summarized with the following: because of how the seams of the baseball interact with the air around the ball during flight, specific orientations of the baseball at release can give an athlete access to movement profiles that normally would only be achievable by shifting their arm slot or Spin Axis drastically.
There is certainly still more work here to be done, but it appears as though Seam-Shifted Wake pitches are real, and quite valuable if you can find the right combination of forces. Being able to validate this effect, bridging the gap between experiential and theoretical knowledge, is massive in understanding how pitches play at the major-league level, and gives credence to all those in the game that have seen this take place with the naked-eye for decades.

How to Throw a Knuckleball - Driveline Baseball,2020-10-06T01:58:50+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/10/how-to-throw-a-knuckleball/,"Welcome to Part 7, a special addition to the “How to Throw” blog series!
The knuckleball is a fan favorite and a rare pitch that few have been able to master. With insights from our in-house knuckleballer, John Soteropulos, we’ll dissect how a knuckleball moves and show you what it takes to develop one for yourself.
John Soteropulos’ Knuckleball
A knuckleball is a pitch thrown with little to no spin that can move unpredictably. Due to its low spin rate and what researchers call an aerodynamic phenomenon of “unsteady lift forces”—likely created by the seams—the ball will “dance” or “zig-zag” as it travels towards the plate.
Typically, this pitch is thrown with a similar release point to a fastball, albeit with less extension. A knuckleball will also have a significantly different movement profile than any other pitch in your arsenal, and you may find it close to 10-20 mph slower than a heater, with varying movement profiles. The unpredictability of this pitch confuses hitters and throws them off balance, leading to a high degree of soft-contact or whiffs.
The knuckleball grip is unique because it is by far the most individual. This distinctive nature has produced a diverse array of grips.
At Driveline, we’re fortunate to have someone on our staff with some experience. John Soteropulos, a hitting trainer here at Driveline, has been throwing this pitch for the last few years.
Here’s what John had to say about his grip and how he’s been successful in learning it:
“First, start by digging the baseball into your palm as deep as it will go. If you grip the ball out in your fingers and away from the palm, you will impart unwanted spin onto the baseball. Next, dig your nails into the leather. I keep my nails short, but most knuckleballers actually prefer longer nails.
After the grip and nails are in place, the ring finger and thumb act as auxiliary stabilizers, while the pinky is completely off of the baseball.
A consensus amongst knuckleballers is that the best way to settle on a grip is through rigorous trial-and-error  (frustrating: yes…necessary: very much so). To offer some personal insight, after six months of throwing bad knuckleballs using the exact Wakefield grip, I finally discovered that sliding my hand further down, towards the 2-seam, dramatically increased my consistency.”
At the end of this blog, we’ll offer additional grips to provide you with more options.
A knuckleball is thrown with normal arm action, but the wrist remains stiff until the baseball has completely left the hand. When thrown well with little to no spin, the ball feels like it slips out of your palm. You do not push a knuckleball with the fingers. Instead, you will feel like it “shoots” out as the ball leaves your fingertips. Lastly, as far as location goes, aim for the top-middle of the strike zone and hope for the best.
Here are some cues that may help you learn the pitch:
If you’re practicing on a Rapsodo device, the most important metric to monitor will be spin rate. We want to aim as close to 0 and 100 RPMs as possible. This means that throughout a ball’s flight, it should rotate at most 1.5-2 times. Anything above that and you might be limiting the pitch’s ability to move erratically, as a great knuckleball would.
Most knuckleballs will land close to the center of the horizontal and vertical break plot. This means the pitch has very little spin-induced movement, thus creating the opportunity for a plus knuckler.
The knuckleball can be a fun and exciting pitch to learn. While it sparks the interest of many players and fans, there is a reason why so few major-leaguers have been able to master it. This pitch is extremely difficult to learn and develop. It can take years of practice before being able to throw and command it within a game consistently. We hope you can use this as a guide to developing yourself as the next big-league knuckleball great!

Valuedefault | How to Throw Series | Driveline Baseball,2020-07-04T00:10:30+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/07/how-to-throw-a-cutter/,"Welcome to Part 6 of our “How to Throw” series! In our final segment, we will conclude with a discussion and analysis of cutters.
A cutter—also known as a “cut-fastball”—is a pitch that is thrown at a high velocity and moves with sharp, horizontal movement, or cutting action.
This pitch type is similar to a four-seam fastball due to its grip and release but differs from a four-seamer in that it has a slightly lower velocity and moves glove side instead of arm side.
Normally a cutter will contain predominantly backspin and gyro spin, with a slight amount of sidespin. The backspin on the pitch allows it to move like a four-seamer, while the slight side spin helps produce a small element of glove-side action, as a slider would have, thus producing a higher velocity pitch that cuts rather than runs.
This pitch type is used differently amongst big-league pitchers depending on their intent. For some, a cutter becomes their primary fastball, while for others it can be used as a putaway pitch similar to a breaking ball or a platoon neutralizer. Either way, an effective cutter can give you an edge when you step on the mound.
In our grip tracker database, we have three primary grip types for cutters. Shown below is “CT 1”, which 80% of our athletes use.
Gripping a cutter is similar to gripping a four-seam fastball. The index and middle fingers are used to impart force onto the baseball, which results in high velocity and spin. In this grip example, the fingers are positioned close together on top of the ball while the finger pads are placed directly onto the seams.
The most important factor is that these fingers are off-set on the pinky side of the ball, which helps induce backspin with a slight degree of sidespin. This is the core component of how this pitch creates vertical movement with cutting action.
Position the thumb underneath the ball for control, although its placement can be modified based on comfort. We see most pitchers either put their thumb directly just off-center or underneath the ball.
Place the ring finger on the side of the ball in order to help maintain control, while leaving the pinky finger completely off. But this grip isn’t a one size fits all approach—you should position your fingers so that you are able to hold the ball comfortably in your hand.
After you’ve found a comfortable grip, you should hold the ball with a good amount of pressure between your thumb, index, and middle fingers.
To throw a cutter, we want to think “Fastball” and pull down on the seams using your index and middle fingers as you get closer to release. A cue we like when throwing the pitch is to “yank” the ball down as hard as possible, as it should feel as if the ball “shoots” out of your hand.
Here is an example of high-speed footage of a cutter. Watch how the pitcher gets directly behind the ball and at release the fingers come off the side of the ball, helping impart the cutter-like spin.
As the ball travels towards the target, we would expect the pitch to move straight, but with late cutting action glove-side.
Additionally, if you throw from a lower arm slot you can expect to have greater horizontal movement and decreased vertical lift, as opposed to a pitcher who throws from an over the top release.
Using a Rapsodo, we can analyze the movement profile of our pitches. Cutters, which are highlighted in brown, possess a positive amount of vertical movement, mostly live to the left of the y-axis and have a small degree of horizontal break.
You’ll notice cutters are in between fastballs and sliders. Intuitively, this makes sense as this pitch type has the traits of both those pitches.
When a cutter has a high degree of run and little lift, it may be considered a “slutter”. This nickname is given to a pitch that holds equal qualities of both a slider and cutter.
Analyzing its movement profile will provide you a clear picture of how the pitch actually moves and, ultimately, how to use it when facing hitters.
Listed below are additional cutter grips used by our athletes in the gym.
The “Standard Between”, CT 2, uses a 2-seam orientation. Place the index and middle fingers in between the seams and slightly off-center. Very similarly, CT 3 uses the same orientation but the fingers are placed farther up the ball, closer to the horseshoe. Once again, you’ll find in both examples how the fingers are off the middle of the ball.
We recommend testing out different grips in order to feel the difference and help you in your development of this pitch!
Additional cues: “Focus on middle finger pressure”, “Think palm facing first base”, “Think slider”
“Standard Between” CT 2
“Standard Around” CT 3
This concludes our “How to Throw” blog series! We hope you enjoyed each segment and that you use this as a guide to improve on your pitches moving forward. Keep in mind that each pitch’s movement profile will depend on a number of factors.
It is up to you to practice, understand the different changes that can be made, and continue to discover what leads to the most success!

How to Throw a Slider - How to Throw Series | Driveline Baseball,2020-06-22T03:12:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/06/how-to-throw-a-slider/,"Welcome to Part 5 of our “How to Throw” series: How to Throw a Slider. In this segment, we are going to cover sliders, the breaking ball best known as one of the nastiest (and most valuable) pitches in baseball. We’ll analyze why sliders move so effectively and detail different grips that you can experiment with on your own.
A slider is a breaking ball that moves in many different shapes and sizes, predominantly with glove side action and 10-15 inches of drop off the FB.
This movement is created because the ball will rotate with a combination of side spin and gyro (or bullet) spin. Sliders are also usually thrown faster than a curveball and are roughly 6 to 10 mph off the fastball.
As mentioned, there are a few different families of sliders, any of which can be effective in a player’s arsenal if thrown with the right metrics. Since each SL type can be successful, it is especially important to understand what type of movement your pitch has in order to decide how to improve upon it.
The most common grip type among our athletes is referred to as “SL 2”. It is a standard grip that is held with the fingers slightly off-center between the inner seams. The middle finger is placed directly on a seam, while the index finger is on the leather. Both fingers are important at release to impart the necessary spin that leads to a slider’s desired movement.
The thumb is positioned for support on the opposite side of the ball and just off-center. Its position can be adjusted based on comfort. Compared to a curveball, the slider may not be tucked as deeply into the palm—although this varies between athletes.The knuckle of the ring finger is placed on the side of the ball in order to help maintain control, while the pinky finger is completely off. After you’ve positioned your fingers comfortably, you should hold the ball with a decent amount of pressure between your thumb, index and middle fingers.
Throwing a slider is similar to throwing a curveball, with a few minor differences. Take a look at the example Edgertronic footage below.
Notice how the pitcher’s hand is slightly off to the side; this enables the fingers to come around and pull down on the side of the pitch to produce side spin or gyro spin and, ultimately, the desired lateral movement.One of the cues we recommend is to “slash the zone” with the ball, or to “throw it like a football.” The pitch should feel as if it “slides” out of the hand upon release.Depending on your success, the pitch should move towards your glove side and appear to drop during the last few feet. If you don’t have access to high-speed video, you can pay attention to the type of spin and movement the ball has during catch play or bullpens. It might take time to develop a feel for this pitch, but further practicing and using different cues will help in your development.
If you’re prepared to throw on a Rapsodo device, you can analyze your pitch’s movement profile using the horizontal and vertical break plot. Note that the following graph represents right-handed pitchers and that for left-handers the results would be the mirror image.
The H&V break plot shows a spectrum of different sliders, which are highlighted in blue and located to the left of the y-axis. As shown, these pitches (from a RHP) display negative horizontal movement and a minimal amount of negative vertical movement.
As stated earlier, there are varying slider profiles. Referencing the break plot, a “frisbee slider” would fall further from the y-axis, while a “gyro slider” would fall closer to the centerpoint and a “slutter” would fall above the x-axis with a slight amount of horizontal movement. Lastly, a slurve would end up in between the blue and yellow baseballs above.
We should note that, while some slider types outperform others across a given sample (for example, frisbees tend to outperform slurves), every pitcher will find a grip and SL type that is best suited to their skills, arsenal, and comfort level (not every slurve is worse than a frisbee).
This analysis should give you an understanding of the different types so that you can analyze them when you practice, and ultimately decide what is most effective for you.
We’ve seen up to six different distinct slider variations, check out the video below to learn about them!
Below we have listed additional grips and cues. You’ll notice five other slider grip types. Each grip will vary between either seam orientation or index finger usage.
The differences between SL 1, 2, 3 and 6 are seam position. While both the index and middle fingers are placed onto the ball, their location differs. SL 1 is held similarly to a close four-seam fastball grip. The fingers are off-set to the side of the ball, with the finger pads positioned on the seams.
SL 3 has the fingers placed between the inner seams, but unlike in SL 2, they are farther up and closer to the horseshoe. SL 6 continues along that same path, and in this case utilizes the majority of the horseshoe.
SL 4 and SL 5 share commonalities with grips 3 and 6 in regard to placement on the ball, but the main distinguishing factor is the use of the index finger. This type of grip starts to resemble a “spiked slider.”
In those examples, by digging the tip of the finger into the ball the pitch becomes “spiked.” The amount of pressure imparted by the fingertip will vary between athletes based on comfort. Since most of the work imparting spin is done by the middle finger, you’ll normally see it positioned on a seam, while the “spiked” index finger gets out of the way and allows the middle finger to maximize its force onto the ball.
Additional cues: “Throw the back of the hand”, “Throw it like a football”, “Pull on the side of the ball”, “Slash the zone in half diagonally”
“Standard Offset” SL 1
“Standard Around” SL 3
“Standard Spike” SL 4
“Horseshoe Spike” SL 5
“Horseshoe Standard” SL 6
The slider is a pitch that can present a range of movement profiles, but will mainly display an element of glove side sweep and a noticeable amount of drop relative to the FB. A mastered slider can be a weapon for any pitcher. Understanding why this pitch type moves and how to throw it can provide the momentum you need to create one for yourself!

How to Throw a Curveball - Driveline Baseball,2020-06-18T03:32:06+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/06/how-to-throw-a-curveball/,"Welcome to Part 4 of our “How to Throw” series. In this post, we’ll be discussing curveballs, one of the most popular breaking pitches. The following information will serve as a guide and provide details helping you to create a quality curveball of your own.
A curveball is a breaking pitch that possesses strong downwards movement. While fastballs are thrown with backspin to create lift, a curve is customarily thrown with topspin to induce drop. Topspin is what causes a baseball to move downwards (aided by the force of gravity) as it approaches home plate.
Typically, this pitch type is thrown with a similar release point as a fastball, albeit with slightly less extension. A curveball will also have a significantly different movement profile relative to a player’s FB, as most pitchers will throw it 10 to 15 mph slower than their heater, with about 25 inches of vertical separation. The differences between the two pitches help deceive hitters, leaving them wondering what exactly happened.
If you are familiar with this pitch, you’ve likely heard of the “12-6” or “knuckle” curve. The varying names give the correct impression that there can be multiple ways to throw a curveball. At Driveline, we’re able to account for differing grips and ball orientations using our grip tracker database.
The most common grip used by our athletes is “CB 1.” A standard grip to many, the middle and index fingers are placed strategically onto the ball. The middle finger leverages the seams, while the index is placed on the leather. These two fingers are used side by side to induce maximum amounts of force in order to generate spin.
It’s important to remember that to create greater movement, we want to produce as much spin as possible. Doing so will allow us to craft an effective curveball.
The thumb is positioned on the opposite side of the ball, leveraging a seam as well. One thing to note is that the ball is tucked into the palm. In other words, there is little to no space between the palm (or the bottom of the finger) and the ball.
Having the ball tucked into the hand enables the pitcher to impart greater pressure onto the ball, which is used to generate velocity and spin.
The knuckle of the ring finger is placed on the side of the ball in order to help maintain control, while the pinky finger is completely off. After you’ve positioned your fingers comfortably, you should hold the ball with a good amount of pressure between your thumb, index, and middle fingers.
A curveball is uniquely released compared to fastballs or changeups. Take a look at the example Edgertronic footage below.
Notice how the pitcher’s hand is slightly off to the side. This enables the fingers to get in front of the ball and pull down on the pitch to produce topspin and eventually the desired top-down movement.
One of the cues we recommend is to “yank” the ball down with your middle finger, or to “throw the ball with the back of your hand.” The pitch should feel as if it “shoots” out of the hand upon release.
Depending on your success, the pitch should follow a similar trajectory as your fastball and drop during the last few feet. If you don’t have access to high-speed video, you can pay attention to the type of spin and movement the ball has during catch play or bullpens. It might take time to develop a feel for this pitch, but further practicing and using different cues will help in your development.
When you’re ready to throw on a Rapsodo device to measure your progress, you can track your pitch’s movement profile using the horizontal and vertical break plot. This graph shows us that curveballs, which are highlighted in yellow, would fall lower on the graph with increased negative vertical movement.
It is important to note that the break on a pitcher’s curveball will usually mirror his arm slot. A higher release point will lead to a more top-down movement profile, similar to the example above. This is how the term “12-6” is derived.
Conversely, the lower a pitcher’s arm slot, the more we’d expect a curveball to possess some horizontal movement. A curve that maintains close to equal movement horizontally and vertically can be known as a “slurve.”
There is no type of curveball that vastly outperforms another.
Some curves are thrown faster and maintain tighter or smaller break profiles, while others may possess large amounts of movement with lower velocities. However, the latter may give hitters more time to react.
To determine which curveball profile suits you, understand what type of pitch profile you’re able to create and what will be the most effective within your arsenal.
Below we have listed additional grips and cues. You’ll notice about five other curveball grip types that are common amongst our athletes. Each grip will vary between either seam orientation or index finger usage.
The main difference between CB 1 and CB 2 is the seam position. While both the index and middle fingers are placed onto the ball, their location differs. In CB 2, the horseshoe is leveraged along with the inner seams, which may provide greater feel and results for a given athlete.
Grips 3 and 4 share commonalities with the first two grips in regard to placement on the ball, but the main distinguishing factor is the use of the index finger. This type of grip starts to resemble a “knuckle-curve” or “spiked curve.”
In those examples, by digging the tip of the finger into the ball the pitch becomes “spiked.” The amount of pressure imparted by the fingertip will vary between athletes based on comfort. Although not shown, athletes can also place the knuckle of their index finger onto the ball as opposed to the fingertip.
Our last two grips, CB 5 and CB 6, feature the index finger completely off the ball. Some of our athletes have found this helpful as it increases their feel and success of the pitch. Since most of the work imparting spin is done by the middle finger, the index finger gets out of the way and allows the middle to maximize its force onto the ball.
Additional cues: “Get in front of the ball”, “Spin the ball with your middle finger”, “Throw with the back of your hand”
“Horseshoe” CB 2
“Standard Spike” CB 3
“Horseshoe Spike” CB 4
“Standard w/ Index Off” CB 5
“Horseshoe w/ Index Off” CB 6
There are many variables to consider in your pursuit of a curveball. Some factors that may come into play, such as comfort or finger length, can affect your progression. Therefore, it’s important to explore different grips in order to achieve the pitch you envision.

How to Throw a Changeup - Driveline Baseball,2020-06-16T00:45:21+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/06/how-to-throw-a-changeup/,"Welcome to Part 3 of our “How to Throw” series! If you’ve read the previous blogs, we bet you’re excited to begin learning about off-speed and breaking pitches. This post teaches how to throw the changeup—most pitchers’ go-to off-speed pitch.
We’ll provide you with the core information on what a changeup is, as well as walk you through grips and cues so you can learn to throw one for yourself.
A changeup is an off-speed pitch that is frequently used to pair off a pitcher’s fastball. As it travels to the plate, a changeup will typically mirror the same trajectory as a heater and mislead the hitter into anticipating a pitch that may be anywhere between 8-12 mph slower than expected. This gap in velocity causes a timing differential, which throws hitters off-balance and can result in soft-contact or swings and misses.
How your changeup plays off the fastball is critical. Still, it is additionally important to consider other components—such as your arm slot and the rest of your arsenal to determine how the pitch suits you. Changeups can vary by pitcher depending on the type of break they have.
Some changeups may have lethal movement that fades arm side, while others are more comparable to a “slower fastball” with very little movement. One thing to keep in mind—the greater the sidespin imparted upon the changeup, the more horizontal run it will produce. Creating sidespin is especially key for pitchers with lower arm slots, as it’s easier to throw a horizontally moving pitch from an already low release point.
The ability to maximize this component of your pitch will likely increase its effectiveness because we want to create a separation in movement from the fastball. The greater the separation, the more we can create two pitches that move differently to throw off opposing hitters. This can give you an added edge, rather than solely relying on a velocity difference.
As we navigate our grip tracker database, we noticed there tends to be a wide variety of preference among grip types. This means there is not one grip type that predominantly stands out among the pack. For the sake of this blog, we’ll look at the grip that is most frequently used (35% of changeups) in-house by our athletes: “CH 2.”
CH 2 sticks out to us initially because it is thrown similar to a two-seam fastball or sinker (“FT 1”) with a two-seam orientation, but the main difference comes in utilizing the non-dominant side of our hand. The middle and ring fingers are placed on both seams to leverage the ball for spin and rotation at release.
It is worthwhile to use the non-dominant side of our hand and remove the index finger to the side of the ball, as it brings about slower velocity and helps generate side spin. This will help you land in the range of anywhere from 8 to 12 mph off your fastball and maximize horizontal movement. Place the index finger on the side of the ball, comparable to the placement of the pinky on the opposite end. Both fingers will help stabilize the ball as it is being carried up from the glove to release.
Lastly, the thumb is positioned underneath the ball for control. The position shown in the video can be modified based on comfort. Some may look to place the ball directly underneath rather than off to the side, as a preference.Furthermore, you should hold the ball firmly in your hand. We recommend that your grip is not so loose that the ball would slip out, or too tight, which could limit the amount of sidespin you can generate at release.
As mentioned earlier, our goal is to generate as much side spin as possible to increase the amount of movement arm side and maximize separation off the fastball. To do this, we often cue athletes to “roll over the ball with your hand” or “swipe the inside of the ball.” Don’t be afraid to exaggerate those cues upon release. It may feel as if the ball might slip out, but comfort should come with practice.
Most right-handed pitchers will have a changeup that falls anywhere between a 1:30 and 2:30 spin direction. Greater side spin will come with a lower spin direction, and it may even inch towards 3:00+. This will be a critical factor in determining the shape and movement profile of your changeup.
Post testing out your changeup in a bullpen session with a Rapsodo, we’d expect this pitch to land slightly below fastballs (red baseballs) vertically and have greater horizontal movement. The changeups are highlighted in purple but depending on your arm slot their location on this plot may vary. Changeups for a left-handed pitcher would be mirrored across the vertical axis.
In sum, we’d expect a good changeup to have a distinct difference from your fastball and the greater separation between the two to lead to a more lethal pairing.
Lastly, we’ve provided additional changeup grips that are common amongst our athletes in the gym.
While holding the ball with a two-seam orientation is the most popular, we also see a four-seam grip used as well. In CH 1, the pitcher holds the ball similarly to a four-seam fastball and places his ring and middle finger on the seams.
Some players will also try to move the ball further onto the non-dominant side of their hand. In other words, the ring finger will move closer to the center of the baseball. We usually see this with athletes who are looking to create an increase in side spin and have large enough hands to do so comfortably.
Placing the fingers on-seam or off-seam is another variable to consider. Most athletes will find that leveraging both fingers on the seams enables them to produce greater feel or control of the pitch. As shown in “CH 3” and “CH 4”, this is not always the case. There are exceptions where an athlete may have greater success with placing their fingers off the seam. Each of these grips can be altered as they are slightly different.
In “CH 5” you’ll notice a completely different type of grip. It’s essentially a splitter and possesses a wide grip where the index and middle fingers are placed at positions stretched across the top of the baseball. This is common for athletes who have larger hands and wedge the ball comfortably between their fingers.We’d expect this grip type on average to produce significantly less spin and horizontal movement compared to other changeup grips. Thus, this pitch would drop or die out over the plate instead of fading arm side.
A splitter can be lethal when thrown correctly. While it is a difficult pitch to master, it can be a great alternative to a changeup, especially if you throw from a higher arm slot and find it tough to generate side spin or separation off the fastball. Remember, the biggest goal for splitters is to kill as much spin as possible. The less spin will lead to more dive or drop, thus creating vertical separation off the fastball and leading to hitters swinging over the top of it.
Additional cues: “Roll over the ball,” “Throw it with your ring finger”, “Pronate sooner”, “Swipe inside of the ball”, “Think about having a flexible wrist.”

Each individual will have to feel out the differing grips for themselves and decide if they should play a role in their repertoire. Athletes should use a grip that enables them to manipulate the ball and its movement to their desire. That will determine the grip that is best for you. Moving forward, we’ll continue to monitor the results of differing grips from our in-house athletes—and report back.

Do you teach a pitcher who primarily throws 4 seam FBs a CH1 and if a guy is mostly 2 seam he throws CH2? To keep seam orientation the same?
Andy – thanks for the question. Keeping seam orientation the same from fastball to change-up is not a major point of emphasis for us. Instead, we will make the decision considering which seam orientation more effectively produces the desired movement profile and is more comfortable for the pitcher on each respective pitch. Current research on batter perception does not strongly suggest that hitters are able to distinguish between different seam orientations, so we are not too concerned about them being able to read the pitch type based on a seam orientation difference between them.

How to Throw a Sinker or Two-Seam Fastball - Driveline Baseball,2020-06-05T06:49:33+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/06/how-to-throw-a-sinker-or-two-seam-fastball/,"Want to learn how to throw a sinker? In this piece we’ll dissect the differences between sinkers and two-seam fastballs and detail how to design a pitch depending on the type of movement you may be trying to create.
Along with four-seamers, sinkers and two-seamers make up the rest of the fastball pitch type family. While known for their diving and arm side action, sinkers and two-seam fastballs have very similar pitch profiles as both can be thrown with high velocities and relatively large amounts of sidespin.
What separates these two pitch archetypes is that sinkers will often display greater diving action compared to a two-seamer, which maintains lift alike to a four-seamer but possesses an element of arm side run.
Additionally, as part of most player’s arsenals, these two pitches are strategized to attack low in the zone and are recognized for inducing weak contact.
Due to the amount of overlap between sinkers and two-seamers, we combine their grip types within our database into one list for classification. We’ll cover the most often used grip for either and dissect the slight differences to help you learn how to throw both.
Our most frequent grip, classified as “FT 1”, is utilized about 75% of the time. Here is an example below:
We find that many athletes employ “FT 1” for both sinkers and two-seamers, but the most common separator is how the grip is used at release to create the desired movement. However, before we dive into that component, we’ll want to dissect how to hold the ball first.
Looking at the GIF above, we can immediately see that the index and middle fingers are leveraged onto both seams. This is standard for any two-seam fastball, giving it both a two-seam orientation and its namesake.
Similarly for a sinker, both fingers can be placed on the seams, although depending on preference, you may move the index finger slightly inwards.
The grip above will keep the thumb positioned underneath the ball for control, but its placement can be modified based on comfort. We usually see most pitchers either put their thumb directly underneath the ball or just off-center. Likewise, the ring finger is placed on the side of the ball in order to help maintain control while the pinky finger is completely off.
Additional grips are provided at the end of this post to give you more options to consider.
As you come through release, throw hard and think about getting on top of the ball and using your index/middle fingers to “roll over” to generate sidespin.
The lower your arm slot, the easier this may be for you. Generally, pitchers who have lower arm slots have a better feel for creating sidespin since their arm at release is already in a more horizontal position.
Below is a visual of two pitches that show the differences in sidespin. The ball moving at a 2:30 axis displays an increase in sidespin over its counterpart, giving way to a pitch that moves with the goal of diving and running action.
When throwing two-seamers, the process is a little bit different and mostly dependent on your release point. We want some degree of sidespin, preferably between a 1:30 – 2:00 axis, but just enough backspin to maintain a vertical element of the pitch that allows the ball to have lift like a four-seamer and move with arm side run instead of diving as aggressively as a sinker.
If you throw with a higher arm slot, you may want to consider inducing an element of “cut” to the ball. When a ball is thrown with “cut” or has a low spin efficiency we’d see the two-seam orientation shift, meaning the ball would have a degree of gyro spin. A cue to think of when trying to establish this type of spin is to “throw around the ball.” Here is an example of what we mean by gyro spin:
Notice how the axis on this ball shifts so that it is not completely perpendicular to the plate. Now if we look back to a ball that has a two-seam orientation and is thrown with enough cut, you’d begin to see the horseshoe on the side of the ball become more noticeable. This can help pitchers generate additional arm side run, especially from higher release points. Throwing a two-seamer consistently with added horizontal movement by imparting cut on the ball can be difficult to master however, and this type of adjustment is only recommended for higher-level throwers.
It’s important to consider that both sinkers and two-seam fastballs can fall similarly on a horizontal and vertical break plot. For a right-handed pitcher, two-seamers will have similar amounts of break both up and out versus sinkers which mostly break out and down.
The image below, shows where we’d expect a right-handed pitcher’s two-seam movement to show upon a Rapsodo. A left-handed pitcher’s two-seam fastball would be a mirror image of this graphic.
We’ve listed some additional grips below that can be used. Primarily, our pitchers will use “FT 1” about 75% of the time, but finger placement can always be adjusted based on comfort.
Like the four-seam fastball, most athletes will find that leveraging both fingers on the seams enables them to produce greater spin and “feel” for the pitch. There are exceptions where an athlete may have greater success with placing their fingers in between the seams on the leather as in “FT 2” or wider off the seams as shown in “FT 3”. Although, the wider you go the less velocity and spin we’d expect to produce.
This result makes sense as a grip like that would start to resemble a splitter, a pitch known for killing spin and velo. So while we recommend athletes to start with “FF 1”, discovering grips is an individualistic process and it is necessary to play around with differing positions in order to realize what suits you and your strategy best.
Close grip “FT 2”:
Wide grip “FT 3”:
Additional cues for Two Seam w/ no gyro spin: “Stay through it”,
Additional cues for Two Seam w/ gyro spin: “Come around it”, “think slider”
Additional cues for Sinker: “Get over the top of it”, “Roll over the ball”

Two seam across the narrow seams with variations?
We have not tracked gripping the ball across the narrow seams thus far, though we are incorporating more detail in the grip tracker moving forward (including evaluating a one-seam grip). Certainly, gripping the ball across the narrow seams may be more comfortable and produce a better result for some pitchers, so may be worthy of testing out for particular pitchers in the pitch design process.

How to Throw a Four-Seam Fastball & 4 Seam Fastball Grips - Driveline Baseball,2020-06-03T04:35:47+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/06/how-to-throw-a-four-seam-fastball/,"The four-seam fastball is the first grip any new thrower learns when they start throwing a baseball, making it important to know a 4 seam fastball grip. This blog will cover how to throw a four-seam fastball and four-seam fastball grips.
Beyond that, we’ll also look at different variations of four-seam fastballs based on their movement profile. Plus, some of the more common cues and adjustments that are used when looking to improve your fastball.
The four-seam fastball is the most commonly thrown and arguably most important pitch in a player’s arsenal. Synonymous with high velocities, a pitcher’s four-seam fastball typically exhibits some degree of backspin and arm-side movement.
A four-seam fastball differs from other fastballs, such as two-seamers or sinkers, in that it shows greater vertical movement, less sink, and a higher average velocity.
This grip is the most common four-seam fastball grip that we see at Driveline.
Depending on hand size, the ring finger is placed on the side or below the ball. While the pinky finger is entirely off. This grip isn’t one size fits all–the most important thing is that you position your fingers so that you can hold the ball comfortably in your hand.
As you throw your fastball, aim towards a target and pull down on the seams using your index and middle fingers as you get close to release. A cue we like to use when throwing is to “yank” the ball down as hard as possible, as it should feel as if the ball “shoots” out of your hand.
Here is an example from high-speed footage of a four-seam fastball. Watch how the pitcher gets directly behind the ball at release and throws the ball with close to perfect backspin:
We expect four-seam fastballs to move straight, but with increased horizontal movement, the lower your arm slot gets.
For example, if you throw from an over-the-top position, you’ll likely have almost no arm side run, in contrast to a pitcher who throws from a low ¾ slot, whose ball we’d expect to show a higher amount of run.
While each inch of fastball movement matters a lot, it matters more for older athletes who throw harder. Younger athletes should not only focus on throwing hard and to a target but also try to get behind the ball with backspin. Throws in the field will be with a four-seam grip, and we’d want to get good ball flight when playing defense.
If you’re throwing on a Rapsodo device, the movement plots below visualize where you’d see a four-seam fastball fall on the horizontal and vertical break plot.
When discussing four-seam fastball variations, it’s essential to understand that each inch of movement matters. So while there is less variation in four-seam fastballs, we can still find seven distinct variations.
It’s also important to understand that a pitcher’s arm slot or release point matters when discussing movement profile. The same vertical and horizontal break will look different to a hitter when they come from different release points.
Second, the movement profile will matter more as the player throws harder. If you throw in the mid-seventies, the movement profile doesn’t matter as much as throwing harder.
One of the keys to a great four-seam fastball is maximizing its vertical break for your release height. We’d expect that fastballs with a higher velocity and more vertical movement would lead to a higher rate of swings and misses.
At Driveline, we have been fortunate to collect an extensive database of grip options, classified by pitch type, to help us identify potential adjustments and find the grip that “feels right” to our athletes. While the ideal grip varies from athlete to athlete, it is often the case that pitchers are generally unaware of the various grip options available to them. Making them frequently rely on grips taught to them at a young age.
You should choose a grip that feels the most comfortable and allows you to throw the ball as hard as possible. Staying healthy, locating well, and throwing hard are the keys to a successful fastball!
First, we’ll review some of the minor variations that pitchers use when they throw a four-seam fastball.
“Stay behind the ball,” “Pull the ball down,” “Apply more pressure on the ball,” “Hold the ball tighter,” “Pronate sooner.”
Generally, the only differences we see with the pitch is whether the thumb is tucked or flat, along with the placement of the index and middle fingers on the ball.
We recommend, that athletes start with the standard grip on the left and adjust based on their comfort, ability to command the pitch, and movement profile.
Standard 4 seam fastball grip: FF1
FF2 – fingers closer together or even pressed together
FF3 – fingers widen on the seams
With the “close grip,” the index and middle fingers are placed side by side and directly on the center of the ball.
Conversely, a wide grip has the index and middle fingers placed at positions stretched across the top of the baseball more widely than in our standard FF 1 grip.
Often, an athlete will have a comfortable grip but need some cueing to modify the pitch profile to their liking.
For four-seam fastballs, there are typically two clear options.
The first is to try and up the efficiency of the pitch to increase the pitch’s vertical break.
The second would be to lean into some cut and create a relative cut profile.
Cueing involves trial and error to figure out what works best for the athlete.
Many athletes will cut their fastballs to some degree. Leading the coach and player to determine the best path forward.
Here’s a list of cues that may be helpful in teaching or throwing a four-seam fastball yourself.
Improving Spin Efficiency
Leaning into Cut
“Throw like a Changeup”
Think “Thumbs down to Catcher”
Put Fingers together (FF2)
Use a wider 4 seam fastball grip
Add Middle Finger Pressure
Just add secondary Cutter
It’s important to note that changing efficiency in a game setting is much different than doing it in practice. It’s pretty simple when your only goal is to up the efficiency on a Rapsodo. You’re not necessarily worried about the batter, counts or location as much as you would in-game.
As pitchers get closer to the season, coaches should ensure that any potential movement profile changes are stress tested in live at-bats or exhibition games. This gives the athletes some ability to experiment without it necessarily hurting results.
For pitchers that can’t get the efficiency up enough with a 4 seam fastball grip change, nor can they get it into like a true cutter profile. Giving them a sinker is a good bet. Having the coaching experience to know when it’s time to commit to this is vital.

Mastering The Axis of Rotation: A Thorough Review of Spin Axis in Three Dimensions - Driveline Baseball,2019-09-06T23:25:17+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/09/mastering-the-axis-of-rotation-a-thorough-review-of-spin-axis-in-three-dimensions/,"When we observe the trajectory of an incoming pitch as it is released from a pitcher’s hand, we inevitably witness the interaction of a pitch’s total spin, release angle, initial velocity, and axis of rotation within the environment.
We perceive all of this information simultaneously, and make a determination on the spot as to whether we think the quality of a pitch is good, average, or poor.
The simplicity of measuring pitch quality via the eye test mentioned above is likely something we take for granted, particularly when we consider how complicated things can get when we try to quantify a pitch by its individual parts, rather than the sum of the whole.
Despite this difficulty, measuring a pitch by its individual characteristics is a necessary requirement in modern pitch design sessions when we’re identifying areas of need, monitoring progress, and developing new pitches.
Many pieces have been written by analysts (and ourselves) to help overcome the questions coaches and athletes face during pitch design; however, Spin Axis, arguably one of the most important and nuanced pitch components to conceptualize, has largely been overshadowed and ignored in the public realm, relative to other pitch characteristics.
To remedy the lack of attention given to Spin Axis, we’ll attempt to address many of the misnomers and areas of confusion surrounding the metric. The goal here is to bridge the gap between what we know about a pitch’s axis of rotation and other attributes of a pitch’s trajectory.
Perhaps one of the most frustrating areas of confusion surrounding Spin Axis is knowing what to call it. The original definition of ‘Spin Axis’ used by MLBAM during the beginning of the PitchFx Era (2007/2008) described the term as the estimated direction of movement via spin, in degrees, in only two dimensions (more specifically, the x-z direction, or the plane perpendicular to the direction of travel).
As we now know, a pitch’s axis of rotation is not defined in two dimensions; rather, Spin Axis is determined in three dimensions and is significantly correlated with the orientation of the pitcher’s hand just before ball release (Jinji, Sakurai, & Hirano, 2011).
By incorrectly defining Spin Axis as the axis of rotation in two dimensions (shown on the left in the image above from Nagami et al., 2011), many have confused the term Spin Direction—which, we argue, is the proper name for Spin Axis in two dimensions—with Spin Axis itself.
Thus, to clarify any confusion regarding the definition of Spin Axis moving forward, Spin Direction describes the axis of rotation of an incoming pitch in two dimensions (the x-z plane), whereas Spin Axis describes the axis of rotation in three dimensions (both the x-z and x-y planes).
Since translating movement into degrees isn’t necessarily the most intuitive process, a neat shortcut developed by Bahill and Baldwin called the right-hand rule provides us a straightforward way to determine the Spin Direction of a given pitch without the need for advanced technology. As shown in the picture below, if one simply wraps their fingers around the direction of spin of a hypothetical pitch in the x-z direction and extends their thumb all the way out, their thumb will be pointing in the direction of the axis of rotation in the x-z plane.
(Image taken from Bahill & Baldwin, 2007)
To translate the position of this outwardly facing thumb into degrees, one can turn to the polar coordinate plot provided in the space below to find which degree coincides with where the thumb is pointing to.
In the example given in the picture above, the thumb is pointing straight up, which coincides with a 90-degree value in the polar coordinate plot and the correct Spin Direction measurement for that pitch.
If the right-hand rule is a bit too basic, there are two alternative methods you could use to find spin direction.
Of course, calculating a metric that references a polar coordinate is probably less than ideal for those of us who struggled with trigonometry in high school, so both Trackman and Rapsodo introduced a metric called Tilt to the baseball community. Tilt, which is just a slight derivative of Spin Direction, reports the axis of rotation in the x-z plane in units of hours and minutes instead of degrees.
By translating the polar coordinate plot so that 180 degrees = 12:00, 90 degrees = 9:00, and 270 degrees = 3:00, accurately determining a pitch’s axis of rotation in two dimensions ended up becoming much more intuitive for most people. As a result, Tilt quickly became the primary metric for coaches and players to describe Spin Direction.
(The image above [originally taken from Sons of Sam Horn] shows the Tilt and Spin Direction of a LHP’s FF and FT fastballs from the perspective of the pitcher.)
While the shift from Spin Direction to Tilt as the preferred way to report a pitch’s axis of rotation in the x-z plane has helped the metric gain popularity in the baseball community, it should not be forgotten by coaches and analysts that Spin Direction still contains value as a standalone metric as well.
For example, if you’re using a Rapsodo unit for pitch design sessions and only have access to Tilt, you’ll be unable to calculate averages on a per pitch type basis, given that the figures provided to you will be in units of hours and minutes (try plugging that into a calculator) instead of degrees.
However, if you’re aware that both Tilt and Spin Direction are calculated in the same manner, then you know that each hour of Tilt is equivalent to 30 degrees of Spin Direction (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour) and each minute of Tilt is equivalent to .5 degrees of Spin Direction (360 degrees / 720 minutes = .5 degrees per minute.)
Therefore, to calculate the average Tilt for a given pitch type, all you would need to do is convert the Tilt of each pitch to Spin Direction using the formulas provided below, then find the average Spin Direction of the pitch type in degrees and convert that number back into Tilt.
(Above is a step by step guide to converting Spin Direction and Tilt. As an example, take a RHP who throws a FB at 1:10. Since that pitch broke arm side, we set 12:00 to 180 degrees, we multiply the hour (1) by 30 and add that value to 180 (210). We then take the minutes (10), divide by two (5), and then add that value to 210. Thus, our Spin Direction is 215 degrees. To convert back into Tilt, divide Spin Direction (215) by 30 (7.1667), subtract by 6 and round down to obtain the hour (1). Take the numbers after the decimal point (.1667) and multiply by 60 (10) to obtain the minutes. Our Tilt is back at 1:10.)
Thus, both Spin Direction and Tilt can work in conjunction with one another when trying to better understand a pitch type’s axis of rotation. Knowing when to use each metric to your advantage can be beneficial when working through multiple pitch design sessions with a given athlete.
Apart from calculating Spin Direction and Tilt, the other main area of confusion surrounding Spin Direction is how it relates to arm slot. Most coaches and players are aware that there is a relationship between Spin Direction / Tilt and arm slot, but only one prior study (Brooks, Fleisig, & Pavlidis, 2015) has explored the relationship between the two in detail.
To further investigate the relationship between Arm Slot and Spin Direction ourselves, we estimated the arm slot of every MLB pitcher from 2015-2018 using methods similar to Cross (2015) and then bucketed these pitchers by average arm slot and player season.
With 6,752 player seasons containing an estimated arm slot classification, we further grouped these values by pitch type to produce the table below.
(The table above shows the average Spin Direction and movement profiles of pitch types by arm slot. Note, we extend Spin Direction past 359 degrees for CBs to account for ‘backup’ CBs. With our adjustments, we find that an over-the-top pitcher’s CB has an average Spin Direction of 387 degrees, which is the equivalent of 27 degrees on a polar coordinate plot.)
For virtually every pitch type, we see that a lower slot leads to an east-west movement profile (running FBs and sweeping breaking balls), whereas a higher slot leads to a north-south movement profile (high carry FBs and 12-6 CBs).
With the help of edgertronic footage, we can see exactly why this occurs. Lower slot pitchers have a hand and wrist orientation that is more parallel to the ground relative to their high slot peers, leading to more run and sweep. On the contrary, over-the-top pitchers have a hand and wrist orientation that puts them in a position to maximize top spin or back spin, giving them more carry on the FB and 12-6 shape on the CB.
(In the images above, we see how the differences in slot between a high ¾ release point [top] and a low ¾ release point [bottom] influences Spin Direction / Tilt. The uppermost image has a Tilt of 12:40, whereas the bottom image has a Tilt of 2:06.)
Clearly, there is a strong relationship between Arm Slot and Spin Direction, but the correlation between the two isn’t perfect given the mechanical and anatomical differences from pitcher to pitcher.
To investigate just how far a pitch type’s Spin Direction can be manipulated from its expected Spin Direction by arm slot, we took the seasonal averages of each MLB player’s Spin Direction by pitch type, paired that number with the expected axis of each specific pitch type given the player’s arm slot bucket, and subtracted the difference between the two.
With our new values, we were able to compare the differences in a player’s actual Spin Direction with their expected Spin Direction given their slot for each pitch type since 2015.
Our results indicate that MLB pitchers can add or subtract roughly 30 degrees from their expected spin direction on FBs and up to ~85 degrees on SLs (accounting for misclassifications). We feel that this is a sizeable amount of variance on a per pitch type level, lending support to the idea that pitchers can manipulate the axis of rotation on their secondary pitches without necessarily changing their release point or overhauling their mechanics.
This finding is important, as it tells us that altering the Tilt or Spin Direction of a pitch during a pitch design session can lead to significant changes in the shape of a pitch.
(The image above highlights the distribution of Spin Direction away from per-slot expectations by pitch type. Note, secondary pitches likely have inflated values due to misclassifications.)
Of course, when manipulating a pitcher’s axis of rotation on a given pitch type, Spin Direction / Tilt is only one of two metrics that needs to be considered. As mentioned earlier, Spin Axis is a three-dimensional concept, which moves along an x-y axis (or gyro component) as well.
Typically, the x-y component of a pitch’s axis of rotation is represented in units of Spin Efficiency or Active Spin, which is defined as the percentage of spin directly impacting the movement of a pitch (Rapsodo).
(The image above shows the distribution of Spin Efficiency at release for each pitch type in our Rapsodo database.)
In more technical terms, Spin Efficiency divides the proportion of a pitch’s spin components in the x and z direction (the square root of the sum of side spin and back spin) by the total spin imparted on the baseball.
Given that spin in the x-z direction (transverse spin) directly influences movement, whereas spin in the x-y direction (gyro spin) does not, Spin Efficiency is used by coaches and players to determine what percentage of spin imparted on the ball is causing it to move, as well as how the spin axis of the pitch is oriented in the x-y direction (towards home plate.)
Like Tilt, Spin Efficiency is an extremely effective metric because of its intuitive nature; however, it does have limitations in describing a pitch’s axis of rotation that are important to be aware of.
For one, Spin Efficiency does not provide any information to players and coaches about what the relationship is between a pitch’s axis of rotation in the x-y plane and movement. As a result, many coaches and players mistakenly assume, for example, that the relationship between Spin Axis and Spin Efficiency is linear and that a pitch with 50% Spin Efficiency has a Spin Axis that is directly split in-between being perfectly perpendicular and parallel with the direction of travel.
(Spin Efficiency is the cosine of Gyro Degree multiplied by 100. As a result, a Spin Axis with a 45 degree axis of rotation in the xy plane will not have 50% Spin Efficiency)
Unfortunately, Spin Efficiency does not have a linear relationship with Spin Axis in the direction of home plate (it’s actually calculated by taking the cosine of the angle that the spin axis of a pitch makes with the xz plane), which is why we prefer the metric Gyro Degree (defined in the image below) as a more descriptive and accurate measurement of the true Spin Axis of a pitch .
(Above, we see how Gyro Degree is calculated for two pitches from the overhead perspective. Pitch #1 [on the left] has a Gyro Degree of 45 degrees which is perfectly in between pure gyro spin (90 degrees) and pure transverse spin (0 degrees). The Spin Efficiency on this pitch is ~71%. Pitch #2 [on the right] has a strong gyro element to its axis of rotation, demonstrated by the 75 degree Gyro Degree. This pitch has a Spin Efficiency of ~26% [Image doctored from Nagami et al, 2011].)
Given the unique relationship between Gyro Degree and Spin Efficiency, most coaches and players are unaware of how the two relate to one another in terms of movement. As shown below, this has important implications when developing or evaluating a pitch type offering.
(The change in total absolute movement and Gyro Degree by increments of 10% Spin Efficiency. RHP only.)
Since cosine is more sensitive to changes at ~90 degrees than ~0 degrees, we see that players who throw a Gyroball would only need to adjust their Gyro Degree by ~11 degrees to gain ~20% efficiency, while players throwing a Fastball with 70% efficiency would need to adjust their gyro degree by ~28 degrees to increase their efficiency by the same amount.
The key takeaway here is that gyro-heavy pitches such as CTs and SLs should be easier to add Spin Efficiency to given the sensitive nature of Spin Efficiency at that level of Gyro Degree. Further, gyro-heavy pitch types will also have more volatile Spin Efficiency readings (a slight deviation in spin axis can have a large impact on Spin Efficiency) on a per pitch basis for the very same reason.
Another slight issue with Spin Efficiency is that it is indifferent to whether the Gyro Degree of a pitch is pointing in a positive or negative direction relative to home plate. While this is a non-issue for most pitches (LHPs typically spin the ball with a negative Gyro Degree, whereas RHPs typically spin the ball with a positive Gyro Degree), roughly 8% of all pitches thrown will have a Gyro Degree in the opposite direction of expectation given a pitcher’s handedness.
In particular, low slot pitchers will frequently reverse the Gyro Degree on their SIs and CHs, as shown in the edgertronic footage below.
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Video-for-Dans-Blog-.mp4
While this can be difficult to pick up at first without watermarks, our Driveline Edge tools are specifically designed to help us conceptualize the difference between two pitches with mirroring Gyro Degrees fairly easily.
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PC-Pitch1-1014-88.7-2353-29.31-Pitch2-1014-88.7-2353-29.31.mp4
(These two pitches have the same Spin Direction and Spin Efficiency, but opposite Gyro Degrees of 29.31 degrees [left] and -29.31 degrees [right].)
You might be asking yourself why the directionality of Gyro Degree matters, particularly when it’s understood that only Spin Efficiency, Spin Direction, and Total Spin determine how a pitch moves (minus drag).
Well, unlike what most players and coaches have been taught, gyro spin can contribute to the movement of a pitch depending on the pitch’s trajectory, the amount of gyro spin it has, and which direction the Gyro Degree is pointed to.
To briefly explain, because gyro spin (and all components of spin) stays oriented to the initial velocity vector rather than the actual trajectory of the pitch itself (which is manipulated by gravity and the magnus effect), some portion of gyro spin can be turned into side spin during ball flight, while some portion of side spin can become gyro spin during ball flight.
(The top image demonstrates what would need to happen for Spin Efficiency to remain constant throughout ball flight [the green gyro spin vector maintains alignment with the pitch’s red trajectory vector.] The middle image demonstrates what actually occurs due to gravity and release angle. This separation between gyro spin and trajectory causes a change in Spin Efficiency over ball flight, as shown in the bottom image [all taken from Kagan, 2017].)
For pitches that move glove side (Sliders & Curveballs), a small amount of Spin Efficiency is typically added during ball flight by the time it reaches the strike zone. For pitches that move arm side, a small amount of Spin Efficiency is typically lost by the time it reaches the strike zone.
(As Rapsodo is optical-based, whereas Trackman and FlightScope are radar-based, Rapsodo 2.0 is able to directly measure Spin Axis and provide us with Spin Efficiency at both ball release and plate crossing. The average change in Spin Efficiency throughout ball flight is given above.)
To gain a better sense of the magnitude of this effect, we bucketed breaking balls in 500 RPM intervals of gyro spin and calculated the increase in Spin Efficiency throughout ball flight.
In looking at the table below, we see that breaking balls thrown with at least 1,500 RPMs of gyro spin added ~8-10% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight, while breaking balls with less than 500 RPMs of gyro spin added just ~1% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight.
(The gain in Spin Efficiency during ball flight for breaking balls based on the amount of gyro spin they possess at release point.)
The effect size here is relatively small in terms of movement, as the change in Spin Efficiency equates to roughly 1-2 inches of horizontal break throughout the duration of ball flight. However, the key thing to note is that, in theory, this movement would occur “late” in a pitch’s trajectory. Therefore, these additional 1-2 inches of movement may be more difficult for the batter to perceive relative to more traditional movement. With a switch to an optical tracking system in MLB next season, we’ll be able to better determine whether this “late break” has additional value worth monitoring.
With these findings in mind, we hypothesized that if FBs and CHs typically lose Spin Efficiency during ball flight, they could, in theory, gain Spin Efficiency during ball flight if they were thrown with an inverse gyro degree. Depending on the effect size, this could give a slight advantage to certain low-slot pitchers who are able to manipulate the direction of gyro spin imparted on the ball.
To test this, we separated all inverse Gyro Degree FBs and CHs from normal Gyro Degree FBs and CHs and averaged the change in Spin Efficiency from release to home plate for both groups. As shown in the table below, FBs and CHs thrown with an inverse Gyro Degree in our dataset gained ~1.5% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight, while FBs and CHs thrown with an expected Gyro Degree lost 2.5% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight.
Given that the effect size between the two groupings of pitches only amounts to a ~4% difference in Spin Efficiency (worth ~1 inch of movement), it’s unlikely that manipulating the direction of gyro spin influences batter perception.
However, knowing when and how an athlete produces an inverse Gyro Degree on a specific pitch may be important when trying to develop consistency with a FB or CH. Thus, monitoring inverse Gyro Degree pitches may be worthwhile if you have the requisite technology.
To wrap up Spin Axis in the x-y plane, we believe that both Gyro Degree and Spin Efficiency serve a unique purpose in the pitch design process and are best used interchangeably with one another (similar to Tilt and Spin Direction). While Spin Efficiency is easier to conceptualize and translate to coaches and athletes, Gyro Degree is more descriptive of the actual axis imparted on the ball itself.
As you’ve probably gathered from reading this, analyzing the axis of rotation on a given pitch and putting it into proper context is both challenging and rewarding.
Since every pitch component makes up an important piece of the puzzle when designing a pitch for an athlete, it is critical that we understand how each pitch characteristic fits in with one another to put our athletes in the best position to succeed.
Spin axis is no different, and being able to more efficiently derive meaning and make adjustments to a pitch’s axis of rotation during the pitch design process can be a difference-maker when developing the right pitch.

Validating Rapsodo 2.0: Pitch Design Made Easier - Driveline Baseball,2019-07-31T02:34:47+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/07/validating-rapsodo-2-0-pitch-design-made-easier/,"As player development in baseball continues to rapidly evolve, the demand from coaches and facility owners to integrate sophisticated, reliable, and affordable technology into their players’ training plans has never been higher.
In recent years, many products have entered the marketplace attempting to capitalize on this new-found demand for data-driven programming, but few have been able to find an adequate balance between affordability and practicality.
Enter Rapsodo, which released its original optical-based pitch tracking system in 2016 and subsequently put reliable ball-flight metrics into the hands of coaches and players at a price within budget.
Combining a quality product with 3rd party validation, great customer service, and exceptional technical support, Rapsodo burst onto the scene throughout all levels of baseball and became a staple within the industry, popularizing the pitch design movement into what it is today.
However, despite the large sum of value that Rapsodo’s original unit has provided coaches and players over the past three years, Rapsodo 1.0 still possessed a few shortcomings that left users wanting more.
For example, the original Rapsodo unit had to be set up on a tripod roughly 6 ft behind home plate to accurately measure ball-flight information. This created issues when someone on the mound was wild or when space behind home was limited.
The original unit also had a relatively long processing time between pitches and a small window to capture incoming pitches. If the unit was not given enough time to process the previous pitch, the new pitch would not register. Subsequently, if a pitch was thrown a foot or more outside the strike zone, the unit would miss a pitch or provide only a velocity reading.
Because Rapsodo calculated pitch trajectory using images of a pitch’s spin rate and axis as it was released from the hand, rather than via the flight path of the ball itself (like Trackman and PITCHf/x), Rapsodo lacked the necessary information to calculate a 9 parameter fit of each pitch’s trajectory. Without these specific measurements, coaches and analysts were unable to perform several relevant analyses—such as generating tunneling metrics, comparing release point parameters, or incorporating release and approach angles—into their pitch design sessions.
To address and overcome some of the limitations with the original unit, Rapsodo designed and released the 2.0 unit (MSRP $4,000) prior to the start of Spring Training in 2019.
Rapsodo 2.0 now contains a more durable casing with a versatile setup location on the ground, positioned 15.5 ft in front of home plate. With a sturdier body and more convenient setup, pitchers no longer have to worry about hitting the unit directly with a pitch and causing damage, and facilities can finally use Rapsodo 2.0 in live or confined settings with no limitations.
To address the sizable collection of misreads and missed pitches, Rapsodo 2.0 also incorporates a faster processing time in between pitches and a larger window to read pitches headed well outside the strike zone. Indeed, as shown in the bar graph above, these changes are a net positive for Rapsodo 2.0 users, as several validation tests show that Rapsodo 2.0 is able to read roughly 79% of all pitches thrown in a given session, whereas the original unit can typically only read about 62%.
Rapsodo 2.0 also provides coaches and athletes with more data points for analysis. For all users, release height, release side, and release angle are now provided on the user interface, while vertical and horizontal break have been adjusted to accommodate the ability of the new unit to pick up the baseball closer to release point on its flight path.
For “Pro Level” subscriptions (a premium feature mostly designed for MLB teams), users are now able to view 9-Parameter Fit estimates generated by Rapsodo, as well as supplementary metrics such as trajectory-based horizontal and vertical break derived from the 9-Parameter Fit estimates itself.
At face value, the new features included with Rapsodo’s 2.0 unit provide users a large step up from the original model. However, with a new setup location, pitch-movement algorithm, and a suite of additional release-point metrics, it was clear that Rapsodo 2.0 needed to be validated before it could be fully endorsed over the dependable, original model.
Our Rapsodo 2.0 beta unit arrived in late January, and we immediately began pairing pitches between our new and original units to measure any discrepancies between the two systems. Unfortunately, despite high expectations, Rapsodo 2.0’s first validation test did not go as planned.
While velocity seemed to be within a reasonable margin of error between both units, estimates of spin- and trajectory-based movement were off by roughly 3-5 inches per pitch. Further, raw spin, spin efficiency, and plate-location errors were all outside of our comfort zone as well.
We continued to test and provide feedback to Rapsodo, who were willing to exchange our beta unit for a regular model and develop regular software updates to reduce errors. By the end of March, discrepancies between spin-based movement (again, the new default movement metric provided by Rapsodo) and legacy movement (Rapsodo 1.0’s movement values) decreased by 1-inch per pitch, and errors related to raw spin, spin efficiency, and plate locations were nearly halved.
While these improvements in the accuracy of Rapsodo 2.0 meant that most metrics provided by the unit were up to standard, there were still two major concerns with the unit that we felt needed to be addressed before we could consider the unit an upgrade from 1.0.
Namely, Spin-Based V-Brk was consistently inflated on FBs by roughly 2-inches per pitch, and pitches thrown from a low arm slot could not be read and measured by the unit.
Since one of these issues was a software error (inflated V-Brk errors) while the other was a hardware issue (not picking up side-arm release points), Rapsodo worked with our R&D department and training floor throughout the spring to test a variety of different setups, software updates, and hardware accessories to solve both issues.
By the end of May, Rapsodo’s team of engineers had developed a lift kit with a string of software updates that increased 2.0’s tracking ability of side-arm pitchers and eradicated the inflation bias of V-Brk on FBs.
With demonstrated reliability over the past month of testing, we are now pleased to report that the unit is as reliable as the base model when using it in conjunction with the lift kit and up-to-date software.
While using the lift kit may add an extra step during the calibration process, we believe that it is a must-have for coaches and players to ensure Rapsodo 2.0 is working up to its full capacity. Lift kits (shown below) are now included with every Rapsodo 2.0 unit sold from this point forward at no additional cost to the user.
The progress made by Rapsodo over the past four months has been impressive, and we believe that Rapsodo 2.0 is now a sizeable upgrade over the original model. That said, there are still items that need to be further tested to make sure users are getting the most out of this new version.
Namely, the 9-Parameter Fit estimates and subsequent trajectory-based movement metrics available to “Pro Level” subscribers are still susceptible to occasional misreads. While this is of no concern to non-MLB and minor league affiliate users, we do recommend that all users be cognizant of outliers when looking at Rapsodo’s new release point metrics during pitch design sessions for this very reason.
Further, a development in our most recent validation tests has indicated that vertical-plate location discrepancies now hover around 7-8 inches per pitch between Rapsodo 1.0 and Rapsodo 2.0. While this is perhaps somewhat unsurprising given the nature of how both units respectively reverse engineer ball flight, we felt it was important to note for users moving forward.
At Driveline, we invest a lot of resources validating 3rd party technology to ensure our coaches and players receive accurate feedback to improve performance. Often, this work can be frustrating given the black box nature and lack of customer support which many tech companies within baseball usually operate under.
However, as was the case in 2016, Rapsodo is the exception to industry standard. They were willing to work and communicate with us every step of the way to improve their product on a weekly basis.
Not only does Rapsodo’s refreshing approach speak volumes to where the unit is today compared to when it was released, it also provides us with an optimistic outlook for the functionality and validity of the system moving forward.
We’re excited for the future of Rapsodo 2.0, but most importantly, we’re now confident in the value it can provide today’s coaches and athletes as well.

A Deeper Dive into Offspeed Pitches: Types of Baseball Pitches - Driveline Baseball,2019-03-05T05:06:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/03/deeper-dive-offspeed-pitches-pitch-classification/,"After looking further into fastballs, now is a good time to look deeper at offspeed pitches—particularly curveballs and sliders. Answering this question will give us an idea on how many types of baseball pitches exist.
We’ve talked before that one of the key parts of an offspeed pitch is how the spin of the pitch aligns with the axis. If using a device like a Rapsodo, this shows up as useful or true spin. This means that raw spin rate can help you bucket a curveball or slider and can say whether they have a high, average, or low spin rate. But it doesn’t tell you too much more about the pitch.
Instead, the movement of a pitch is better described by two different categories of total spin: transverse spin and gyrospin. Transverse spin, which travels perpendicular to the direction of velo of the ball, is the main driver of magnus force. (This is more specifically described in Dr. Alan Nathan’s paper Determining 3D Spin Axis from TrackMan Data.)
Magnus force (which you are likely more familiar with) is only sensitive to the transverse spin, which travels perpendicular to the direction of the velocity of the ball (think of a four-seam axis).
The gyro spin is most easily seen by a slider, which spins like a football or a bullet from a rifle.

— Nick Pollack (@PitcherList) April 5, 2017
Because of this, the so-called true or useful spin relates to how a pitch moves, whereas gyrospin likely has little effect.
Now, while we avoid going further into the weeds on spin technicalities here, we are going to talk about how offspeed pitches are currently discussed and grouped into different types of baseball pitches.
Generally, the way we talk about offspeed pitches falls into different categories of sliders and curveballs: for instance, a sharp curveball, a loopy curveball, a slider with bite, or one that looks flat. This largely comes from lacking a way to measure pitches until recently, meaning that coaches and players have often defaulted to describing the offspeed pitches they throw by the grip and intention of the pitch.
How one describes a pitch doesn’t always map with the movement of the pitch. We can see the difficulties of that in MLB data. We should think of offspeed pitches as more of a gradient or a continuum. They blend into one another with different variations all over. This can be both overwhelming and exciting because it creates a different way to think about a pitcher’s arsenal and how that relates to designing new or tweaking old pitches.
How one is motivated to classify pitches is often a function of perspective. Traditionally, we’ve grouped segmented pitch types into common buckets—such as curveballs, sliders, changeups, etc.—which can be valuable if we’re trying to understand how a pitcher perceives fit for a given pitch within his arsenal and what his throwing intent is.
But, when working with newer ball-flight technology, we’re also afforded the opportunity to view and classify pitches from the batter’s perspective, which is arguably both more useful and descriptive in understanding the quality of a specific pitch.
For example, using 2018 MLB StatCast data, we can see that Jacob deGrom’s curveball (CB) and Chris Stratton’s slider (SL) are essentially the same pitch despite being classified differently. If we’re trying to analyze how a given batter will perform against said pitches, it likely makes very little difference to them how the pitcher describes it. From a batter’s perspective, those two pitches are perceptually equivalent (relatively speaking) and thus should be grouped together.
Vice versa, Clayton Kershaw and Matt Harvey are both listed as throwing CBs, despite the movement profile and shape of each respective pitch being quite different. If we were to run an analysis looking at what defines a “good curveball,” where these pitchers should locate their respective CB or how similar both pitchers are based on pitch type frequency, it is likely that we’d be misled if we did not separate those two pitches into separate classifiers. Scouts have understood this for years, using more specific pitch-typing nomenclature to classify pitches such as “slurves” or “roundhouse curves” more appropriately.
Run Values of 12-6 Curveballs – 2018 Season
Run Values of Slurves – 2018 Season
Run Values of All Curveballs – 2018 Season
Above are three heat maps (RHP vs. RHH) for the respective run values of 12-6 curveballs (like Kershaw), slurves (like Harvey), and MLBAM classified CBs. By getting more specific with pitch typing, we can gain a better sense of both the quality and ideal location profile of a given pitch.
Deciding how many classifications are needed to accurately bucket every pitch type is always going to be arbitrary, unless you use more rigorous clustering techniques. However, we can use more advanced ball-flight metrics to divide different types of baseball pitches more descriptively, like the chart below, will likely result in a more objective understanding of where a pitcher needs to add a pitch, where two pitches might be redundant, or where a pitch consistently needs to be to have success.
Using technology as a classification system can open up a lot of opportunities for more specific classifications. There is still time to learn the best way to classify pitches, or if there even is one. But we can clearly see that this information gives us the ability to dive significantly deeper into a pitcher’s arsenal.
Many coaches today won’t have access to this sort of information, unless they are in pro ball and are in an organization that makes this data available. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t start moving towards a different way to classify pitches. One of the more straightforward ways to do so is to think of offspeed pitch movement on a scale that is based on movement, instead of what the pitcher believes he throws with his grip.
We’ve established that a slider can drastically differ from pitcher to pitcher. These offerings may be classified the same, but they’re on completely opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of pitch movement. Some have substantial rise with little horizontal break, whereas others may have a few inches of depth and a large amount of lateral movement. We’re essentially considering everything from a true cutter to a slurve to fall into the bandwidth of what we consider sliders.
This graphic (RHP from catcher POV) from Mike Fast effectively displays the wide array of movement that sliders possess. The slider is susceptible to dip into cutter territory, as well as plunging into the neighborhood of curveballs.
Chart from the Baseball Prospectus article – Pitching Backwards: The Case for Longform Movement
Just as we see a continuum of movement for sliders, the same exists for curveballs. Some pitchers may possess a curveball with little to no drop and minimal side-to-side movement (near gyroball). Others may display very little depth and considerable glove-side action (similar to the sweeper classification). From a spin-induced movement standpoint, these pitches aren’t even close to our curveball classifications, but they receive the same title. Which can give another hint at how difficult it can be to group different types of baseball pitches.
For pitchers that produce solid drop on their curveballs, we often see them fall into three buckets: the slurve, the traditional curve, and the 12/6 breaker. The slurve typically possesses near equal parts horizontal and vertical while appearing more east-to-west than the conventional curve. With athletes who throw a traditional curve, the offering often exhibits more drop than sideways movement. The 12/6 breaker is the least common of the bunch. It produces little to no glove-side break with a great deal of downward action (thus the name). To drive the point home, each of the pitches described are curveballs from a traditional classification standpoint, but each has incredibly different movement profiles.
But this does require moving past describing pitches on specific grips and describing what pitches are by their movement profiles.
We can see how coaches need to live between “this grip means you throw a curveball” and the highly specific technical descriptions mentioned above. When taking a pitcher in and looking at his pitches, it is unhelpful to say he “needs to learn a curveball.” Coaches need a more specific goal of what kind of curveball a pitcher may want to learn, ignoring for a minute that some pitcher’s may have difficulty learning certain pitches because of arm slots or other reasons.
So, the feedback loop needs to be more of a back of forth of what profile a pitcher may need to gain or change a pitch to. Other considerations include how quickly or difficult it is for the pitcher to pick up that pitch and how it fits in with his other pitches. Remember, there is a difference between learning a good offspeed pitch in a vacuum and learning one that fits with pitches they might already throw.
We again come back to how vitally important communication is and how not having coaches and players on the same page is often a problem. We know that there tends to be a coach’s or player’s description of a pitch, followed by a technical measurement of how a pitch moves. These two don’t have to live in conflict, but there are sometimes bumps along the road.
It matters less how a player or coach describes a pitch as long as it’s clearly communicated. But there are layers of technical knowledge that are now needed to truly dive into the weeds of pitch movement to see how a pitch moves and compares to others. This creates a layer beyond what a player calls a pitch and how we can use technology to group different types of baseball pitches.
A coach might take a pitcher in, have him throw on a Rapsodo, dive into the numbers, and then see a specific movement profile that may need changing or a gap in his repertoire that could use a pitch of a certain movement profile. This is just another example of how technology is changing the game and requiring a slightly different understanding of what was needed before.

A Deeper Dive into Fastball Spin Rate - Driveline Baseball,2019-02-01T04:26:09+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/01/deeper-dive-fastball-spin-rate/,"In a previous article, we discussed the difference between cues and measurements as well as how technology is changing baseball. We now know that instead of simply repeating cues verbatim to players, learning more background knowledge of certain topics is needed. One of those topics is spin rate. As you’ll see today there are lots of layers that go into understanding how a pitch is effective.
We’ve previously covered some basics of fastball spin rate and spin rate of off-speed pitches, but it’s time for another look.
In this article, we first look at high-spin fastballs and ball axis, and then we move deeper into the complex nature of spin, axis, and movement. We also explain some of the nuance with high spin and its relationship to movement. This article intends to show how a concept, like spin rate, can scale from relatively simple to more complex when you really dive into the metrics.
While the available information and what’s relevant to each player scales per level, equipment, and knowledge, today we aim to show what you can learn from even relatively simple explanations, which will open the possibility to learn more down the road.
When a fastball is thrown with backspin, we can explain its vertical movement with Magnus force. The ball spins, pushing the air downward behind it and creating and equal, opposite force upward. So a good part of the movement of a fastball depends on how fast or how slow, called the rate, it is spinning.
This can have effects on hitters, which we’ve observed through research using a pitching machine with different spin rates.
From: The Effect of Fastball Backspin Rate on Baseball Hitting Accuracy: Higuchi, et al., 2013
Picture from: Baseball Spin and Pitchers’ Performance: Kanosue, et al. (Open Access)
Now the fastest spin rate used in the study above is faster than what we’ve seen pitchers throw, but the point still stands: hitters are more likely to swing under a high-spin fastball. We also see that hitters tend to hit more fly balls and have more swings and misses on high-spin fastballs, which is why they’re more likely to hit low-spin fastballs on the ground.
We can also look at the relationship of fastball spin rate (while holding velocity constant) and its relationship to swinging strike percentage and average launch angle.
Now, based on reading the above chart, it would be easy to conclude that high-spin fastballs should be thrown high in the zone and low-spin fastballs should be thrown low in the zone. However, this conclusion isn’t so simple, and we need to look deeper to find better context.
First, you’d need to control for velocity. We’ve seen that spin rate increases with fastball velocity, but it’s also easy to misapply basic lessons—especially if you are comparing pitchers with different velocities. This is largely why we like to use Bauer Units, to better compare fastball spin rates, because you can have pitchers that throw the same spin rates, and whether they are high or low depends on velocity.
Below is a simple example, showing how pitchers with the same spin rate but different velocities have different Bauer Units.
Understanding Bauer Units and how to judge spin with them gives coaches further context of the spin rate of fastballs. But, especially with fastballs, ball axis also needs to be taken into account—and it’s often forgotten.
There is a distinction between a high-spin fastball that has a high degree of vertical movement and one that does not. This is because of the ball’s axis.
So, it’s not just the spin that we want to focus on. We want to focus on the spin, what the axis is, and how that is related to the movement of the pitch. Even more specific, you can have two pitches with the same velocity and spin rate but have different movement profiles based on the axis of the ball.
Below is a pitch with a “1:00” spin axis and a 95% spin efficiency, based on Rapsodo metrics.
Below is a pitch with the same 1:00 axis and a 50% spin efficiency, based on Rapsodo metrics, giving it more cut relative to the pitch with 95% spin efficiency.
Now, video and some published research can tell us that the spin axis of each pitch significantly correlates with the orientation of the hands and fingers just before and at ball release. Which makes having a camera especially important when trying to piece together what ball tracking technology is saying.
When looking closer to see if a pitcher cuts his fastball we need to understand that some pitchers have essentially grown up cutting the ball when they throw a fastball, which is incredibly difficult to change when they’ve thrown thousands if not millions of pitches with that pattern. Other pitchers may have slight fluctuations in their release point, or fingers at release, that can change their spin axis, which can be adjusted given proper video and spin-rate feedback. This is important because one of the differences between amateurs and professional pitchers is the consistency of their spin axis.
The movement of a fastball will also be affected by a pitcher’s arm slot, or release point. As arm slot changes, so does the orientation of the hands and fingers at release, thus affecting the axis of the ball.
Assuming pure transverse spin, a pitcher who throws from “over the top” will have a nearly horizontal spin axis. A high percentage of backspin with a horizontal axis causes most of the spin deflection to be in the positive vertical direction. (That is to say, basically up.) With a more traditional three-fourths slot, we start to see more similar horizontal and vertical break values. This can be attributed to the axis shifting to a more diagonal position—meaning more sidespin. Lastly, a “low slot” or sidearm pitcher, will likely have a fastball spin axis that’s almost purely vertical. As a result, nearly all the movement will be lateral to the arm side.
As you can see, high spin rate by itself does not mean more positive vertical break. In this case, the pitch movement largely depends on the axis which the ball revolves around.
This was examined in 2015 in the Baseball Prospectus annual report. They used Brooks Baseball data along with arm angle measures of 25 pitchers (provided by ASMI). They ended up finding a correlation of .75 between four-seam fastball angle and arm angle and a correlation of .79 between two-seam fastball (sinker) movement and arm angle.
Lastly, how spin axis is measured depends on the technology used to track ball flight.
Both Trackman and Rapsodo measure spin axis but in different ways. Trackman follows the entirety of ball flight and infers spin axis from the trajectory. Rapsodo calculates spin axis directly, but infers trajectory based on the axis itself. Each method has its strengths and shortcomings, for example laminar flow isn’t accurately accounted for, but the main advantage of Rapsodo is that it can accurately measure spin efficiency. This is very helpful for designing pitches.
In short, knowing a pitcher’s spin rate on his fastball is important, but knowing his spin axis is also important because that gives you more context for how the pitch moves and how he can use it, or if it may be beneficial to try and change it.
Beyond the relationships mentioned above, we also know that spin axis influences both spin rate and spin efficiency. Essentially, the more you cut the ball, the more total spin you’re able to generate, often at the expense of transverse spin.
This means that a high-velocity pitcher who naturally cuts the baseball may have a significantly higher raw spin rate than a low-velocity pitcher with natural arm-side run, despite not actually being better at generating spin. In other words, a high-velocity, over-the-top pitcher who is actually less able to use a combination of finger forces and friction to add spin on the ball at release could produce a higher spin rate than a low velocity, sidearm pitcher who can generate spin well.
To control for this, we created Spin+, which attempts to predict a player’s spin rate, using MLB Statcast data, based on both spin axis and velocity. This allows us to isolate only the rotations per minute generated from factors outside of velocity and axis.
Spin+ is useful because we can compare the spin rates of pitchers like Andrew Triggs—who had an average spin rate in 2018 of 2,414 rpm with just an 89 mph fastball and a completely vertical spin axis (in x-z direction) of 269 degrees—with Carl Edwards Jr.—who throws a 94.5 mph fastball that averages 2,658 rpm and an almost completely horizontal axis of 173 degrees.
Although Edwards Jr. boasted the second highest fastball spin rate of any pitcher in the big leagues in 2018 with at least 75 fastballs thrown, Spin+ believes Triggs’ ability to spin the baseball is actually ~90 rpm higher than Edwards Jr.’s, once you control for the advantage that Edwards Jr. has with regards to velocity and axis.
The main takeaway is that raw spin rate can be deceiving without additional context—particularly in physically maturing pitchers where velocity may jump periodically, and spin axis may be more volatile. In designing a pitch, it is important consider how an athlete’s spin rate might change based on the adjustments you’re trying to make. Therefore, it’s important to not only monitor the raw spin rate but the axis as well. Video can also be helpful in this case to get a better idea of how the ball is coming off the fingers.
Additionally, we can also apply the Spin+ methodology to spin efficiency, which like raw spin also shares a relationship with spin axis and velocity. In combining both internal measurements of Spin+ and spin efficiency, we’re able to gain a much better understanding of where a pitcher has the potential to improve based on his underlying data.
To highlight an example using Statcast data in the illustration below, we see the top ten fastballs in 2018 that scored highest in our “pitch potential” metric. This metric is designed to identify fastballs in the big leagues with the greatest potential to increase total movement based on a pitcher’s inherent spin characteristics. By having a pitcher’s predicted and actual spin rate alongside his predicted and actual spin efficiency percentage, we’re able to compare what we’d expect his transverse spin rate should be compared to what actually occurs.
For example, in looking at the 2018 leaderboard above, we see that Tyson Ross threw his two-seamer (FT) with an additional 347 RPMs of raw spin compared to what we would predict given the velo and axis on the pitch. With this information, we can then calculate a Spin Efficiency percentage, which expects that Ross would generate ~2,190 rpm of transverse spin on his two-seamer during the 2018 season.
However, in looking at his output for the 2018 season, we see that Ross came up about 291 rpm short of that figure and only 14 rpm higher than what we would expect an average pitcher with an average spin rate would produce at his axis and velo. This means that Ross is essentially throwing his two-seamer (and four-seamer [FF]) with just league-average movement, despite being amongst the league leaders in generating spin.
Now, in spite of leaving movement on the table, this does not necessarily mean that Ross, or any other pitcher on the list above, has a “poor” design on their fastball. Rather, as you may have noticed, most of these pitchers are sinkerballers by trade, and any increase in transverse spin would impart more “carry” onto their fastballs. By killing movement via gyro spin, they are essentially making their sinkers or two-seamers “heavier,” which almost certainly better plays to their approach of how to get batters out.
This highlights a more parsimonious relationship between spin rate, spin efficiency, and the “right” approach to designing a fastball. There really is no a + b = c magic formula where player x needs to throw a fastball with a specific axis and efficiency percentage to have more success. Rather, we need to consider the constraints of the individual alongside a proper game plan to formulate something that will work best for an athlete’s specific skill set.
As you can see, there is a lot of depth to the discussion around spin rate. The rate that a pitch spins matters, as does the axis. But the axis can change depending on arm slot and the orientation of the hand and fingers at ball release. Beyond even that, you can get even more granular when looking into MLB spin-rate data.
Your head might be spinning from the more complicated sections at the end, but there are a few key points for coaches and players.
Lastly, we need to take a data-driven approach when asking a player to make a specific adjustment on how to throw a pitch. This assures both the coach and athlete that the time and effort spent making said adjustments do not go to waste.
This takes some getting use to, but recognizing what pitches have the potential to be good or bad is the first step in using technology. Ultimately, knowing whether a pitch is ‘good’ depends not only on the spin, axis, and movement profile of the pitch, but also how it performs in game.
As a result, being able to utilize technology to objectively assess a given pitch within the context of relevant metrics is vital to get the most out of a player’s given abilities.

Great article… love the conclusion and those four bullet points, but wanted to ask how strong the relationship was between Spin Rate and Velo/Spin Axis? in my limited experience, those would not have much predictive power to Spin.
did you really delete my earlier comment? I think it’s a reasonable question to ask what kind of relationship you found from Spin Rate to Spin Axis and Velo. you lose credibility when you’re not willing to share the data and models that go into your assumptions and conclusions. Disappointing to see the deleted comment b/c generally you guys consider yourself very “data driven”
whoops… did not see that my previous comment was still awaiting moderation. it did not appear when I revisited the blog post. apologies.
hi, this is an awesome article. kind of a dumb question, but Is there a way i can access this data myself and make my own spreadsheet, similar to the ones showed in here? or is some of it proprietary data not publically available? thanks
Hey there. You should be able to find all of this data publicly available at:
https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/
https://www.brooksbaseball.net/
This is fascinating data-based insight. I have been using pitchLogic for a while now and have found it very helpful for understanding what is happening with my spin axis and spin rates. What surprised me the most was how much of my spin action was around the riflespin axis.

How Do We Generate Spin? - Driveline Baseball,2019-01-24T03:25:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/01/how-do-we-generate-spin/,"With increasing accessibility to tools such as Rapsodo, Trackman, and Flightscope at all levels of the game, spin rate and spin axis have largely dominated much of the recent conversation revolving around pitch design and repertoire development. This greater emphasis should come as no surprise given the relatively strong initial links between spin rate and descriptive measures of performance.
However, despite the large amounts of energy and attention being invested into looking at spin rate by coaches and athletes alike, many questions still linger in the public realm regarding the most fundamental aspects of spin rate.
Given that we now have four full years of Statcast data and a handful of recently published papers to analyze, we can start tackling some of the most basic questions about generating spin that were left unanswered just a few years ago.
Dating to as far back as Stevenson (1985), researchers have been interested in examining finger kinematics and kinetics during the release sequence of overhand throws. Most recently, a paper by Kinoshita et al. (2017) found that pitchers impart three “peaks” of force on the baseball during the delivery corresponding with max external rotation, the ball-rolling phase, and what we’ll describe as spin creation.
Essentially, as the arm accelerates, the ball produces more force on the fingers, which if unmatched, would likely cause the ball to fling backwards at any point during the delivery (Matsuo et al., 2017). Since we do not want this to occur, we subconsciously balance this force with our fingers by imparting a normal force on the ball in the opposite direction (Hore and Watts, 2011).
As we get to the end of this process, the thumb slips off the baseball roughly 6-10ms before release (Matsuo et al., 2017), allowing the ball to roll up our fingertips so that we can accelerate the ball towards the target and impart “shear force” (or tangential force) on the baseball about 3-5ms before release. It is hypothesized that this production of tangential force on the baseball just before release is both how and when spin is generated (Kinoshita et al., 2017).
Picture from Matsuo et al
It might surprise you to learn that there are actually a few straightforward ways to increase your spin rate.
As mentioned on this blog, velocity is linearly related to spin rate from an individual perspective, so increasing your velocity is a surefire way to increase spin.
However, the reasons as to why spin and velocity are correlated in such a manner are a bit less clear. According to Kanosue et al. (2014), “the angle at which the fingertips reached forward over the ball during the top-spin phase (arm acceleration) was highly correlated with ball spin.” The researchers speculate that because higher-velocity pitches need to have a lower vertical release angle to reach home plate as a strike (all else equal), the palm of the throwing hand would have to be angled farther downward at release, thus causing the fingertips to flex farther over the ball. Indeed, when we plot vertical release angle by spin rate once controlling for a pitcher’s individual average using 2018 MLB data, we do see some evidence of this effect.
Alternatively, since shear force was found to closely mirror resultant forces (the forces imparted on the ball to keep it in our hands), it could also be the case that as velocity increases, so too does the force of the baseball on the pitcher’s fingers. As a result, forces generated by the pitcher’s fingers are also magnified, thus increasing the ability of the pitcher to impart greater shear force before release. An illustration of this hypothesis is shown below.
In all likelihood, both of these theories have validity in explaining the link between velocity and spin rate and are at least somewhat interrelated with one another.
Beyond simply increasing velocity, we can also impart more relative cut on the baseball to increase our spin rate. This holds true not only for fastballs, but also across most pitch types as well.
The reasons as to why this occurs are a bit unknown given that forearm and wrist kinematics are difficult to measure and have often been overlooked in biomechanical research. We do know that pitch types with increased amounts of cut, such as curveballs, generally have greater supination of the forearm, ulnar deviation, and wrist flexion when compared to pitches with natural run or fade (Solomito et al., 2014). Perhaps one, two, or all three of these traits can explain why more cut equates to more spin, but more research is necessary to identify potential root causes.
If generating shear force is likely the main producer of spin rate, then the role of finger strength in generating shear force (particularly of the index and middle finger) should not be overlooked. Within the Kinoshita study, it was found that pitchers impart finger forces on the ball close to their strength limit (>80%) while pitching at max intent. From a perspective of purely force production, one could reasonably make the connection that increasing finger strength could have the potential to help an athlete generate more shear force on the baseball.
Despite this fairly straightforward link, to our knowledge there has been only one study which has investigated finger strength and release spin (Woods, Spaniol, & Bonnette 2018). Perhaps counterintuitively, the authors found a negative correlation with spin and finger strength, which can likely be attributed to the fact that grip and intent did not seem to be controlled for and that pitchers were asked to throw curveballs rather than fastballs.
More work is needed to investigate the correlation between spin rate and finger strength, which is a subject we look forward to researching in greater detail moving forward.
Given that we know pitchers have only a handful of milliseconds to impart shear force on the baseball, any additional adhesive properties or friction between the fingers and the ball is likely going to be valuable in helping generate spin (Kinoshita et al., 2017).
But achieving maximum levels friction and adhesion ultimately depend on anatomical and biological factors that are typically outside of an athlete’s control (Spinner, Wiechert, & Gorb, 2016). Attributes such as finger length, age, and sex (though not fingerprints) ultimately become key components in being able to impart spin on a baseball. As a result, it is easy to see why there is a common belief that all pitchers have their own inherent spin rate that is difficult to alter.
Complicating matters further, friction is also impacted by skin hydration levels, which are ever changing and often a function of the surrounding environment (Adams et al., 2013). For example, as air becomes drier, pitchers intuitively know to blow on their hands to apply moisture. Vice versa, as moisture is in the air and athletes begin to sweat, they know to apply rosin to minimize moisture.
It has been found that all athletes have their own optimal moisture level on their fingers to maximize their friction coefficient, meaning that there is no “one size fits all” formula with foreign substances to impart more spin (Adams, Briscoe, & Johnson, 2007). Instead, pitchers should find the right combination of legal substances available to them at any given time to obtain the ideal moisture levels to feel comfortable and impart spin on the baseball.
Besides taking something off a pitch, it is widely known that using a grip that either splits your index and middle fingers or that incorporates your ring finger likely helps decrease your spin rate, even when controlling for velocity. This is something that we have tested in the past, finding that both a split finger grip and three-finger grip decreased Units when compared to more traditional fastball grips.
While the splitfinger effect is a bit easier to understand (try applying force to the palm of your opposite hand using both a regular and splitfinger grip), the three-finger finding is perhaps a little more peculiar given that more fingers should equate to more friction, and thus more spin.
Fortunately, we can look back to the individual forces produced by each finger during arm acceleration provided within the Kinoshita paper to understand why using the ring finger mitigates spin.
Looking at the illustration below, we find that the ring finger, when measured against the index finger, middle finger, and thumb, imparts about half as much shear force onto the baseball, on average, compared to the index and middle finger. The ring finger also has no “peak” of shear force just before ball release, which has been hypothesized as the main link in generating spin.
So, in both cases, it seems as though each grip constrains our ability to impart absolute shear force on the ball in a unique way, thus limiting our ability to impart spin while holding intent levels equal. This lends credence to the idea that there is no grip that works best for everybody, as each pitcher will have different measures of finger strengths, finger lengths, and frictional forces that interact with the ball in a specific way.
Although we now know more about generating spin than we did a few years prior, there is a decent amount of work still needed to be done if we want to fully understand spin and how to develop it. Moving forward, investigating interactions between friction, finger strength, and grips and how they relate to changing spin should provide us with a better understanding of how we can improve the pitching quality of individual athletes.
The future is bright for pitch design, and it seems like we’re only scratching the surface.

IMO, tangential force is the greatest component of creating spin rate. It is very normal for higher spin rates to have less speed when throwing movement pitches other than a fastball. The more tangentially the energy is applied the greater the spin rate but it lessens the energy directed into the ball….thus, less speed.
Certainly a plausible theory- We checked this out using Statcast Data and found a slight positive correlation with breaking balls and velocity once we controlled for a pitcher’s average velocity and spin rate. Essentially, if a big leaguer threw a breaking ball 1 MPH harder than their seasonal average, they imparted an additional 20 RPMs, on average. This doesn’t mean that tangential force isn’t the greatest component for creating spin; rather, the tangential force and total force applied to the baseball likely have a positive correlation between one another regardless of grip type as opposed to a trade-off.

Laminar Express: Using Baseball Science to Enhance Two-Seam Fastballs - Driveline Baseball,2019-01-21T03:13:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/01/laminar-express-baseball-science-behind-the-two-seam-fastball/,"A “laminar express” pitch is a two-seam fastball whose term was coined by Trevor Bauer years ago when he developed a pitch that had dramatically more movement to the arm side than he previously would have had. It was the opinion of coaches at Driveline Baseball that this was happening due to the laminar/turbulent effect on a baseball, as first discussed in regarding baseball by Dr. Alan Nathan on The Hardball Times (images are unfortunately broken on this older post) in 2012, with the underlying science discovered by Dr. Rod Cross and demonstrated in this Veritasium video.
Dr. Nathan was able to derive coefficients for the components of movement with regard to acceleration when the boundary layer of air is asymmetrical:
From that, I can use the experimental relationship between the rotation rate and the Magnus force to estimate the magnitude of the latter. Since the movement is determined from the components of acceleration, and since the Magnus contribution can be estimated, the additional acceleration due to the roughness asymmetry can also be estimated.
Here is what I find for the forces, all normalized to the weight of the ball:
gravity = 1.00
drag = 0.78
Magnus = 0.32
roughness = 0.63
Boundary layer asymmetry – laminar/turbulent airflow – was responsible for quite a high percentage of acceleration change per Dr. Nathan’s calculations, which was tremendously interesting!
The science behind such movement of a baseball was exciting to analyze and actually deploy in a game situation, which Trevor was able to do after months of practice. Eric Jagers demonstrated clear evidence that two pitches that had dramatically different movement on high-fidelity high-speed video from our Edgertronic cameras could read vastly differently on a launch monitor device like Rapsodo, with the numbers being dramatically different and outside the tolerances for margin of error – driving up the statistically likelihood of the effect existing.
Eric’s trial below features a chart of two fastballs thrown with nearly identical vertical and horizontal break as measured by Rapsodo. The launch monitor detects the ball’s spin rate, spin direction, and velocity and recalculates trajectory based on a physics model – hence why it thinks both pitches shown in the video have nearly identical movement when in reality they are quite different.
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/laminar-vs-regular.mp4
You could chalk the “misread” up to an error on Rapsodo, but this is extremely uncommon on clean takes with the Rapsodo launch monitor, and when errors do occur, they almost always report missing data or seriously incorrect reads.
In December 2018, Dr. Barton Smith from Utah State University wrote about how a “laminar express” pitch might work.
The idea of a “Laminar Express” is to cause the flow on one side of the ball to be laminar, and thus have an early separation from the ball surface, while the other side is turbulent and has a later separation. The difference in these separations would cause a lateral force on the ball.
I’ve sketched the situation below. The pitch requires a 2-seam orientation, which produces large areas of smooth surface on the two sides of the ball. As I pointed out in the pressure gradient post, if a seam is near the front of the ball, it will disturb the boundary layer, but it will return to smooth, laminar flow because of the strong, favorable pressure gradient there. This is the case for the seam on the first base side near the front of the ball. The seam on the first base side near the back has no impact, because the boundary layer has already separated there.
Despite all this work and tweetstorms around the effect, it was unclear to many people – including Dr. Nathan himself – if the “laminar” effect was truly happening, and how to measure it.
So, what did we do? We decided to visit Dr. Barton Smith in Logan, Utah ourselves and subject some of our coaches to a grueling trial of throwing hundreds of pitches with the correct laminar orientation through his very specialized and expensive Particle Image Velocimetry machine.
On January 15, 2019, a team from Driveline Baseball including Eric Jagers, Kyle Boddy, Joe Marsh and Dean Jackson visited the USU Experimental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory to attempt to capture the air velocity field around a “Laminar Express” pitch. Dr. Barton Smith, Nazmus Sakib, and Andrew Smith (not pictured) took the measurements.

I won’t reproduce all of Dr. Smith’s work, but I’ll post a sweet image from his PIV analysis as well as his opinion which he tweeted out:
The figure below shows a PIV dataset of one Laminar Express pitch. Note that this is viewed from above. We successfully captured 3 Laminar Express pitches during the day. All three showed an important feature: the wake is tilted upward (to the left from the pitcher’s view). In the dataset below, the boundary layer on top appears laminar, in that it separates from the ball near 12 o’clock. On the other hand, on the other side of the ball, the flow is turbulent, and remains attached to the ball far longer. The net result is a tilted wake. The pattern fits my sketch from a month ago. This ball has a downward force on it (in the data frame of reference) which is to the right from the pitcher’s frame of reference. The PIV data near the ball are poor (and there is a large region of missing data at the bottom of the ball), but this does not affect my conclusions.

It’s a rich tradition of Driveline R&D dating back a decade now to replicate results we already knew were true. Some people would call this “wasting time,” but it’s actually the soul of science to confirm things, not always seek novelty. In this case, we were pretty sure our high-speed video, launch monitor numbers, and anecdotal experience just playing catch indicated that we were right, but science generally demands a higher bar to clear. Dr. Barton Smith’s lab at Utah State allowed us the possibility to delve deeper and see the mechanism by which the “laminar express” really does work, and the results astounded all of us (except for Dr. Barton Smith, who called his shot and was basically correct).
The end result is that we know how to add additional movement not currently tracked or understood by models used by Trackman, Rapsodo, or Flightscope (all for different reasons due to different underlying technologies and assumptions, but that’s a post for another day), and that’s really damn cool. It’s not every day you get to throw baseballs in an expensive materials science laboratory and do hardcore science, finding out things that no one else has discovered, but in January 2019, a bunch of nerds from Driveline Baseball got to do just that.
[…] baseball has their own post on this study which as a lot more of the history. It’s excellent […]

Pitching Assessments and Changing Mechanics - Driveline Baseball,2018-10-31T01:58:42+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/10/pitching-assessments-changing-mechanics/,"Updated 6/16/2022
Over the past few months, we’ve been traveling around the country performing assessments on athletes with our mobile biomechanics lab. The lab is a crucial piece of our assessment process since the summer of 2017. The reason it’s so key to our process is the data it provides and how it combines with our strength assessment. The culmination of this data shows much clearer than ever before how our athletes move and produce force. But what’s more important here is how it provides us with a means of creating actionable changes to an athlete’s mechanics that circumvent some of the frustrations of a traditional approach.
Before we go into how we address mechanical changes, we need to understand the type of data we’re looking at in each piece of the assessment process.
The biomechanics lab is a markered system that measures the kinematics and joint kinetics throughout the throwing motion—or the motion of segments and joints, as well as the underlying forces acting upon those joints. Typically, we look at measurements starting at foot contact, not to be confused with foot plant, since this is only the initial moment when the foot first contacts the ground up until ball release.
We can use this data to provide us with a clearer look at what positions an athlete is achieving at various points within his delivery. This provides a huge advantage over any other means of quantifying movement. For example, if instead we used video to assess an athlete’s movement, not only do we lack a full 360-degree perspective of the movement, but also if we filmed the same throw with slow motion on an iPhone, which films at 240 fps, and an athlete’s arm is rotating at 6,000 deg/sec, we’d lose 25-degrees of motion between each frame. That’s a significant amount of motion that video can’t show.
Even at extremely high frame rates, the arm still blurs, and we lose a lot of understanding of how an athlete is actually moving.
Furthermore, a biomechanics assessment allows us to see things imperceptible to the eye, even on high-quality slow-motion video. For example, you may be able to see that an athlete is generating a decent amount of hip-to-shoulder separation on video, but you can’t see the timing of when the pelvis rotation peaks in comparison to torso rotation. Within the biomechanics data, we are not only able to quantify the degrees of separation but also the crucial timing of when the pelvis and torso reach peak angular velocity.
The ROM assessment in and of itself isn’t groundbreaking. We hand measure each ROM with a goniometer and assess both active and passive ROMs for various movements. Some of this data provides us with potential injury predictors; others provide us with stability or ROM restrictions that may be impacting performance. The main piece here is that it’s not subjective. Each position is measured, which limits the experimenter bias that may happen in less objective ROM assessment processes.
The strength assessment seeks to examine an athlete’s force-velocity profile. We use the tendo unit to determine barbell velocities at three different percentages (30%, 40%, and 50%) of an idealized one-rep max (1RM) for squat, deadlift, and bench press. The 1RM is determined using an allometric score, factoring both the height and weight of an athlete. This data can then give us some insight into how strong, how explosive, and how efficient an athlete is at moving at different weights.
To help provide some context as to what each piece of the assessment looks like, here’s a snippet of data from one of our pro pitchers, who used to sit in the mid 90s but now averages upper 80s.
The photo above is a look at the max hip-to-shoulder separation he generates during his delivery and at the timing of his peak-pelvis rotational velocity to his peak-torso rotational velocity. Ideally, here we want to see him generate a higher degree of hip-to-shoulder separation and have the timing between peak pelvis and torso rotation be at .05s or greater.
From the ROM assessment we see that his thoracic ROM is significantly lower on the left side. Since he’s a left-handed pitcher, it’s common to have a deficit to the throwing side. However, we know he already generates a low amount of hip-to-shoulder separation and because of this we would like to see a higher degree of thoracic rotation.
His strength assessment is significantly below the parameters we look for on all weights, but by examining the spreads between velocities, we see that the gap between them is fairly consistent, though greater than what we typically like to see. This suggests that the athlete is likely weak but explosive in nature since the lightest weight was only .18 off the mark, whereas the heaviest weight was .41 below the desired number.
We no longer perform VBT for our assessments, you can read more on our current assessment process at the bottom of this blog.
Admittedly, we’re not the first to use any one of these pieces to assess athletes. ASMI has had a biomechanics lab since 1987, ROM has been assessed long before the invention of the first goniometer, and, though velocity-based training technology is somewhat new, strength coaches have been using various percentages for decades to assess and train their athletes.
The game changer is how we examine the assessment. Typically, most places provide assessment reports in the form of piece-by-piece data labeling inefficiencies, similar to the above. There are also no prescriptions to correct these inefficiencies, so unless you have a high-level knowledge of movement, mobility, and stability, you really don’t know how to go about enacting change.
What we aim to do at Driveline is to combine each piece into a whole and then attack any deficiencies through an integrated approach. To better provide clarity, let’s discuss all of the data above from our pro pitcher and how they factor together.
So, we know from the biomechanics report that the athlete mentioned above is lacking hip-to-shoulder separation and the timing of this movement is poor. This is likely linked to his lack of thoracic ROM and his inability to rotate to his throwing side, but why can’t he rotate? The last piece of the assessment helps provide an answer: he’s lacking strength. So, for an athlete who once threw in the mid 90s, his hips and torso have to rotate at extremely high velocities. If his strength is poor, especially hip and core, then his body will provide protective tightness so that he doesn’t put damaging levels of stress on his spine.
What you haven’t seen is that his right hip also has a deficit in hip IR, creating a total IR/ER ROM deficit of 14 degrees. The right hip has created protective tightness to prevent itself from working into a ROM it doesn’t feel safe in, the lumbar spine has since become mobile rather than stable, and this has caused him to experience a myriad of lower-back issues over the years. From there, his t-spine has become stable since the lumbar spine is now mobile, the root cause for his significant deficit in hip-to-shoulder separation. Furthermore, this carries all the way up to the shoulder where he has a slight deficit in left-shoulder IR causing a total IR/ER ROM deficit in the throwing shoulder that is similar in nature to the right hip.
In order to get him back to throwing mid 90s, we first and foremost need to restore ROM and strength to the hips and core.
You may be reading this and say, “Well I’ve done parts of this. My trainers collect ROM data, I use video, my strength coaches improve strength. We’re doing all of these things even though we don’t sit down and discuss it together. Does that matter?” Or maybe you only do some of these things, but not all, so how does that impact the way you program and coach?
Let’s take a look at the same pro athlete’s data and consider how if you only look at one piece of the assessment, then you may wind up spinning your wheels and not developing your athlete at all, or worst case, decreasing his performance. For example, say you only look at the biomechanics data and see his deficit in hip-to-shoulder separation. We know we need to improve this, so you program roll-in drills to help him get into a position where his torso is closed while the pelvis opens into foot contact. However, he’s physically incapable of getting into that position, and repeatedly doing it and failing overtime will result in both he and you growing frustrated. You might think he’s lazy and he loses buy in with what you’re trying to get him to do.
This kind of scenario happens all the time in a variety of ways. We’ve seen it with athletes from a ROM aspect as well. The same athlete could come in and get assessed and find out he has a deficit in thoracic rotation. His coach programs a bunch of mobility drills around t-spine mobility, but the athlete is hypermobile and lacks stability. He does the drills religiously, but he winds up having worse rotation than at the beginning. Often the coach goes on to blame the athlete—saying he didn’t do the work, he was lazy with his reps—and meanwhile the athlete’s getting worse because his body craves stability and all you’re doing is adding more ROM.
Lastly, imagine you only look at his strength data. Sure, you know he’s weak and you know he has to get stronger, but what you may not see is the deficit in hip mobility. You may spend the next few training blocks hammering out bilateral strength, but if you’re not addressing his frontal plane and core stability, you may not help him restore his ROM. You’ve helped him gain a bunch of strength, but he may not be able to effectively apply that force and transfer it because his movement quality is still poor.
We’ve addressed part of this already, but to take this full circle, let’s discuss how we can use the assessment data to make changes to an athlete’s mechanics.
If you follow Driveline, you likely have an idea of how we use backwards chaining, over- and under-load weighted baseballs, Plyo Ball ®, and high-intensity training to alter mechanics. It’s a huge piece of our success and one that we’re constantly refining. One of the ways we’re doing this currently is using our biomechanics report to adjust programming by altering what Plyo Ball ® are thrown, what drills we use, how many reps are performed, as well as other things to influence mechanical changes.
This is something the baseball world has roughly been doing forever: seeing mechanical flaws and using drills to try and correct for them. With the biomechanics report, we just have a much more targeted approach.
However, where the real magic happens is what we can do on the strength side to drive mechanical changes. As mentioned previously, a lot of the time you’re putting athletes in drills or coaching positions they’re actually incapable of getting into. Using the biomechanics, strength, and ROM assessments, we can structure soft-tissue work and a warm-up around an athlete’s deficiencies by working to open up ROM, strengthen through the newly obtained ROM, and then priming for the rest of the workout.
As for the actual lifts, consider this excellent quote by Vern Gambetta: “We want to train movements, not muscles.” Sure, we want to get guys stronger, but we have to target the movements we do poorly and strengthen the ones we do well. This is what helps drive mechanical changes.
For example, we’re big believers in using med balls once we’re confident an athlete’s hip and core strength is ready for it. Med balls work well because they’re a power exercise, but not so light that they create a large amount of fatigue, which provides us with a great way to get extra repetitions of the movements we want to change when we can’t throw more baseballs.
The key here is that we’re not giving the athletes answers; we’re not telling them how to move or breaking everything down into a specific movement. That’s not an efficient way to learn. Instead, we help athletes achieve the adequate strength and ROM to move more efficiently through weight-room work and then use high-intent weighted-ball training with external cueing as the bread crumbs to allow athletes to self discover how to move optimally for themselves.
What we really want you to take away from this post is the importance of a full in-depth assessment for improving player development. You may not have the ability to perform each of these pieces the way we do at Driveline, but if you aren’t integrating these pieces to really take an in-depth look at your athletes, then you’re missing out on huge opportunities to make strides in their performance.
However, this is all useless if you still go about trying to change mechanics solely through internal cueing or drill work. You need more than that. Changing ingrained movement patterns is difficult, especially when a large amount of how athletes move is purely a result of their strength and ROM. Start thinking about different ways to create movement change. Don’t break the movements down into unnecessary pieces, but start assessing them and then structuring programs around what the athletes’ deficiencies are. If you’re putting them in constraint drills that force them to correct their deficiencies in order to throw harder, you’ll start finding that athletes will often begin moving better on their own as they begin to gain the strength and ROM to do so.

Starting in 2020, we revamped our strength assessment. Due to certain limitations in the tendo and similar units, we elected to begin using force plates. An overview of the testing battery can be found here. We use a range of tests to find the athlete’s Maximal Strength, Explosive Strength, and Reactive Strength.
Limitations using bar speed include standardization, accuracy of the technology, and skill involved in the lifts themselves. The aim was to minimize these limits and create a more robust dataset with our athletes. The new battery of tests has done this to a high degree and allowed us to continue to improve athlete results while creating some very interesting models, such as predicted velocity.
Great article. I will use this while rehabbing my pitchers. Most of the time they want to start “changing their mechanics” when they start rehab. I have to convince them to get mobile, stable and strong first. Thanks.

Comparing Coaching Philosophies - Driveline Baseball,2018-07-17T23:24:48+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/07/comparing-coaching-philosophies/,"Our methods for teaching hitting and pitching differ from most. While there are many different styles of coaching, even those who have seen or worked with such variety find that our methods stand out in a number of ways.
We’ve previously discussed various reasons for why we use weighted balls and wrist weights, as well as why we use weighted bats and constraints in hitting.
However, we have not spent much time discussing the underlying philosophical reasons for our methods.
To best, and briefly, show how our coaching is different, let’s break down a comparison by looking at a more common method of coaching compared to some of the philosophies and theories that drove us to think of training in a different way.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
Broadly speaking, let’s consider a developmental model of how many coaches in baseball think about teaching hitting and pitching. Although many of them probably don’t mention a specific philosophy, we can see some themes.
Often, coaches select a hitter or pitcher that they personally believe to be an ideal hitter or pitcher. This is usually a very popular and successful professional baseball player.
After this, they first attempt to figure out what pieces of that player’s mechanics are the keys to his or her success. This usually comes from picking up what players say in interviews about their thought processes on training. Second, coaches often analyze mechanics using pictures or videos, which has become increasingly popular. From this, coaches will choose the “big idea” pieces or movements of what they wish to focus training on.
Train at Driveline
Lastly, coaches make up drills to funnel their players towards what they believe the “correct” movements to be. This usually comes to form by matching specific positions in the swing or when pitching—for example, “every pitcher has a good balance point” or “points the ball to second base” or “each hitter gets their foot down early.”
Those drills are then repeated until a sort of mechanical perfection is reached. Players’ performance in a game is looped back to practice, where the mechanical pieces that players need to improve are practiced.
This approach is supported by a belief that players have good mechanics when they do well and bad mechanics when they don’t. So, this means that because performance is a mechanical problem, it can be fixed by rote repetition.
Coaches who implement this approach mainly work around the idea of an athletic or a baseball-skill funnel. They see what the best players do, and they take their players from where they are to what the coaches believe is best to do.
On the occasion that they don’t have one idea athlete to model, there is the belief that “all great pitchers/hitters do X or Y.” This can continue to have as many steps as the funnel, as the coaches believes there are absolutes in hitting or pitching.
The last piece of this “mystery baseball coach philosophy” is that they try to get their players to replicate the ideal model by drills and verbal cues, generally with a heavy emphasis on internal cues and feel.
Now, we understand that feel is very important to many athletes. Many successful athletes keep routines not only because they prepare them, but also because they have a more consistent feel each time they perform.
But that can also result in an issue: feel can change day by day. Take a second to imagine what a great batting practice session or a great bullpen felt like. Now, compare that feeling to a day you practice after little sleep or when you were sore from lifting.
While the task did not change between those events, the feel did.
This coaching model is probably the most common. Unfortunately, there are a few flaws with how it scales with a large number of athletes. Mainly, it can dismiss certain strengths that athletes have in an attempt to box them into certain movements.
Good theories are not improved by piling up more evidence in support. However, seeing what evidence does and does not support the theory boxes it in and gives better perspective. This makes it so that the theories either become more accurate or needs to be dismissed.
The problem with the coaching model we mentioned above is that coaches almost always solely focus on narrowing down support, rather than looking for exceptions or evidence to the contrary. This leaves holes in any analysis.
All coaching philosophies that are based on the replication of one athlete’s movements have series flaws.
While this doesn’t dismiss the fact that high-level players likely share similar principles, they are most likely much more broad than what’s currently discussed. Plus, trying to narrow down movements to very specific checklists leaves little room for variability.
Now that we’ve discussed one of those common approaches, this is where we can take something from dynamic systems theory (DST).
If we quickly take a big picture look, dynamical systems perspective says that human movement consists of a highly intricate network of co-dependent sub-systems (e.g. respiratory, circulatory, nervous, skeletomuscular, perceptual) composed of many interactive parts (e.g. blood cells, oxygen molecules, muscle).
Whew, that’s a lot to take in. Let’s try another way to think of this definition: everything matters, and everything is a piece of the puzzle of athlete performance.
Performance isn’t a top down mechanical only ‘problem’ but something that have multiple variables to attend too.
To us, this can be first reframed in simpler terms as a comparison to the older school coaching model. We should acknowledgement that both problems keeping athletes from improving and solutions helping athletes to improve can come from many different areas.
DST isn’t cut and dry, but it offers a framework where multiple variables can affect a player.
There isn’t one mechanical model to box athletes into. There are multiple ways that coaches can go about improving an athlete’s movement besides directly coaching it.
The human body is a complex system with different aspects interwoven with one another.
This means that when trying to improve an athlete’s performance, the discussion shouldn’t focus only on mechanics; it should also focus on how mechanics play a role intertwined with mobility, strength, and other factors.
This differs from the older coaching model mentioned above, where athletic improvement comes from mechanical fixes and poor performance also comes from mechanical issues.
Now, for the sake of comparison, we can simplify things a little. Let’s consider three scenarios where we can take a multivariable approach to improving an athlete’s performance. For this, let’s simplify the variables to mechanics, strength, mobility and psych.
Note: The changes in the graphic do not represent changing importance or intent in each variable but the focus of each may change to meet a goal. These adjustments in programming are also made with workload management in mind.
This is where we can see how we are moving beyond a mechanics solution by looking at many factors and trying to address them accordingly.
We should also say that there is significantly more to cover on dynamical systems theory in many areas, but for an introduction of how it may relate to baseball, this should remain simple. We need to start looking at multiple causes and solutions rather than seeing everything through a mechanical lens.
We admit that trying to move to a system that considers more variables for improving player performance can be daunting.
It can take a lot of time to learn a lot about one domain, so it’s natural to feel overwhelmed by the need to know a lot about multiple domains. However, it mostly takes time, effort, and desire to learn.
This is also where we can do better at breaking down silos among different groups in order to better work together: coaches, strength coaches, physical therapists, etc. We’ve mentioned before that good team communication is vital to success. We see our throwing trainers, strength trainers, and physical therapists discussing issues on players every day.
So, while it would certainly help to be knowledgeable about all these topics, in the meantime we can encourage more collaboration between people of different backgrounds to work with players.
This is why we closely integrate hitting and pitching movement, strength, and mobility, among others. They all have a stake in a player’s success and should be on the same page of what an athlete’s strengths and needs are to see where he needs to grow.
Interested in training with us? Both in-gym and remote options are available!
I definitely do not believe “old school” philosophy dismissed other important factors in performance.  Mechanics is probably the least important factor for professional athletes… however, for amateurs/ and aspiring professionals it is the foundation from which you build strength, mobility, timing, and mental aptitude. No one seriously believes the two box model you are describing above… love your stuff but your differentiation pitch has to be more credible.
Thanks for reading. We would disagree with your statement that “Mechanics…is the foundation from which you build strength, mobility…”. In our eyes the opposite is true.
Building strength in the weight room and working on targeted mobility feeds into pitching mechanics. Working on mechanics alone doesn’t measurable change strength and mobility in the same way.
Lastly, the comparison was purposefully broad in both the mechanics and multi-variable model to make a point. The point being movement (pitching mechanics) needs to be integrated with strength & mobility as well as other factors.

Player Development: Integration and Communication for Better Results - Driveline Baseball,2018-04-13T00:49:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/04/player-development-integration-communication-better-results/,"Player development is the holy grail of baseball. Velocity, movement, command, injury prevention: the teams that can develop these traits better and faster than others are the ones that will be, theoretically, hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy more often than any others. This doesn’t just play at the major-league level either. In fact, it’s almost more important at the college and high school levels where you can’t just shovel out huge salaries or make a trade to get the pieces you need. At the high school level, you can’t even recruit; you get whoever lands in your school district. This is why player development is so crucial to the success of an organization or team. This is why teams should invest big sums to further their players’ development.
However, that’s not what’s happening for the majority of baseball teams, especially at the affiliated level. This is a problem, because players have particular expectations. Like many others, I believed that if I was good enough to make it to the next level, to play college ball, to just get on an affiliate roster, there would be a coach there who would help me become a better baseball pitcher—because I knew I had more in the tank. Does this sound familiar?
The higher level you get to, the better coaching you believe you must receive. But that’s unfortunately not always the case, which brings us to this quote from a current minor leaguer:
“There is no player development. Teams aren’t adding velocity or any of that, the teams that appear the best at player development are the teams that are the best at not screwing their talent up.”
So, is that what good player development is? Is it just, not getting in the way? Or should it be something more?
First, we need to acknowledge that player development in-season is very difficult. While improvements can be made, development isn’t a primary focus when trying to compete and win baseball games.
Second, it comes down to the offseason—when high school and college players may be playing other sports or working around rules of contact hours, and minor leaguers are looking for another job to make ends meet.
Finally, you get into what players are doing in the off-season. You wonder if everyone is on the same page, especially when when almost thirty percent of all injuries needing surgery occur during spring training (Lindbergh, 2015).
So, if the current model isn’t ideally servicing our athletes, how do we change it? Now, I am by no means privy to all the details of player development in affiliated baseball nor am I aware of what every college and high school is doing around the country. I also realize that every player has their own unique situation and circumstances. However, since I have spent time around major and minor league clubs and coached college baseball for five years, I want to share what I see as some of the biggest issues currently facing true player development.
Any sort of self-help or leadership book almost always talks about communication. Communication as a whole is incredibly important—just ask your significant other; relationships don’t work without communication. However, often and at almost every level, we see a dearth of communication among the skill coaches, strength coaches, and the ATCs. (We won’t even begin to bring the R&D folks into this to keep it simple.) While this is not always the case, more often than not each group is siloed into their own realms and relegated to certain tasks: get them healthy, get them strong, make them throw strikes, etc. These shouldn’t be individual tasks; each group can have a positive impact in a cohesive manner.
This is where, when you really get rolling, true player development begins.
For example, consider a pitcher who’s struggling to throw strikes. The pitching coach works with him, maybe tries some mechanical changes, some drills, but however he chooses to correct it, the player either gets better or he doesn’t. The important part here is that the athlete’s skill development often begins and ends with only the pitching coach. Now, imagine instead the pitching coach takes a look at the struggling pitcher, realizes he has some mechanical inefficiencies with his lead leg, sees there’s a lot of lateral shifting, and knows that it doesn’t seem to brace well. The pitching coach then programs certain drills to improve lead-leg brace and then informs the strength coach and ATC about it as well.
The ATC does an assessment, learns the athlete is lacking internal hip rotation, so no matter how much the pitching coach does, he would have never helped that athlete to block his lead leg and improve his command. However, knowing this, now the ATC begins working to manually increase hip IR, and the strength coach programs mobility and strength work to help strengthen the hip through its newly opened range of motion. The skill coach can continue to help the athlete pattern that movement, while being cognizant of the athlete’s limitations and how he’s progressing his development.
The idea behind this process started when Kyle Boddy and Jack Scheideman took a trip to Altis, where they watched Stuart McMillin, Dan Pfaff, and others provide manual therapy while observing their sprinters’ warm-ups. They used manual therapy to adjust and correct for any movement restrictions they noticed in their athletes. The athletes, knowing their bodies and their “feel” better than anyone else also provided feedback so that the trainers could correctly treat and fine tune the athletes for that day’s workout. Through this simple communication loop, they began to not only bridge the athletes’ development gaps, but also improve their performance, allowing them to be more prepared for that day’s training or competition.
I should also point out that we know this scenario isn’t available for everyone, but it’s important for school coaches to reach out to their ATC and for facility owners to start networking local PTs, ATC, and chiropractors to refer athletes to. The goal is not to have athletes become dependent on treatment, but to provide a means of identifying limitations, treating them, and then putting athletes on a sustainable path that will allow them to be self sufficient through warm-ups and training.
My question then, is, Why are we not doing this with at least bullpen pitchers in baseball? If sabermetrics is telling us that the highest-leverage innings come later in the game, why do we not want these athletes as finely tuned for performance as possible? They often warm up for four hours before the start of the game. Four hours!
Now, that’s not four hours before they pitch; that’s four hours before first pitch. So, tack on another one and a half to two or more hours from there, and you can’t tell me that after getting hot six hours ago things haven’t stiffened back up. Just think about how you feel after sitting behind a desk for a few hours—great right? I doubt it.
So why would you not have a manual therapist working on helping pitchers feel better and become more finely tuned an inning or two ahead of their potential appearances?
While this falls under communication, making an effort to learn terminology and gain knowledge in departments outside of your own not only helps make you a better coach or trainer, but also facilitates ease of communication among groups. For example, if you understand the strength and conditioning concepts of energy systems and training economy, as a pitching coach it can help you better structure practices and coordinate with the strength coach on lifting, recovery, overreaching, and other important training factors required for player development. The same goes for the strength coach, who likely has a good understanding of the movements required for success in the sport but can benefit from understanding the movement and mechanical principles the skill coach is looking to have his athletes perform.
There are other examples of how important it is to know your training staff’s philosophies, what they’re doing to train athletes, and the terminology they use when speaking to athletes in order to make you and your athletes better, so we won’t wear this out. Just remember, the more you know about every aspect of your athletes’ training, the better you will communicate and the better you will be at training them yourself.
This is something I’ve been guilty of and that I’ve seen many smart coaches struggle with as well: it’s ok to share knowledge. It’s ok to let people into your world and to tear down that silo. All too often we feel the need to protect our knowledge. We live and work in a competitive industry and sometimes knowing more than everyone else seems like job security. You’re valued more if you know more, right? As wrong as this is, I’m sure we’ve all worked with others who have had this kind of attitude. Some of them even try to brow beat you over the head with their knowledge.
One major league strength coach I spoke with said he worked with a pitching coach early in his career who used his knowledge of biomechanics to throw other members of his staff under the bus when things went south for his pitchers. That kind of thought process doesn’t contribute to athletic development and success no matter how much you know. Not sharing information and not learning more of what your coworkers’ departments are doing limits you and your team’s ability to impact athletes positively. It also sets up a poisonous work environment. Regardless of how much that coach knew about biomechanics, you can’t tell me he was going to have long-term success. It’s just not possible with that mindset.
This is the last piece of player development we’ll touch on, so let’s set the record straight right away: Feel is not real, and technology is not the answer. You can hate sabermetrics; you can hate Rapsodo and edgertronic cameras. You can believe launch angles are the devil and deny batted-ball exit velocity.
However, the truth is you need these if you want to give your athletes the best opportunities to develop, but remember that these tools are not the answers in and of themselves. They’re simply a means of measuring improvement and providing feedback for quality control. You won’t believe how many athletes think they’re throwing a curveball only to discover on the Rapsodo that they’re actually throwing a 30% spin efficiency crappy cutter. While it may even look moderately ok to the eye, for some reason it keeps getting tattooed for doubles in the gap. Like it or not, the technology is there to help understand the why of what is happening.
But as I said, technology alone is not the answer, it needs a good coach to be able to interpret the data and communicate it to his athletes. You can’t just use the Rapsodo and edgertronic cameras to develop a new pitch if you don’t understand seam orientation, spin axis, spin rate, etc. A good coach provides feedback and suggestions based on an athlete’s feedback (i.e. feel) and data from the technology, and the same goes with hitting and using a Rapsodo or anything else you do. Regardless of the task or environment, there’s a necessity of having a coach there to discuss feel and direction; we just want to use whatever technology it is to help aid that process. It’s not meant to take over the process and it certainly isn’t there to replace a coaching staff. Instead, it should empower them to better own their athletes’ development.
Don’t be afraid of data and technology—baseball is going to the nerds and for good reason. They’re finding ways to analyze the game like never before, and this means more opportunities to understand the game and make your players better. Don’t run from it; embrace it, because players will always need coaches to show them the way and if you’re willing to look, the way forward is starting to have much better signs to guide us.
In closing, I just want to reiterate that for organizations and teams to experience peak player development, there needs to be communication. You can buy all of the technology you want, you can throw weighted balls, you can have the best, most educated coaching staff in the country, but if you’re not fully integrated with every department, if you don’t utilize your strength coaches, skill coaches, and ATCs to best of their abilities, you’re missing huge opportunities to develop your athletes.
We need everyone discussing what they’re seeing and sitting down together to formulate development plans with their athletes. It doesn’t matter if an athlete struggles with exit velocity, command, health, etc, everyone can have an impact on improving each athlete’s development. This is one of the reasons we’ve been so successful at Driveline. The more we’ve integrated all aspects of our floor into one, the better results we’ve seen, and the lower our injury rates have been.
So, let’s breakdown the silos. It’s time for a better age of player development where we don’t just avoid screwing talent up, we take talent and make it great.

I believe that your Research department should implement another aspect of assessment in pitching recovery in the form of MuscleSound. It will help to assist your team in analyzing how muscles recover after throwing and how much fuel or energy the muscles need to achieve optimal muscle size and composition.  Which to me means once the athlete is assessed with the Muscle Sound protocol then that athlete has a baseline fuel level. Then keep track of his fuel level( protein, water levels, nutrition) every 2-3 days and monitor his velo with his muscle recovery and fuel levels. The program is simple to use.  Plus  at driveline you have a steady sample size of pitchers   A university would have the same sample size. Meaning more pitchers or throwers to assess and be able to monitor and get to optimal performance. My hunch is this: if a pitcher is dominating at every start and throwing 95-98 or even. 88-93… but only lasts 4-5 starts then hits a dead period.  Could it be that the Muscle Fuel levels are low and we do not even know? Meaning If we track muscle fuel levels and compare with actual performance is there a correlation.  Could this information help each athlete ? Help each pitcher get better? Help an underdeveloped pitcher get better? I think so. After all what could it hurt? I have a Muscle Sound but really do not have access to constant athletes. Use it more for post op patients and work related injuries. But this seems to be the missing link in recovery and management of velo for pitchers after or during throwing. I have no finanacial interest in Muacle Sound but they are based in Denver Colorado and way to reach. From there I feel like Droveline can set up a protocol very easily with some outstanding conclusions that could change the way PTs., ATC  and MD and pitching organizations look at development. Why not be the pioneer ? Also could be done with hitters and any throwing athletes . The people who implement the MuscleSound can all be trained.  The software for each assessment is easy to read and is cloud based.
Integrating MuscleSound imaging of all athletes (pitchers and hitters) on a regular basis will provide an area of research for Driveline that is missing.  The correlation of muscle health ( fuel and composition) with velocity gains. I have a Muscle Sound imaging decision cue that I use on my patients and a small amount of athletes ( my son is a high school pitcher). So what I want to know is how is fuel levels correlate with his velo and what will his velo be when his fuel levels ( energy ) is full. I have been doing this for 3 weeks and his current fuel stays is low A compared to national norms and to his contrlateral side. So if he is at 29% fuel capacity now and throwing 87-91 as a 17 year old what will he be throwing at full capacity. How long do W.A. or take him to replenish his muscle fuel after he pitches a complete game.   These are all viable questions that can help everyone. I would like to see Driveline start to include this data with their research. It is easy to implement and the learning curve is easy. The tech savvy people who can scan the muscles are needed but a trainer or PT can easily do this. Muscle Sound is in Denver Colorado and easily accessed online for information.
We are open to the idea, but it is cost-prohibitive and the device lacks the open source support we require for our workload tracking integration. If the cost came down and the device/data was opened more, we would strongly consider it.

"Assessments, Data, and Individualization - Driveline Baseball",2018-03-09T03:28:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/03/assessments-data-individualization/,"Individualization is seen as a must have with training programs. While this is good, it doesn’t come without some misunderstandings. We’ve touched on some of those issues before, but it sometimes seems like people get confused by what individualization means in relation to sports.
At times, individualization is treated in the sense that all players have to have a training program that is entirely unique to them, and only them, one that is brand new and never seen before—except that doesn’t always make a lot of sense.
In reality, good individualization shouldn’t be a program that completely starts from scratch, with everything new. Rather, it should be one based on sound principles and then tweaked based on assessment in order to better tailor to the needs of the athlete. This should happen for lifting, throwing, and hitting programs.
Train at Driveline
A simple example comes from a lifting program. Each program should be able to cover the basic movement patterns: squat, hinge, push, and pull. But how each athlete does that is subject to change based on the particular characteristics each athlete has.
Maybe one athlete’s body is more conducive to the front squat than the back squat. Maybe he’s had back issues and bilateral squats (front and back) irritate his spine, but single leg work doesn’t. All of these changes fall under individualization and should come from a quality assessment at the beginning of the training process.
Baseball specifically has a significant amount of data in the game—nearly everything is tracked. This gives players and coaches a unique advantage to assess specific skills and then create programs built upon that information.
There are many misconceptions with the data revolution in baseball, many coaches feel as though the technology is intended to replace them, which isn’t true. There will be no winner between a battle of technology or coaching, but it also isn’t a battle that needs to be fought. The best teams will simply be the ones that integrate technology with coaching.
The worst uses of technology are the ones with no action, which is more common than not, and is probably why many dislike it. Spin rate, exit velocity and launch angle metrics with no ability to understand or know how to develop players off it is a waste. But those who disregard the data as a challenge to their current coaching concepts will be passed over by those who use it to their advantage.
Much of the technology now available gives coaches and players the opportunity to answer questions that people have been unable to answer.
Technology and the data it produces isn’t going to replace coaching. It’s going to fill in the gaps and supplement the knowledge a coach already has.
The best teams and coaches will be a blend of technology and coaching making the player development process more precise. The use of data in a formal and continuous fashion means that we can consistently assess our athletes to individualize programs to help them improve. Below we are going to look at how we can use information from assessments to individualize programming.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
We see assessment as a multi-part process. At our facility we have formal assessments every four weeks. There is a straight mobility check, a look a strength, and a look at either hitting or pitching movement.
Formal assessments serve the purpose of seeing if the pieces of the training program that are inserted to individualize and help an athlete with a skill are working.
This goes beyond watching a player train or play on a day-to-day basis. It’s a time to take a step back and get a look at how all the pieces of a training program are working together.
Many times there are “issues” that coaches see in a player’s hitting or pitching mechanics, and they try to cue them into better habits. This isn’t going to work if the player isn’t moving a certain way because he isn’t mobile enough or stable enough to hold that position.
Too often pitching and hitting are discussed in a vacuum that neglects strength and conditioning or mobility aspects.
This is why the first part of an assessment, for us, covers these measurables: mobility and strength.
We’re looking at range-of-motion and how an athlete moves under load, which gives us an idea of not only movement quality but also strength and power.
This can then be paired with a performance assessment by getting on the mound and watching a player throw, looking at movement quality with video, which does have his limitations, or reviewing biomechanics with either the Motus sleeve or a biomechanics lab—all while collecting velocity, spin rate, and pitch-movement characteristics.
This is where technology and data fit in so well to the assessment process. They are simply more specific measurements of the things that coaches are seeing day in and day out.
Doing all of these things gives us a detailed look at where a player is currently, so we can pinpoint the areas that need to improve. Each player is going to lift, do mobility work, and throw. But collecting this data allow us to take those areas and tweak them specifically to someone’s needs.
This goes beyond watching a pitcher throw and say that they move well enough or they look good. There are now measurables to aim for to keep an athlete healthy and improve their performance on the field.
Throwing programs can take many forms depending on age, skill set, and the season that the pitcher is in. If we focus in on the off-season, we can see the variety of ways programming can go for an athlete. But it’s important to realize that the throwing programs change because of the assessment process, paired with playing, training, and injury history.
What if velocity and strength are low? Probably this means it’s the best time for a lower-volume throwing with more of an emphasis in the weight room in order to build up a strong foundation of strength.
What if velocity is low but strength is high? This is a good time for more velocity-specific throwing work or velocity based training in the weight room.
What if there’s poor movement quality on the mound? Work specifically with Plyo Ball ® to remap your arm action, while working on getting stronger and more mobile in the weight room.
Good velocity but not strong in the weight room? Time to get your strength up to par.
What if they’ve got good velocity and are strong in the weight room? This either means that specific command work is needed or more pitch design work to improve other pitches.
The point is all of these are skills: velocity, command, and strength, which means that they can be improved. That’s why getting accurate measurements to see specifically where pitchers are can be so beneficial.
There is no better example for what technology can do to improve player development than pitch design.
In today’s day and age, there is no reason for a player to enter college or pro ball, be told that what he needs to do to get to the next level is to develop an offspeed pitch and not be able to get immediate feedback while working to improve one.
Every player and coach has spent time working on an offspeed pitch and then waiting days or weeks to see how it does in a game before tweaking a grip or cue again. There is immense value is shortening the time it takes by getting spin rate readings on a device like the Rapsodo and seeing how the ball comes out your hand with an high-speed camera.
Hitting has similar themes to pitching.
If an athlete needs to hit the ball harder, he is going to spend time working on his swing, but he is also going to need to get comfortable in the weight room.
If there are mechanical issues that need to be addressed, look at doing specific mobility work and using weighted bats and other constraint drills.
If an athlete has trouble catching up to high velocities, it’s good to be practicing hitting 92. If there’s trouble with offspeed pitches, practice hitting offspeed pitches.
This is also where measuring exit velocity and launch angle come in. Yes, certain hitters can overhaul their swing to hit the ball harder and at a higher launch angle. But they can also improve both of those metrics by becoming more consistent and getting less mis-hits.
There is a different process when you have a hitter who already hits the ball hard compared to one that needs to hit the ball harder and at a better angle.
It isn’t the technology or data itself that makes that choice, it’s the coach looking at the numbers and communicating with the player what the steps are to get to the next level.
All of these come down to assessment—seeing where an individual is at, then specifically looking at what each needs to improve on in order to get better.
The benefit of having a data-centric approach is that assessments can be continuous.
On top of the formal assessments, the data we collect during training, plus the time watching our athletes, train also works as an assessment.
Velocity days track throwing progress just like HitTrax can track exit velocity and launch-angle progress.
Even though these numbers can be incredibly valuable, there is often push back on how they should be used, or if they should be used at all.
One of the most unusual things about coaches and players not seeing the positives for certain metrics is that many of them simply describe what occurred: exit velocity, launch angle, spin rate, pitch movement, and even pitch velocity are all descriptions of what occurs.
They aren’t a new way of coaching. They just describe what happens. It’s up to the coaches and players to decide the best way to make a change or if change is needed at all.
We now have an unbelievable opportunity to measure what previously couldn’t be measured. So not only do we know what the better players do when they are successful, but we can measure where an individual player is and work on getting him to the next level.
All the data that can be taken in during an assessment, or tracked during training, is simply more information to better supplement good coaching.
Good coaching should be able to take the information of where that player is and help him work towards where he wants to be.
Pitch velocity and spin rate are valuable to a pitcher because they tell us more about how he should pitch. It’s no secret that faster pitches are harder to hit—that’s just math. All a radar gun does is give you a concrete idea of where you are. Getting spin-rate data from a Rapsodo can tell a pitcher how to use his fastball, and it can give much more specific information on how to improve other pitches.
Every hitter wants to get hits, so understanding how hard and where he is hitting the ball is going to be valuable information. Then, understanding what the players better than him are doing is going to give him goals to aim for.
Many of the counter-arguments against these metrics come linked to some sort of hitting or pitching philosophy, which is where the problem comes in. People do not understanding that the numbers have value in their own right, or they misunderstand or misinterpret what they mean.
Coaches can take that data and use it as a goal to work the player towards. How do you get there? Good coaching, that’s how. Coaches are going to need to take the data and do whatever they need to do to get the players to reach those numbers.
Doesn’t matter what cues, doesn’t matter the drills, just get the players from where they are now closer to their goals.
We now know more about professional players now than we did years ago, and that knowledge should be used to help develop players. We aren’t aiming for a certain batting average, because we now know: the best hitters hit the ball more often at X MPH and at Y Launch Angle, so those are the goals we need to reach to be better.
If I’m only going to get a hit three or four times every ten at-bats, then I should train to get as many hits at X exit velocity and Y launch angle to maximize the value of them.
The data collected during the training period feeds into the information we can gather from a formal assessment, gathering a more complete picture.
Both pitching and hitting are incredibly difficult, so the more information you can get to learn more about just one piece of the puzzle is incredibly beneficial.
It’s not technology and data vs. coaching. Technology and data can fill in the gaps of what players and coaches have been trying to figure out forever. The average coach intuitively knows more about the game than any number can tell him.
But the best coaches are going to be the best translators. Being able to take the data and communicate it to an athlete so they both understand where they are now, and where they need to be.
The clear advantage goes to the coaches who can build relationships and communicate what players need to do to improve while using data to track progress.
Coaches know the players best and know how they can get the message across, each athlete is different so the best coaches will be able to match the data to the player in a way that they can understand.
Having a good formal-assessment process means that your program will have individualization baked into it. Assessments drive programming, meaning you meet each player where they are and then give them goals to improve on.
Measuring all of these pieces isn’t the end all be all, because of course we all want athletes to perform best in a game situation. What measuring these data points does is gives you a much clearer picture of how a player can develop and that’s the next stage of the game.

Driveline Plyo Ball ® Routine - Driveline Baseball,2017-12-22T05:56:55+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/12/plyo-velocity-weighted-balls-replication/,"This blog will dive into the importance of having a plyo ball ® routine, examples of a Driveline plyo ball® routine, and how you can use a plyo ball® routine for velocity gains.
A Driveline plyo ball® routine consists of throwing plyo balls® prior to any work with a baseball. From research in our lab, we know that heavier balls (including leather overload balls) make the arm travel slower. Thus making them great for a warm-up. So what specifically makes it a ‘Driveline’ routine? It all comes down to tailoring or creating a plyo ball® routine based on the movement deficiencies. At Driveline, we identify these issues through our biomechanics lab and the athlete’s motion capture report. Our coaches will then tailor a plyo ball® routine based on those findings., let’s dive into some basics.
As a reminder, at Driveline we use both Plyo Ball’s® and weighted balls. Plyo balls® are what we use every day in our constraint pitching drills nearly every day at sub-max intent. Weighted balls are typically used for catch play, such as long toss, and velocity work.
The following is a comprehensive list of our current plyo ball® drills. This list does not include any drill focuses or slight modifications our coaches may use with an athlete.
Reverse throws – these will always be performed first
Pivot picks – Always follow reverse throws
Each athlete that trains with us will perform 2 of the bolded exercises depending on what they need to work on
Scap Retraction
Roll ins
Step backs
Drop steps
Janitors
Rockers
Walking windups – The last exercise performed in our driveline plyo ball routine
The number of drills, the intensity of the throws, and the volume of throws change depending on the day.
There are typically three types of training days that we schedule:
Recovery days – these are lower effort days, typically thrown at 50-60% intensity
Hybrid days – these are medium effort days. Hybrid B’s are thrown around 70% intensity, Hybrid A’s reach 90% intensity.
Velocity days – these are high effort or high intent days. The highest effort throws on these days are going to be at max 100% effort.
There are also different variations of these days that we will program, which variation is programmed depending on the time of year. We break up an athlete’s training into different training phases, with each phase having a specific focus. These phases include:
You can read more about how different training phases fit together here.
Plyo balls® can increase velocity. So long as they are used properly within a structured throwing program. In other words, buying a plyocare set and then throwing them max effort is not a good idea and, very possibly, will not increase throwing velocity.
This is why there are limits to specific drills to gain velocity. Certain drills are important, to address players’ movement patterns, but making sure that all the days fit together on a weekly and monthly basis is important to help players improve.
How can you leverage plyocare balls to maximize your chances to throw harder? It all comes down to having a plan.
If you feel throwing mechanics is a potential factor holding back your velocity, then performing specific drills with them (such as pivot picks to help improve your arm action) can be a great addition to your warm-up routine. When used in this manner, throwing plyocare balls can be a very useful tool to potentially increase velocity.
Additionally, throwing plyo balls® at a high intensity after a proper on-ramp period can also be a method to improve throwing velocity. As there are numerous studies showing the positive effects overload and underload training has on throwing velocity.
Having a plan is also more than just having a throwing routine. There are athletes who can throw harder because:
As touched on earlier, after a proper on-ramp period, throwing plyo balls® at a high intensity (synonymous with max effort) can be a viable method to improve throwing velocity. One part of having a PlyoCare® ball routine for velocity is knowing that you have drills that are focused on movements you need to improve. Athletes can perform these drills multiple times a week at medium to low intent. Then during a velocity phase, when performing a PlyoCare®velocity, they will perform the drills at 100% effort.
However, the frequency of when you throw them max effort must be taken into consideration. If players perform a PlyoCare®ball® routine for velocity too frequently, such as 3x/week, is not recommended.
The key to using a driveline PlyoCare® ball routine successfully is not only understanding the drills that you are working on, but also understanding the purpose of each training day.
A good starting point is throwing them max-effort 1x or 2x/week, with lower intensity throwing days completed in between. Don’t be afriad to start with one velocity day per week and see how you feel after a few weeks. This is a case where more isn’t better, we don’t want to perform velocity work 3x per week as that’s too much high intent throwing.
The table below provides an overview of how a Driveline PlyoCare® ball routine changes throughout the week.
Having a PlyoCare® routine is important because athletes should know what they need to work on to throw harder and have a path to do so with the best drills. Using a Driveline Plyo ball ® routine for velocity is more than just drills but knowing how much and at what intensity you should throw each day.

I asked Motus  to add the tag so we could look at the towel drill.(which some organizations still swear by, still thought to be arm saving. We did our case study with 20 high school guys and got mixed results. Trunk angle and other biomechanics lead to different results. Was less stress for some guys and very high stress for others. Goes to show you cant assume things are ‘good’ for every guy. Would love to see you guys repeat that stidy with  your pro population.

Just wondering if there is any data on how Plyo ball velos translate to the mound. I saw the chart in this article and it looks like the 83.4 gray Plyo ball throw was equal to an 89 mound throw.  Not sure if I can read the chart that way since it was more for stress than velo and it was the average of 18 athletes. I threw a Walking Wind-Up Velo of 85 with the gray Plyo ball.  Is that greater than, less than or equivalent to what my mound velo might be?
Generally, the velocities with the gray ball are closest to mound velo’s. Typically, your velocity should increase from each plyoball as you go down in weight.

Coaches Series: Year-Round Programming - Driveline Baseball,2017-12-21T04:56:02+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/12/coaches-series-year-round-programming/,"This post from our Coaches Series was written by Justin James, Assistant Coach at University of California, San Diego. He took over there in January 2017, having coached the previous seven seasons at Point Loma Nazarene University.
In previous posts, I covered implementing Driveline Protocols to a new staff only 30 days before first pitch, then followed with a Season Recap on how the implementation was a success. In this post I will cover year three of fall ball with my staff using Driveline WBs and Plyo Ball ®.
As pitching coaches, or any collegiate coach for that matter, we dread the breaks. During summer and Christmas break, per NCAA rules, we are not to monitor or control our staff regardless of safety concerns or how much better they want to get. That said, a solid, detailed plan broken up into “phases” must be easy to follow and easy to test for when your staff gets back from breaks without supervision.
With this in mind, teaching and allowing for self-awareness and accountability is beyond crucial.
Sometimes this leads to small setbacks, but it’s a necessity if you want a year-round pitching plan to actually be followed. Staff must be tested regularly and scheduled with consistency so complacency doesn’t set in with your guys.
Before each new “season”(start of fall, end of fall, return from Christmas, near end of season), a testing or baseline must be administered. This is for accountability, motivation, health, and the overall excitement of seeing ups and downs of developing. Keeping a track record of testing numbers is a great way to make sure your pitching program is heading in the right direction, and it’s also a great way to look for improvements with individual pitchers and the staff as a whole.
Once back from break, I always administer a WB testing session in week one, followed by Plyo Ball ® testing in week two. (This can be flipped or mixed at your discretion.) New members to the staff really enjoy this time because it gives them the competition element to training that was, for the most part, missing during the summer months.
This helps show gains, pitchers’ work ethic during the “off” months, and helps create their range velo-wise to accomplish recovery, hybrid, and high-output days. Without a baseline, they may not know what their difference is between hybrids and recovery days; this allows for more consistency and in return keeps them safer.
Not all arms are on the same summer or “off season” plan. Some go to summer ball and throw different amounts, and some stay home to train for various reasons. This particular year, we had new guys coming in playing summer ball and returners pitching all the way into August. I decided with these guys to train them differently than the rest of the staff.
I just let the new staff members pitching in summer ball pitch without trying to remotely train them for safety and over-training purposes. However, I provided example videos and articles to help them understand the process they would be doing once September training began; I said watch the videos a few times and read the “Why.” I personally felt more comfortable in this particular approach.
Returners that threw a ton over the summer and calendar year would not pitch off a mound for at least a month once they came back; they would be on a recovery and on-ramping plan until the middle of October. They trained like the offseason guys, were tested several times, and did a variation of the summer plan but not as extensive or intensive because of the short fall time frame and need to face hitters. Notably, these guys already had been in the program and very comfortable with the process, so they were technically in maintenance mode all summer long, so the gap wasn’t too large to implement this plan.
Strength and movement patterns are extremely vital in the fall. Getting on the same page with your strength guy and knowing each other’s plans is invaluable. That’s where we made huge improvements this year. Our Strength and Conditioning coach, Jon Gregory, has been unbelievable in implementing our plan, and he takes the time to learn what we are doing from the pitching side. We had a few sit-down sessions where we discussed what to look for pattern wise, our daily drills, conditioning, etc. We tried to line up our “recovery” days better on both the throwing and lifting sides. This worked out great. It helped me not over train our guys, which at times I might have. I didn’t have to condition guys like in the past, because I know what I wanted was already being done in the weight room. This fall was the least amount I have ever conditioned my pitching staff, and I feel way better with the overall approach. I would still do my staple conditioning drills but with less volume and more intensity, allowing for more recovery and corrective-style exercises (with limited NCAA hours per week, this helped greatly).
Our fall consisted of five days per week. Here are some of the results from the beginning of fall and the end of fall Plyo Ball ®-testing numbers:
In-game velocities were recorded and will be compared once the season starts for a more accurate reading, especially from the returners. Notably, many of the returners had gains, but not as massive as some of our new members. This is typical because they have been improving for over a year and gains will take even more work going forward. (This is explained in HTKC.)
Here is what occurred during the fall (the first time facing live hitters/last intra-squad). Sixteen pitchers threw in both first and last intra-squad. Pitchers usually have a small increase with adapting to the fall’s demands, in both throwing and in the weight room. I am pleased with these numbers:
All great changes worth anything take time. Sure, some instant results do occur from time to time, because simply cleaning up habits, movement patterns, and behaviors can help someone that was deficient in those areas. I mention that because this fall I made some minor tweaks to the fall program, and it’s too early to see if they were the root cause for the improvement within the staff. Our testing numbers jumped significantly, so everything is recorded to make sure a better plan is put forth every season.
Here are a few obvious changes we’ve done that many of you may already do in some degree or another:
I hope everyone has a great break and end to their fall. I highly recommend re-reading and sharing with your staff some of the new material in the updated HTKC. It’s well done, and it allows you to very easily communicate your intentions to your staff using the resources provided with the book/program.

Scaling Velocity & Useful Spin in Offspeed Pitches - Driveline Baseball,2017-11-17T04:52:12+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/11/scaling-velocity-useful-spin-offspeed-pitches/,"We still don’t know a whole lot about spin rate. While we certainly know more about how to use it under certain situations, we don’t know that much on how to develop better spin.
Because of this, we are running smaller experiments to get a better idea of what to test and what to look for.
The idea is that smaller tests lead to bigger samples that lead to better understanding and, in the end, better athlete results.
First, let’s recap the things we do know about spin rate before looking at our own data.
For four-seam fastballs, it’s pretty straightforward. High-spin fastballs result in more flyballs and swing-and-misses and are more valuable thrown middle up in the zone. Low-spin fastballs result in more ground balls and are more valuable thrown down in the zone. If you have an average spin rate, your best bet is going to be learning a two-seam.
For offspeed pitches, it gets it bit more tricky. We can say that having a high-spin offspeed pitch is generally a good thing. But the useful spin, or spin aligned with the axis of the ball, is of more use than the total spin. Now, the numbers we get from MLB can’t give us the useful spin, but we can get a useful spin reading using a Rapsodo.
So what can the Rapsodo show us about useful spin in offspeed pitches when trying to practice them?
We wanted to replicate different practice situations, throwing curveballs and sliders at low intent off a mound and on flatground, to see if the useful spin would change when compared to pitching at 100% intent.
We are trying to answer the question: What is the best way to practice offspeed pitches to make them better in a game?
In this study we’ll look at total and useful spin before focusing in on the useful spin, or spin-efficiency number. Spin efficiency is the percentage of spin that is lined up with the axis of the ball. While true spin or useful spin is the RPM of spin lined up with the axis of the ball.
We used a few athletes and a couple employees on throwing programs to throw offspeed pitches for this study. We had each athlete warm up and throw five offspeed pitches at 100% off a mound, then five offspeed pitches at 75%, followed by five throws at 75% from flatground. We used the Rapsodo, which we’ve previously validated to Trackman readings, to measure ball spin.
We split up the pitches to sliders and curveballs, and here is what we found looking at velocity, total spin, and true (useful spin).
Note: Pitcher 3 throws from a lower arm slot. So his curveball is more of a slurve, where pitchers 1 & 5 throw more over the top.
While this isn’t enough to make sweeping conclusions, it’s important to look at some of the individual differences. We aren’t sure why these differences occur, but the best guess is that athletes all downregulate their throwing motions in different ways. This alone might be enough evidence to suggest that practicing offspeed pitches is not a “one size fits all” program.
It’s important to realize that with curveballs you generally want a high-spin efficiency, so a higher true spin. With sliders, you are looking for a low-spin efficiency. This can be confusing, but comparing the true spin of curveballs and sliders will help put this idea into perspective.
The data for both charts can be found here
This is a lot to look at for a small sample size. We can see the drastic differences between the Units and useful spin of curveballs compared to sliders. Second we can see that some of the differences in spin efficiency can be pretty drastic and individualized.
Remember, the goal of practice is to get better at a skill. We can look at the differences in spin efficiency and think:
If we are practicing offspeed pitches at a different spin efficiency, are we truly practicing to get better at that pitch?
Although we don’t have the current ability to measure release point, we can suggest that the changes we see in useful spin are because the release points or wrist action change slightly. This goes back to the idea that pitchers don’t repeat their mechanics exactly the same for every throw. These slight changes increase when we tell athletes to slow down their mechanics. Each athlete will throw at lower intent in a different way.
Also, we have moved away from most flatground work. We found the differences in elbow stress to be minor compared to the differences in velocity. So even though current research supports the idea that there is little difference between elbow torque of fastballs and offspeed pitches, there are still workload concerns in throwing a lot of flatgrounds.
Plus, there is not a direct transfer between having good mechanics on flatground directly correlating to good mechanics on the mound.
This isn’t to say that flatgrounds don’t have any place in practice, but they are often overused. We can all remember the teammate who “one more his way-ed” to 10 more sliders on flatground to get the movement right. This isn’t going to be a beneficial use of an athlete’s training economy.
Now it’s important to note that we’ve been discussing throwing offspeed at different levels for the purposes of development, which is different from preparing for a game.
If athletes are warming up for a game and have a specific routine, they should continue to experiment with what makes them feel comfortable and the most prepared.
But when you are trying to develop a pitch, this data pushes us to the idea that we should stay away from extensive offspeed-pitch practice at low intent from flatground or the mound.
This is for two reasons, first flatgrounds are more stressful than believed, meaning you are incurring a higher training cost than you are accounting for. Second if the useful spin is different, you probably aren’t practicing throwing a pitch the same way it’ll be thrown in a game.
This requires us to look closer at our own programming, but we are aiming to create more time for athletes to throw in game like scenarios with real time feedback from the technology we provide.
We use both the Rapsodo and high-speed cameras to develop pitches. The Rapsodo gives us feedback on the velocity, spin rate, spin axis and useful spin. While our cameras, mainly Edgertronic, give us a glimpse of how small grip and finger changes affect how the ball comes out of the hand.
Now not everyone is going to be able to use buy an Edgertronic, but there are still other cameras that can be helpful. Here is an alternative that we would recommend.
Improvements to this study may include:

Very cool. When you talk about sliders having less spin efficiency, you’re stating that the axis and the spin shouldn’t match each other?

Pitch Grips and Changing Fastball Spin Rate - Driveline Baseball,2017-11-09T02:58:41+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/11/pitch-grips-changing-fastball-spin-rate/,"We still don’t know much about why pitchers can spin the same pitches differently, and we don’t know that much about ball flight either.
But in working with a variety of pitchers on pitch development, we’ve seen some interesting differences in spin rate with our athletes. Some of these differences are interesting enough that we wanted to see if the changes individual players saw would apply to others.
So, we compared fastball grips and the effects that each grip had on spin rate. The four different grips we looked at included a standard four-seam fastball, a close-grip fastball, a three-finger fastball, and a wide-grip fastball:
To try and standardized the grips, the athletes were all told to align their first knuckle across the horseshoe seam on each grip.
Each pitcher threw five times with each grip, in the order of regular grip, close grip, three-finger grip, and wide grip. They were also instructed to have their thumb position consistent throughout the different grips.
Because we’ve seen that fastball spin rate scales linearly with velocity, we asked our athletes to throw between 75-80 mph, meaning we used Spin to Velocity Ratio to compare the differences in spin rate.
Below is the data from a previous post suggesting fastball spin rate scales linearly with velocity.
Here are the numbers we found.
The data can be found here.
These are some pretty interesting numbers, suggesting that grip may play some role in fastball spin rate.
In our original piece on SVR, we said that the MLB league average for a four-seam fastball was 23.9, which, for simplicity sake, we say is 24. Even with a small sample, we see the regular grip was at 24.04 and the close-finger grip was 24.06.
Both are nearly right at the average SVR, suggesting that moving your fingers together doesn’t do much to affect spin rate.
The two biggest differences we see are with the three-finger grip and the wide-split grip.
This counterintuitively suggests that both adding more contact, by an extra finger on top, and using less contact, by spreading the fingers really wide, reduces spin rate.
How can this happen? Unfortunately, we don’t really know because we don’t know all the reasons for why spin rate occurs, but it appears that grip can play a role in fastball spin rate.
This was a small sample so it’s worth the time to look at each athlete individually. Even though we saw trends as a whole, it’s important to remember that individual athletes can see big differences as outliers.
We can see that two athletes did actually have an increase in spin rate with a close-finger grip, though one was only by 0.1 SVR, the other by 0.8. This could mean that pitching with a close finger grip is worth experimenting with for the athlete who saw an increase in 0.8 but not the others.
While one athlete had a higher SVR on his split grip than his three-finger grip (by 0.2 SVR), two athletes had pretty drastic differences between the wide-split grip and their four-seam fastball. Every athlete’s three-finger and wide-split grip was lower than their regular fastball grip.
Looking at this, we have to mention hand size. The athletes who had the lowest SVR on the wide-split grip also had the smallest hands of the group. Those two were also the most uncomfortable throwing the wide grip because they felt like they couldn’t control it well.
With the three-finger grip, we know that many athletes add more fingers to the top of the ball when throwing a changeup. So this would anecdotally make sense that some sort of added contact changes how the ball rolls off the fingers as a pitch is thrown. But the why for how that happens is still unknown.
For the wide-split grip, we can look at statcast data to see that split-finger fastballs spin less when compared to a pitcher’s fastballs. We wouldn’t say that the athletes in this study were throwing splitters or forkballs, but this data suggests that after a certain point as fingers get further apart spin rate starts to decrease.
It is also possible that differences in hand size causes the same grip to have different effects, individual to each athlete.
All of these grips were novel to the pitchers, so we aren’t sure how the spin rate would change if they practiced throwing these different grips at high intensity over a period of time.
The feedback loop of how spin rate changes probably isn’t just how the grip affects the spin but also how the athlete feels with a grip. So it’s possible that the novelty of the grip caused other small changes in the hand or wrist action.
Pitching and pitch grips is often thought of a one way feedback loop; the grip changes the spin causing a different pitch. However, these numbers hint at the idea that hand size matters & an athlete’s feel for the grip matters.
Remember, we’ve seen in the study, Baseball Spin and Pitchers Performance (Open Access), that spin rate occurs in a incredibly short period of time.
This could mean that for learning new pitches, it isn’t just about learning a new grip. It’s testing out a grip, seeing how comfortable it feels, and then possibly changing wrist and hand position.
For example, a cutter grip usually isn’t too different from a fastball grip, but the wrist and hand action are different. But if a pitcher slightly changes his grip how much of the movement is coming from the grip and how much is coming from a different feel and hand motion? We don’t know.
This makes sense if you think of a pitcher who throws a really good offspeed pitch—say he has a great slider. His slider movement is probably going to change if you change the grip not only because a different seam orientation might change the ball flight but also if he finds the grip uncomfortable or more comfortable. There are probably small changes that we don’t see in wrist or hand movement or finger pressure that also change ball flight depending on how a grip feels to an athlete.
This would mean that classic “pitch grips” truly aren’t one size fits all. What you are really looking for is a range of grips that can be used for a pitch and then have the athlete work through each to see which feels comfortable and which produces the desired movement.
What this information should do is encourage more experimentation. We don’t know exactly why these changes occurred, but it is worth it for a player to experiment with these and other grips as it pays to be an outlier.

Great stuff as always guys, thank you! Did you monitor any the effect and change the grips had on spin efficiency? I am experimenting and trying to figure out how FB grip can improve spin efficiency for some pitchers.
Thanks!

Reviewing Offspeed Pitches and Elbow Torque - Driveline Baseball,2017-11-03T03:48:35+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/11/reviewing-offspeed-pitches-elbow-torque/,"With new research developments in other labs and our own facilities, we felt it was a good time to update our data set on offspeed pitches.
Previously, we looked at offspeed pitches and were able to come close to replicating peer-reviewed research with the Motus sensor. Essentially, fastballs were the most stressful pitches, with curveballs, sliders, and changeups all having less total torque on the elbow.
But we also wanted to see what would happen if we took velocity into account—mStress but for offspeed pitches. So we took the torque numbers and normalized them for their velocity to see if anything changed.
In fact, things did. We found all of the offspeed pitches had higher normalized relationships than fastballs.
A recently published study is the first to look at how throwing the slider compares kinetically to a fastball, changeup and curveball.
Since those four pitches make up the majority of pitches thrown in the Major Leagues, this is great news.
Eighteen professional pitchers from one organization participated, throwing 32-40 pitches in total. Each player threw 8-10 pitches of each pitch type. The three fastest pitches thrown for strikes were used for analysis.
Below are the torque values for the elbow and shoulder per pitch type, along with the ball velocity, from the above study.
Overall pitching biomechanics were similar among the slider, fastball, and curveball, with the biggest differences coming between the changeup and the other three pitches.
Below are a few other notable findings:
There were some small differences found elsewhere in the body between pitches.
Because of the small differences between pitches found in this study, the authors still point to velocity as the main contributor to injuries.
The authors also noted that “…pitching biomechanics can at best only estimate injury risk and not predict it through shoulder and elbow forces and torques.”
To pair with this new study, we also have updated our own numbers.
We pulled data from this summer to add to our database created in the pro offseason of 2016. Each comparison of the four fastest fastballs is compared to the four fastest of said offspeed pitch in the chart below.
The data can be found here.
Overall, fastball torque is slightly higher than the curveball, slider, and changeup. We see the relationship between fastballs to sliders and fastballs to changeups get closer with a bigger sample. Leaving the biggest difference in our sample between fastball and curveball torque. But when we normalized the torque for velocity, the relationships flip, just like we saw previously.
So where does this lead us?
First off, both the peer-reviewed study and ours involved college and professional athletes. So these findings should only apply to them. Like we mentioned in our previous article, there is more conflicting evidence with youth pitchers and offspeed pitches.
Just because these studies suggest that fastballs are the most stressful relative to other offspeed pitches doesn’t give youth athletes the green light to throw whatever they want.
The relationship with youth athletes is more complicated by workload concerns, mechanics, and a wider range of movement patterns.
Now, for professional pitchers, how this information is applied depends on how we want to look at the data. Should you use raw torque or mStress? We aren’t quite sure yet.
Because of the similarities in elbow torque it seems like we should start looking beyond the standard kinetics when comparing offspeed pitches. We understand that different pitches often involve slightly different rotations or twists of the wrist. It’s possible that there are more dramatic differences in wrist kinetics than the elbow between pitches.
It’s also possible that those differences can change how the muscles in the forearm work. Leaving the overall torque similar but distributed in a different way.
In the end, the new research still lines up with the research that came before. It looks increasingly likely that any evidence that shows that certain pitches are more stressful than others will come from outside of the standard kinetics. We look forward to continuing our own research and seeing what we find.

Stability & Pitching Mechanics - Driveline Baseball,2017-05-19T04:39:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/05/stability-pitching-mechanics/,"In Part 1 of this series, we talked about the importance of mobility in the pitching delivery. While mobility is crucial, stability is equally as important since it plays a critical role in injury prevention.
Mobility is defined as the ability to perform a desired movement; stability is defined as the ability to resist an undesired movement. Mobility relates to the actual movement while stability relates to the ability to control the joint through movement. Though by definition the two are opposite, they are complementary in performance.
In Part 1 we talked about mobility in the scapula, thoracic spine, and hips. In Part 2, we’re going to dive into stability in the trunk, specifically the lumbar spine and the rotator cuff.
Why is a strong core essential for athletics? All athletic movements originate from the core. The muscles in the core consist of the pectoralis major, external oblique, internal oblique, rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, and hip adductors.
These muscles are meant to stabilize the lumbar spine for rotation, extension, and flexion. Having a stable core allows for acceleration and deceleration during movement.
Anti-extension exercises are any exercises in which you are trying to resist extension of the spine. Baseball players spend a large amount of their time standing in extension or excessive anterior tilt of the hips. Anterior tilt of the hips means that your hips are tilted downward, or toward the front of your body, creating a lengthened posterior chain. Anterior tilt of the hips can lead to pulled hamstrings, anterior knee pain, and hip pain.
The purpose of anti-extension exercises is to encourage posterior tilt as well as engage anterior core and lumbo-pelvic hip stabilizers.
Dead Bug – Take a big inhale promoting 360-degree expansion into torso and lower contralateral limbs in an effort to resist extension, full exhale at the bottom of each rep.
Hard Style Plank – Pull elbows and feet towards each other while squeezing glutes as tightly as possible.
Anti-rotation is right up there with scapular movement in degree of importance for baseball athletes. While it is essential for baseball players to be strong and rotationally explosive to throw with velocity or hit for power, it is equally important to be strong and stable to resist rotation. Any exercise in which you are trying to resist rotation through the spine is an anti-rotation exercise.
Hip-shoulder separation is a key factor in pitching development. It is difficult for athletes to dissociate the rotation between the hips and shoulders. Having anti-rotation core stability allows athletes to keep their trunks closed while their lower halves and hips rotate open. Being stable through rotation allows rotation to occur through the thoracic spine rather than the lumbar spine after getting to foot strike.
A great example of how mobility and stability compliment each other is the relationship between the thoracic and lumbar spine. Similar to what we talked about in part one, if athletes lack thoracic mobility, they will sacrifice stability for mobility in the lumbar spine to create “fake separation.”
Because of all of the rotation that occurs in baseball, such as swinging and throwing, baseball players must be able to decelerate rotation. This is why there is an abundance of oblique strains in Major League Baseball.
The goal for anti-rotation exercises is to keep the rib cage locked into the pelvis, rotate the hips, and remove pressure from the spine into the working muscles.
Standing Anti-Rotation Cable Iso-Hold – Hold the external load straight out from your chest without allowing the load to pull you.
Pallof Press – Press straight out with the external load not allowing the weight to pull you.
Anti-Rotation Cable Chop – Rotate the external load using only your arms without letting the torso rotate at all.
The muscles that make up the rotator cuff are the teres minor, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and subscapularis. Since repetitive throwing leads to anterior shoulder laxity, rotator-cuff strength provides stability in the glenohumeral joint for injury prevention.
In Part 1 of this series, we talked about the importance of scapular movement. According to the joint-by-joint approach, the glenohumeral joint should be mobile while the scapula should be stable. However, if athletes don’t have sufficient stability in their glenohumeral joint, it’s likely that they also don’t have stability in their scapulas; another great example of how mobility and stability work together.
While it’s important to have stability in the scapula regarding protraction and retraction, mobility is necessary for upward rotation. Similarly, while mobility in the glenohumeral joint plays a role in elevating the arm into scapular plane and internal and external rotation, the rotator cuff’s main function is to provide stability to center the humeral head in the glenoid fossa. In addition to assisting in glenohumeral range of motion, the rotator cuff assists in internal and external force production, which is essential for throwing a baseball.
As far as training the rotator cuff goes, the idea is to perform exercises that force the rotator cuff to “grab onto” the ball in socket—pretty much any exercise while holding a dumbbell or barbell causes the rotator cuff to fire.
When training the rotator cuff, it is important to understand that because of the small size of the muscles, we do not want to train them to fatigue. When the rotator cuff is fatigued, the humeral head will shift towards the acromion process, increasing the likelihood of shoulder impingement. Therefore, while band work is great for activating muscles pre-throwing and recovery post-throwing, excessive band work is unnecessary and can potentially be more harmful.
Half-Kneeling External Rotation Rhythmic Stabilizations – In scapular plane, gently tap the elbow and upper arm for 10 seconds, forcing rotator cuff to “grab on.”
Upward Throws – A great post-throwing recovery exercise we use in gym. Start in internal rotation and externally rotate up, tossing the ball. Catch on the way back down and control the internal deceleration.
90/90 External Rotation Iso-Holds – With back up against the wall in scapular plane, have your shoulder, elbow, and hand all against the wall, press back of hand into wall and hold for 1-2 seconds.
Bottoms Up KB Carry – Another great post-throwing recovery exercise in gym to stabilize the rotator cuff after throwing. Elbow slightly below shoulder, keep biceps relaxed and core engaged.
Mobility and stability needs are not always black and white. It’s important to assess athletes for movement and strength to determine what their individual needs are before programming. Regarding mobility and stability needs, understand the joint-by-joint approach, determine the soft-tissues surrounding each joint, and have an understanding of the needs of the surrounding joints and how they affect movement.
Most importantly, understand that mobility and stability, while their definitions are opposites, work together in unison to help the body move as efficiently as possible.

Return to Throwing Program,2015-09-30T14:05:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/05/data-driven-rehabilitation-tommy-john-surgery-troy-rallings-case-study/,"The traditional model for phases of rehab that occur after Tommy John surgery look something like this:
This blog will focus on improvements that can be made in a return to throwing program.
ThiThis blog was updated on 6/3/2022 and was written by Dean Jackson and Kyle Lindley, edited by Michael O’Connell
Below is an example of what an Interval Throwing Program may look like.
It’s our opinion at Driveline Baseball that this type of program has three major flaws:
Let’s break them down:
Your first day throwing on this program involves two sets of “warm-up throws” and 50 total throws from 45 feet. If you split the difference on the warm-up throws and call it 15 throws each (10-20 per the document), then you are making 80 total throws on your first post-surgery throwing day!
The most common side effect of these types of programs involves soreness and setbacks due to the inability to overcome the volume of the program. This can create a vicious cycle of starting, stopping, and restarting a throwing program.
Our article detailing “pulldown” throws goes into a bit of detail, but players need to be tested at game-like intensities before they return to competition. We need to make sure that they are occurring at the appropriate time
Secondly, there is no monitoring outside of distance. Pitchers going out to 180 feet on this program do so at varying angles, velocities, and intent. Throwing at 40 mph or 60 mph at 60 feet should not be equal.
This program cannot be equally effective for the MLB pitcher who sits 95 MPH and the 17-year-old who sits 83 MPH. Other than different starting points, there are drastically different resources available to one over another.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also has its flaws as a measure of intensity.
Previous research has shown that the percentage of effort that a pitcher is trying to throw at does not correlate strongly with how hard the pitcher is throwing compared to their velocity peak (Slenker, Limpisvasti, et al. – Biomechanical comparison of the interval throwing program and baseball pitching: upper extremity loads in training and rehabilitation AJSM May 2014).
At 60% of perceived effort, pitchers were generating forces of 76% and ball speeds approaching 84% of maximum intensity.
Pitchers are really bad at estimating how much effort they are expending and consistently underestimate it. This should have profound implications for rehabilitation programs.
Programs are often written in a way that doesn’t account for the rest of a player’s life.
Some baseball players returning from surgery have a nice, smooth recovery process. Others do not. Some players’ bodies won’t let them progress for a few weeks. Other athletes feel incredible, and they feel ahead of schedule. It’s a rollercoaster to try and help a player along with  Physical Therapists and surgeons.
They are difficult to adjust in all areas because everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Because of this, there will often be some sort of setback due to throwing volume and intensity. After all, everyone will respond differently to a program. But we need to remember that other factors outside of the throwing program can also cause setbacks. Lack of sleep, varying nutrition, school load, or travel are a few reasons that can also cause setbacks.
The fact of the matter is tools exist today that can raise the standards of Tommy John rehab. We want a standardized approach but an individualized method.
The solution is to use technology to better track progress and make programs individualized. This means utilizing
Combined with subjective measures, these objective measures give us the best chance for the next revolution of rehab programs.
Using Pulse and a radar gun, we can monitor the following variables:
You can read more about the metrics on Pulse here.
We can use those to better supplement subjective measures by asking the athlete questions such as:
We can combine these to create the four main phases of our return to throwing program:
We can layer on more extensive monitoring with Pulse and Radar Gun inside these phases.
Arm Speed will be used as our primary monitoring tool until ~700 RPM Arm Speed. Reaching ~700 Arm Speed typically occurs after several weeks of throwing.
Once ~700 RPM arm speed is reached, we would switch to a combination of arm speed and throwing velocity. Arm speed and velocity would be used to continue progressing intensity through the remainder of the rehab. We choose ~700 RPM Arm Speed because that is approximately where Pulse Arm Speed starts to deviate from throwing velocity.
We would progress intensity using object data (arm speed and throwing velocity) and subjective data from that point on. Focusing on how he felt he was recovering, how his mechanics looked like his, and how his body responded well to the increased intensity.
The example below is from a return to throwing program with athlete Ryan Cloude. This example represents a sample of what can be done with a data-driven return to throwing program. The advice dispensed in this article would certainly not work for everyone for the reasons stated above. We know how weighted balls affect the torque on the arm and workload, the example program below only used baseballs.
Ryan Cloude is a 21-year-old collegiate pitcher. He has an interesting training history, having increased his pitching velocity from 83mph as a college freshman to topping at 95mph as a junior. In the middle of his junior season, he tore his UCL and required UCL reconstruction.
The goal of this phase was to build a throwing volume base at a low intensity. We start all our athletes off with a low threshold to set them up for increased intensity later.
Ryan threw 3x per week during this 4-week phase. We monitored Arm Speed with Pulse, gradually increasing from a one-session average of ~200 RPM and top 1/8th ~250 RPM to a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM.
Total throws per session increased from 25 to 90 from the beginning to the last day of the phase.
We built this phase of the throwing volume base established in Phase 1 by increasing the throwing intensity on Monday and Friday each week.
Once Ryan hit the ~700 RPM arm speed mark, we switched measuring intensity from Arm Speed to throwing velocity.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM to a one-session average of ~600 RPM and top 1/8th ~850 RPM. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 49.9 mph and top 1/8th 57.6 mph to a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th 76.0 mph.
Instead of throw counts, Ryan was given options between 60-90 throws on the higher intensity days. At the same time, lower intensity days progressed gradually from 90 to 120 throws. He did the max number of throws most days, except for three days where the daily notes had some variation of “another crazy conditioning at 6 am this morning, body felt dead. Stopped at 60 throws”—no arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
One week, the same intensity was repeated (instead of progressing it) because Ryan was exhausted from team conditioning and didn’t want to push it.
Return to throwing templates lack guidelines on how to make adjustments to the program. At times the adjustment doesn’t need to be because something went wrong with the throwing program. But other parts of a player’s life are still ongoing when rehabbing a throwing injury. Tracking these programs leaves a player and a coach in a much better place to make an appropriate adjustment.
The only difference between the schedule of this phase and the last is that instead of the weeks going HLH, HLH (higher intensity, low, higher, and repeat), they went HLH, LHL (higher intensity, low, repeat). This shifted Ryan from 4 higher intensity throwing days every two weeks to 3 high-intensity throwing days every two weeks.
There were two new additions in phase three. First, bullpens at lower intensity began in this phase. Second, we started to focus more on moving efficiently. We measure movement efficiency by throwing the prescribed velocity with the lowest possible arm speed.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~600 and top 1/8th of ~850 to a one-session average of ~700 and top 1/8th of ~ 925. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th of 76.0 mph to a one-session average of 69.6 mph and top 1/8th of 89.4 mph.
His volume options remained 60-90 on higher intensity days and 90-120 on lower intensity days. Ryan decided not to throw the max amount of throws on a given day: total body soreness from training with his team and getting kicked out of the gym as it was closing. No arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
Bullpen throwing velocity was dropped back to the high 70s, with two pens being thrown each week, and lower intensity days were added over a couple of weeks until Ryan was throwing five days a week.
Throwing velocity on main bullpen days gradually increased from a one-session average of 64.5 mph and top 1/8th of 77.4 mph to a one-session average of 74.2 and top 1/8th 90.9 mph.
We had phases that we wanted to progress through and a good idea how roughly how much we should progress over a certain period, but ultimately we let Ryan’s body decide if it was ready to progress or not.
If the prescribed intensity for a session wasn’t comfortable, we would not progress intensity in the next session (regardless of what the program template said). We would repeat the intensity (or reduce it) until it was comfortable. The main idea in the intensity prescribing process was “letting the door be opened” when Ryan’s body was ready and not trying to “kick the door down” and force a more intense stimulus on his arm before it was ready.
Other pitch types were added first to recovery days during this phase. Simply by throwing offspeed in flat ground or catch play/long toss work. Intensity and volume were gradually increased until Ryan was throwing at maximum intensity on the mound.
Volume options for total throws on each bullpen day gradually increased from 60-90 to 90-110, while volume options for lower intensity days stayed 90-120. Once Ryan’s velocity got back into the high 80’s a few bullpens turned into recovery days because he didn’t feel fully recovered.
The first live session versus hitters happened roughly 10.5 months post-op and went well enough that Ryan decided he was ready to face hitters in a game that counted for his team. The first outing versus hitters in a real game happened just before the 11-month post-op mark and resulted in 1IP 0H 0BB 3K.
After completing his return to play, Ryan reflected on the process as a whole:
“Having objective data to show my progress was massive for my mental state. On days where I wasn’t able to hit my goal or days where I felt I was so far away from being healthy, I’d be able to look back and see how much harder I was throwing and how much more arm speed I was able to handle.”
It’s widespread to hear athletes talk about the mental toll injuries took on them and how grueling the whole experience is. I believe collecting data to give athletes a good idea of where they are now, where they have been, and where they need to go can significantly improve how comfortable their experience with rehab ends up being.
Ryan also said:
“(I) loved having a progression based on how I was recovering and not a cookie-cutter program that’s the same for everyone.”
We’re attacking it via our integrated staff training methods, technology, and Driveline TRAQ – and results have never been better, both on the performance AND rehab sides.

Basics of Pitch Design Using Rapsodo - Driveline Baseball,2017-04-23T08:40:16+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/04/basics-pitch-design-using-rapsodo/,"By this point, you’ve probably heard a lot about pitch design.
But how exactly do we go about designing pitches?
What are we looking for when working on a pitch?
What tools do we use?
How do we do it?
The most important tool we have in house is the Rapsodo. It provides instant feedback on the pitch’s velocity, spin rate, spin axis, and pitch break. This gives insight into what the pitch is actually doing, and by comparing to other MLB pitches, how it can be improved.
We also use a few other tools in order help our athletes get feedback on what they are doing right or wrong with a pitch. Spin Axis balls, which we simply mark up with a sharpie, provide a great visual tool to show an athlete what the spin axis of their pitch is.
We also use the Edgertronic high speed camera in order to see what exactly the fingers are doing at release point. This enables athletes to visually see what their hand and fingers are doing when they release the ball, and what they need to do to improve the pitch.
Using this trifecta of tools, the Rapsodo, spin axis balls, and high speed video, we have had a lot of success with pitch development in a relatively short period of time.
As mentioned previously the key to off-speed pitches isn’t the total spin, but the relationship between the spin rate and a pitch’s spin axis.
This is what makes Rapsodo so valuable to pitch development. Its camera can give us not only total spin but useful spin, the amount of spin that is lined up with the axis.
When developing a pitch, the useful spin metric is going to be your best friend.
Casey Weathers has been a main stay at Driveline Baseball since he moved up here to train in 2014.  Arriving here with significant arm pain and throwing in the high-80s, he has gotten himself healthy and throwing hard again. Besides being a beloved member of the Driveline family, he can also do this with a baseball:
He throws hard. But this off-season his major goal was developing a better secondary pitch. The past few years of Casey’s training focused primarily on healthy and velocity development, but Casey knew his second offering needed some work.
He’s always thrown a slider, but it was never really something he had ever tried to work on improving, nor did he have the necessary tools to improve it.
Analyzing his current repetoire and velocity, arm slot and we decided that a pure gyrospin slider was the best pitch to develop. It played the best off his fastball rather than a loopier breaking pitch like a curve or slurve.
Pure gyrospin is the typical spin axis of many quality big league sliders. This meant that on Rapsodo, the pitch would have a spin efficiency close to 0%. What does a gyrospin slider look like?
Bonus GIF: Dylan Bundy's Slider Grip + Release for the Bundle of joy that is @PitchingNinja pic.twitter.com/df0b4Bdvo3
— Nick Pollack (@PitcherList) April 5, 2017
There was no guarantee Casey’s slider would move like that as arm slot, mechanics, and a wealth of other factors all play a role, but the gyrospin slider as the goal at least we had a target to improve against.
Casey’s first sliders had a spin efficiency of around 20-30%. Pitch design sessions are mostly just trial and error, as Casey worked to find which mental or physical cues and grips felt best and resulted in the best pitch. In addition to the “sniff test” (if the pitch looks good to the naked eye), we used the Rapsodo as feedback to measure total & useful spin.
The instant reads allowed good cues to be adopted quickly and tweaked and bad cues to be rejected, improving the accuracy of the feedback over time. To further tighten the feedback loop, we added Edgertronic and spin axis balls.
Using the Edgertronic and spin axis balls to determine the spin axis, Casey could see how his hand and wrist position would change pitch to pitch. This provided visual feedback on how his grip affected the spin of the pitch, in addition to the data feedback from the Rapsodo.
With all this going at once, the feedback loop was tight and accurate. An example discussion follows:
“Ok so you sort of hooked your wrist on that last one, causing it to spin more like a slurve or a bad curveball. Don’t hook it, just let the grip do it’s work.”
“So just stay on the side of the ball and throw it like a football.”
“Throwing the ball like a football” was a cue that really seemed to click with Casey (we arrived there after several others did not click). The ‘traditional’ slider grip, the index & middle finger on the horseshoes of the baseball, didn’t give the desired feel or spin efficiency changes. Casey essentially gripped it like a fastball, cutting the ball in half with his thumb and pointer finger and resting his middle finger on the outside of the ball. Then he threw it like a football.
An underrated bonus of using the Rapsodo and having this back-and-forth with the athlete is finding out which cues & visualization techniques work best for them. Throwing a new pitch is more complex than just a new grip, and athletes are going to have different interpretations of the same cue. Using the Rapsodo in this way can create a great feedback loop between what the athlete feels and what the data says the ball is actually doing.
Eventually, Casey was able to develop a tight slider that has a consistent spin efficiency around 5%. He was given the tools to do it, all it took was the right direction and plenty of repetitions.
https://twitter.com/drivelinebases/status/827420198009401345
This iterative pitch design method doesn’t just work for sliders. Because it is a fluid process with a discrete goal, it works for any pitch.
This off-season, we had pitchers develop a curveball (Dean Jackson) and a splitter, not to mention many other pitchers who learned made slight pitch adjustments after using the Rapsodo.
Dean wanted to improve the spin efficiency of his curveball so it would have more movement. Using the same methods as above (set a goal and experiment), Dean was able to improve the spin efficiency of his curveball from around 80% to above 90%, as well as his consistency with the pitch.
With Rapsodo providing the feedback of useful spin, he was also able to play around with different cues to improve the pitch.
The result of today's work on attempting to eliminate gyroscopic spin in my curveball pic.twitter.com/GuqJna05PN
First, he drew a line in sharpie around the ball on the specific spin axis he wanted to achieve. Then he played catch with a partner, throwing only that pitch, getting his own visual feedback and confirmation from his throwing partner.
Once he started to get a feel for it there, he started throwing it on Rapsodo with a bit higher intent to see spin axis, as well as the spin rate.
Using Edgertronic video he could see what his hand was doing at release when he threw a bad one. More often than not, his middle finger would drag down the ball at the last second, giving the ball an unstable, and incorrect, spin axis. He was able to correct this by slightly adjusting his grip, letting his middle finger just come off the ball, rather than dragging along the ball.
3 different pitches, 1 method. Dean improved an already good pitch in his arsenal, and Casey tried to make a not-great slider much better. All 3 pitchers worked on different pitches, but the method of developing, testing and refining was the same.
Pitch design is a hugely subjective process with plenty of trial and error. The way one athlete develops a pitch may be totally different from another. A grip that works for one pitcher may not feel good to another. Each athlete will have to find the grip, cue, and feel of a pitch on their own through some amount of trial and error.
The data (Rapsodo), visualization (high-speed video and spin axis balls), and feel all work together to help an athlete develop a pitch. Beyond that it is up to the athlete to interpret the information and make adjustments.
Yes, pitch design is a very individualized process, and it takes a lot of iterations to develop a pitch. Being able to provide athletes with the tools to provide as much information and feedback to the athlete makes it that much easier.

Spin Rate Part II: Spin Axis & Useful Spin - Driveline Baseball,2016-11-28T23:42:31+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/spin-rate-part-ii-spin-axis-useful-spin/,"Building on Part One of this series we’ll be looking at how spin rate actually causes pitches to move, and what we can do to affect this.
In our previous article we talked about the Magnus effect which, as a result of the backspin a thrown ball has, generates lift. With a higher spin rate this force is larger, leading to the hitter’s perception of the “rising fastball.” Conversely, a low spin rate fastball has a smaller Magnus effect, and is thus a sinking fastball.
The white arrow is air being pushed down behind the ball, the yellow arrow is the Magnus force pushing up
We know that higher spin rate fastballs lead to more swinging strikes. We know that we can affect a pitcher’s spin rate by throwing a splitter or a knuckleball. We know that spin rate and velocity are generally linearly related, and that a pitcher’s Spin to Velocity Ratio (spin rate (RPM) / pitch velocity (MPH)) is constant for any pitch velocity.
There’s a lot we do not know, but the rest of this post will attempt to fill in more of the gaps.
When describing spin axis in part one, we made the assumption that four seam fastballs are thrown with a perfect backspin, but this is never actually true.
Pitchers rarely (if ever) throw over the top with true backspin. The majority of pitches are thrown at an angle closer to 30-45 degrees which may result in natural cut or run. This picture below does a great job a representing that.
From: How baseball spin influences the performance of a pitcher: Nagami et al. (Open Access)
The left side of the picture shows the release angle of this group of pitchers is closer to 30-45 degrees. The picture on the right (from an overhead view) shows how the ball is redirected to the plate. Remember each pitcher’s arm moves closer to the shape of an oval and the release it a tangent to the target. The ball also will not often be lined up directly with home plate, because of positioning on the rubber, but often at an angle.
Recall that the Magnus effect is perpendicular to the spin axis of the ball. As the figure above shows, fastballs rarely spin perfectly end over end, meaning that the Magnus effect is rarely pointing perfectly upwards. Due to the fact that the ball is on a slight tilt, the Magnus effect acts on the ball at an angle, adding a slight horizontal force. The spin axis orientation at an angle is going to cause more side spin and less backspin, causing the ball to tail and possibly cause sink.
Professor Alan Nathan expand on some of these idea’s on an interview with him on the physics of pitching.
The image below shows the Magnus effect for a left-handed 4-seam and 2-seam fastball (or a right-handed cutter). The 4-seam fastball, as expected, has a perfectly vertical spin axis. The 2-seam fastball’s axis, however, points towards 11 o’clock, meaning that the Magnus force points in this direction, giving the ball a horizontal component of force that is pointed towards 1st base. This means the pitch has arm-side run for a lefty. For a right-handed 2-seamer (or left-handed cutter), the force is towards third base.

This ideal was expanded on further in the paper Factors Determining the Spin Axis of a Pitched Fastball in Baseball  T Jinji (Open Access).
Essentially the spin axis of each pitch is going to be significantly correlated with the orientation of the hands and fingers just before and at ball release.
This also make intuitive sense when also thinking about pitcher’s arm angles.
Changing spin axis is possible, but it might be more difficult than you think. Body control, and even more specifically finger control, is extremely difficult at the high speeds that pitches are thrown. Nevertheless, it is a key component of understanding how pitches move, and how they can be improved.
Also worth noting is the importance of a stable spin axis. A stable spin axis means that the seams of the ball rotate uniformly as the ball travels through the air. A stable spin axis results in not only more break, but more consistent break which can be easier to control.
Spin Axis of Various Pitches
The gifs below show various pitches being thrown by a pitching machine (on the left) and a pitcher (on the right).
Fastball:
As explained above, a fastball has pure backspin which results in a vertical Magnus force which negates some of the effect of gravity. In reality, however, most fastballs are thrown with some amount of tilt. 

Although the pitching machine pitches the ball on an unstable spin axis (notice how the ball appears to wobble), the backspin can be clearly seen in both gifs.
Slider:
Ideally, a slider has a much more horizontal spin axis than a cutter/ 2-seam, which results in the Magnus force pointing more horizontal than vertical. This results in an increase in lateral break as well as vertical break due to the decrease in lift.

As can be seen above, the pitching machine slider has a noticeably different spin axis than the pitcher’s slider. In reality, throwing a true slider is nearly impossible, and almost all sliders have some form of gyrospin attached to them. This is what hitters see when they talk about the “dot” on a slider. More on this later.
edit 11/3/2018: the ‘dot’ on a slider is also relative to a pitcher’s grip
Curveball:
A perfect 12-6 curveball spins end-over-end, or exactly the opposite as a true 4-seam fastball. This results in a Magnus force in the opposite direction as a fastball: downward. This gives curveballs their signature downward movement.

As with the slider, a perfect curveball is virtually impossible, and most non-pitching machine curveballs have some sort of tilt (not perfectly 12-6) as well as some gyroscopic spin. That being said, curveballs generally have proportionally much lower gyroscopic spin sliders, as can be seen above.
Splitter:
Splitters are thrown on basically the same axis as a 4 or 2-seam fastball, just with a greatly reduced spin. As a result, the Magnus effect is much smaller, meaning the gravitational force has a stronger net pull downward on the ball.

Naturally, It is much easier for athletes to throw a fastball than it is a curveball or slider, thus the pitching machine and the human splitter are rather similar. The main observation here is that the splitter spins noticeably slower than the fastball. The only noticeable difference between these two pitches is that the spin axis are slightly different.
4-Seam vs. 2-Seam
Beyond arm angle or release point, seam orientation has some effect on movement as well. 
In order to more clearly illustrate the effect of seam orientations, let us first consider a dimpled golf ball. Smooth air flows around the ball and leaves a turbulent wake behind the ball, otherwise known as drag, which slows down the ball. A dimpled ball leaves a smaller wake due to the fact that the flowing air can “stick” to the ball for a longer period of time due to the creation of a turbulent boundary layer. This means less drag on the ball, and thus the ball travels further. The effect can be seen in the image below.


Airflow around a smooth and dimpled golf ball, source
Now let us consider again the Magnus effect on the golf ball, and recall how the spinning ball redirects air downward. Knowing that the dimpled golf ball redirects more air than the smooth ball, it can be shown that the dimpled ball will have a greater Magnus effect, and thus greater lift, than the smooth ball. A dimpled ball means turbulent flow, which means a stronger Magnus effect.
This brings us back to baseball and try to make the connection from dimples to seams.
The difference between a 4-seam fastball and a 2-seam fastball is pretty easy to understand. The 4-seam fastball is thrown with an orientation that results in all four seams rotate uniformly into the oncoming air. A 2-seam fastball rotates such that only two of the seams encounter the airflow. This can be seen below.

Left: Four Seam Spin Axis / Right: Two Seam Spin Axis
Similar to the effect that the dimples has on a golf ball, the seams on a baseball create turbulence. With the 4-seam fastball, the seams can effectively grab the air and generate a greater Magnus force. The 2-seam fastball, however, has a large smooth section. This leads to a weaker boundary layer for that section of the ball, and thus a weaker Magnus force. 
For a “rising” fastball, this means that the 4-seam grip has more rise (or less drop) than the 2-seam grip. For a 2-seamer or cutter, the effect is a bit more complex. A two-seam gripped “sinker” would have more depth due to the weaker Magnus force, but less lateral movement than the same pitch thrown with a 4-seam grip.
Ultimately it is up to the pitcher to decide which grip optimally fits into their arsenal.
Useful Spin
Remember how we mentioned gyrospin above? As it turns out, all spin is not alike and not all spin helps movement. That is to say that it is really impossible to tell how good a pitch is just by the spin rate that TrackMan spits out.
But don’t go throwing out your $30,000 black box just yet.
As described by Dr. Alan Nathan in his article Determining the 3D Spin Axis from TrackMan Data (it’s a very dense read), a baseball has two primary components of spin: transverse spin and parallel spin, or gyrospin. 
Dr. Nathan notes that the Magnus force is only sensitive to the transverse spin, which travels perpendicular to the direction of the velocity of the ball (think perfect 4-seam axis). On the other hand, the gyrospin component, spinning like a football or bullet from a rifle, does not contribute to the Magnus force at all. An example of a gyroball is shown below.

To illustrate what this means in a practical sense, let’s look at 2 imaginary pitchers: Pitcher A and Pitcher B. The spin rate and true spin rate (transverse spin rate) are shown in a table below.


Knowing that transverse spin is the only component of spin that affects the Magnus force, we can assume that Pitcher A gets more break on his curveball, despite Pitcher B having a higher spin rate.
So how do we find the transverse spin, if TrackMan only gives us the raw spin rate? 
In his paper mentioned above, Dr. Nathan provides some very complicated and complex calculations to calculate the transverse spin based on the velocity data given by TrackMan, but these calculations include a +/- 500 rpm RMS error. This means that these calculated spin rate values have far too much variation to have any real practical value. 
Enter Rapsodo.
If you read our previous TrackMan vs Rapsodo validation article, you’ll have some idea of how Rapsodo works, and it’s potential uses going forward. In short, it is portable, smaller, and cheaper than the TrackMan, and has the ability to define the transverse spin axis, what it calls “True Spin.”.
Rapsodo uses optical tracking technology, while TrackMan uses radar, and can see the different axes of spin that a baseball may have. Rapsodo finds these three spin axes relative to the ball and converts them to create true spin, saving us from having to reinvent physics, and providing pitchers with a better tool to more effectively judge their pitches.
The true spin is going to relate highly to how much a pitch actually moves, whereas gyrospin does not affect movement.
Perhaps a pitcher’s slider has a high total spin rate, but spins purely gyroscopically like a washing machine. The spin rate values provided by tools like TrackMan are just not detailed enough to quantify the true value of a pitch. It may work as a general guide but won’t be an accurate measure for movement efficiency. Having a stable spin axis and high useful/true spin are the most vital pieces to a pitcher’s effectiveness. 
Conclusion
There is a good amount we have learned about spin rate. We know what effects the spin axes of a ball are, and how, in theory, the pitch should break. We know the difference between a 4-seam thrown pitch and a 2-seam pitch. We know that pitch break is only due to transverse spin, or true spin which is perpendicular the the pitch axis. And with this information we can better inform our pitchers and more effectively help them improve their pitches. 
But there is a lot we don’t know. We don’t know how to increase a pitcher’s spin rate. We don’t know what factors change spin rate (besides splitters), be it grip, limb length, hand size, mechanics, etc. We don’t objectively know how to change a pitcher’s spin axis. We have just become able to find the transverse spin axis, but we still don’t know how much a pitch will break given this.
We are, however, not afraid to admit that we don’t know everything. There’s no magic secret to spin rate, and there’s no magic secret to pitching. All we can do is give our athletes the access to the best resources and tools to throw harder and pitch better, while providing them with the best support and information we can offer.

If the slider spin creates a “dot” when looking from the batter’s view, then it must be “gyro rotation” which has no Magnus effect. I’m confused!

Not perfectly gyro though.  A batters eyes are positioned above the path of a (well positioned) slider.  The batter is looking down slightly toward the oncoming pitch.  So the slider is spinning slightly “tilted” from a gyroscopic spin position and the “dot” which the batter sees is slightly higher up the front of the ball than it would be if spinning gyroscopically.

So, to simplify this down, if a hitting sees a “dot” on a slider it is less effective (less break) than a more “slurvy” slider.  In other words, you don’t really want sliders with a “dot”.  “Dot” means too much gyroscopic spin.

Not exactly, there are a couple things here.
Seeing a ‘dot’ or not will also depend on the grip so it’s hard to use that as a reliable measure.
If you were designing a pitch in a vacuum then having a gyroscopic slider (lower spin efficiency) would be good. The less/no break comes from the way pitch movement is measured, a hitter will still see the ball move.
Whether a gyroscopic slider is good or not depends on the other pitches you throw and how they fit together. So some athletes may do better with a more slurvy slider and others will do better with a more gyroscopic slider.

Perfectly gyroscopic spin would not produce a “dot.” It would look more like a circle. This is what hitters refer to as the “cement mixer” slider. It does not break, and typically gets hit a long way. 
A tighter dot would be an illusion produced by the four seams of the baseball overlapping as they interrupt the area of this circle. Not exactly, but for thought exercise purposes: the tighter the dot, the more transverse spin on the slider.
Take a look at the slider and gyro gifs above, and imagine that everywhere a seam interrupts the surface of the ball gets colored dark. Focusing on the remaining white area will allow you to see the difference between the “dot” slider with useful movement and the “cement mixer” gyro that sits on a tee.

On a four seam Fastball do the seams of horse shoe go towards the pitchers ring finger? Does this affect the movement of the ball?

Jose- Yes, you are right. Typically, pitchers will have the seams towards the ring finger. Switching it around usually does not do much. If anything, it might alter the spin profile (efficiency or rate) but not in a good way.

A tighter dot would be an illusion produced by the four seams of the baseball overlapping as they interrupt the area of this circle. Not exactly, but for thought exercise purposes: the tighter the dot, the more transverse spin on the slider.
Take a look at the slider and gyro gifs above, and imagine that everywhere a seam interrupts the surface of the ball gets colored dark. Focusing on the remaining white area will allow you to see the difference between the “dot” slider with useful movement and the “cement mixer” gyro that sits on a tee.

On a four seam Fastball do the seams of horse shoe go towards the pitchers ring finger? Does this affect the movement of the ball?

Jose- Yes, you are right. Typically, pitchers will have the seams towards the ring finger. Switching it around usually does not do much. If anything, it might alter the spin profile (efficiency or rate) but not in a good way.

Airflow around a smooth and dimpled golf ball, source
Now let us consider again the Magnus effect on the golf ball, and recall how the spinning ball redirects air downward. Knowing that the dimpled golf ball redirects more air than the smooth ball, it can be shown that the dimpled ball will have a greater Magnus effect, and thus greater lift, than the smooth ball. A dimpled ball means turbulent flow, which means a stronger Magnus effect.
This brings us back to baseball and try to make the connection from dimples to seams.
The difference between a 4-seam fastball and a 2-seam fastball is pretty easy to understand. The 4-seam fastball is thrown with an orientation that results in all four seams rotate uniformly into the oncoming air. A 2-seam fastball rotates such that only two of the seams encounter the airflow. This can be seen below.
Left: Four Seam Spin Axis / Right: Two Seam Spin Axis
Similar to the effect that the dimples has on a golf ball, the seams on a baseball create turbulence. With the 4-seam fastball, the seams can effectively grab the air and generate a greater Magnus force. The 2-seam fastball, however, has a large smooth section. This leads to a weaker boundary layer for that section of the ball, and thus a weaker Magnus force.
For a “rising” fastball, this means that the 4-seam grip has more rise (or less drop) than the 2-seam grip. For a 2-seamer or cutter, the effect is a bit more complex. A two-seam gripped “sinker” would have more depth due to the weaker Magnus force, but less lateral movement than the same pitch thrown with a 4-seam grip.
Ultimately it is up to the pitcher to decide which grip optimally fits into their arsenal.
Remember how we mentioned gyrospin above? As it turns out, all spin is not alike and not all spin helps movement. That is to say that it is really impossible to tell how good a pitch is just by the spin rate that TrackMan spits out.
But don’t go throwing out your $30,000 black box just yet.
As described by Dr. Alan Nathan in his article Determining the 3D Spin Axis from TrackMan Data (it’s a very dense read), a baseball has two primary components of spin: transverse spin and parallel spin, or gyrospin.
Dr. Nathan notes that the Magnus force is only sensitive to the transverse spin, which travels perpendicular to the direction of the velocity of the ball (think perfect 4-seam axis). On the other hand, the gyrospin component, spinning like a football or bullet from a rifle, does not contribute to the Magnus force at all. An example of a gyroball is shown below.
To illustrate what this means in a practical sense, let’s look at 2 imaginary pitchers: Pitcher A and Pitcher B. The spin rate and true spin rate (transverse spin rate) are shown in a table below.
Knowing that transverse spin is the only component of spin that affects the Magnus force, we can assume that Pitcher A gets more break on his curveball, despite Pitcher B having a higher spin rate.
So how do we find the transverse spin, if TrackMan only gives us the raw spin rate?
In his paper mentioned above, Dr. Nathan provides some very complicated and complex calculations to calculate the transverse spin based on the velocity data given by TrackMan, but these calculations include a +/- 500 rpm RMS error. This means that these calculated spin rate values have far too much variation to have any real practical value.
Enter Rapsodo.
If you read our previous TrackMan vs Rapsodo validation article, you’ll have some idea of how Rapsodo works, and it’s potential uses going forward. In short, it is portable, smaller, and cheaper than the TrackMan, and has the ability to define the transverse spin axis, what it calls “True Spin.”.
Rapsodo uses optical tracking technology, while TrackMan uses radar, and can see the different axes of spin that a baseball may have. Rapsodo finds these three spin axes relative to the ball and converts them to create true spin, saving us from having to reinvent physics, and providing pitchers with a better tool to more effectively judge their pitches.
The true spin is going to relate highly to how much a pitch actually moves, whereas gyrospin does not affect movement.
Perhaps a pitcher’s slider has a high total spin rate, but spins purely gyroscopically like a washing machine. The spin rate values provided by tools like TrackMan are just not detailed enough to quantify the true value of a pitch. It may work as a general guide but won’t be an accurate measure for movement efficiency. Having a stable spin axis and high useful/true spin are the most vital pieces to a pitcher’s effectiveness.
There is a good amount we have learned about spin rate. We know what effects the spin axes of a ball are, and how, in theory, the pitch should break. We know the difference between a 4-seam thrown pitch and a 2-seam pitch. We know that pitch break is only due to transverse spin, or true spin which is perpendicular the the pitch axis. And with this information we can better inform our pitchers and more effectively help them improve their pitches.
But there is a lot we don’t know. We don’t know how to increase a pitcher’s spin rate. We don’t know what factors change spin rate (besides splitters), be it grip, limb length, hand size, mechanics, etc. We don’t objectively know how to change a pitcher’s spin axis. We have just become able to find the transverse spin axis, but we still don’t know how much a pitch will break given this.
We are, however, not afraid to admit that we don’t know everything. There’s no magic secret to spin rate, and there’s no magic secret to pitching. All we can do is give our athletes the access to the best resources and tools to throw harder and pitch better, while providing them with the best support and information we can offer.

[…] Spin Rate Part II: Spin Axis & Useful Spin […]
Thanks for sharing this work with us.
I have a question for you.
I don’t if in the US you saw the samething but in France ball from left-handed pitcher move more than right handed. For a ball thow by a RHP has a straight trajectory wheras a ball thorw by a LHP has a little bit of down or latelal movement as two-seam Fb even if they throw a for seam.
Do you know why?
Can’t say exactly why but there’s been some evidence of possible genetic differences between left- and right- handed pitchers.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27256719
It very well could be related to that, otherwise we aren’t really sure!
[…] bit of context comes from the concept of useful spin. We report total spin, but that’s just the spin imparted on the ball. Total spin. But spin […]
If the slider spin creates a “dot” when looking from the batter’s view, then it must be “gyro rotation” which has no Magnus effect. I’m confused!
Not perfectly gyro though.  A batters eyes are positioned above the path of a (well positioned) slider.  The batter is looking down slightly toward the oncoming pitch.  So the slider is spinning slightly “tilted” from a gyroscopic spin position and the “dot” which the batter sees is slightly higher up the front of the ball than it would be if spinning gyroscopically.
I want to make sure I understand the slider. An ideal slider would have perfectly horizontal spin diron cation and a completely vertical spin axis, correct?
[…] and what they call “useful” spin – another way to frame spin efficiency – see this article at Driveline Baseball from Michael O’Connell. It goes into great detail about the differences between pitch types […]
So, to simplify this down, if a hitting sees a “dot” on a slider it is less effective (less break) than a more “slurvy” slider.  In other words, you don’t really want sliders with a “dot”.  “Dot” means too much gyroscopic spin.
Not exactly, there are a couple things here.
Seeing a ‘dot’ or not will also depend on the grip so it’s hard to use that as a reliable measure.
If you were designing a pitch in a vacuum then having a gyroscopic slider (lower spin efficiency) would be good. The less/no break comes from the way pitch movement is measured, a hitter will still see the ball move.
Whether a gyroscopic slider is good or not depends on the other pitches you throw and how they fit together. So some athletes may do better with a more slurvy slider and others will do better with a more gyroscopic slider.
Perfectly gyroscopic spin would not produce a “dot.” It would look more like a circle. This is what hitters refer to as the “cement mixer” slider. It does not break, and typically gets hit a long way.
A tighter dot would be an illusion produced by the four seams of the baseball overlapping as they interrupt the area of this circle. Not exactly, but for thought exercise purposes: the tighter the dot, the more transverse spin on the slider.
Take a look at the slider and gyro gifs above, and imagine that everywhere a seam interrupts the surface of the ball gets colored dark. Focusing on the remaining white area will allow you to see the difference between the “dot” slider with useful movement and the “cement mixer” gyro that sits on a tee.
On a four seam Fastball do the seams of horse shoe go towards the pitchers ring finger? Does this affect the movement of the ball?
Jose- Yes, you are right. Typically, pitchers will have the seams towards the ring finger. Switching it around usually does not do much. If anything, it might alter the spin profile (efficiency or rate) but not in a good way.

"Rapsodo, Trackman, and Pitch Tracking Technologies - Where We Stand - Driveline Baseball",2016-11-19T01:03:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/rapsodo-trackman-pitch-tracking-technologies-stand/,"Major League Baseball is now in the Statcast era, where Trackman radar is fully operational across all MLB parks and tracking both pitches and batted balls. This offers several advantages to the previously-existing PITCHf/x and HITf/x systems developed by Sportvision, though the transition is not without a few drawbacks. Still, Trackman is here to stay and pitch tracking is a brand new frontier for front office analysts and academy owners everywhere.
The major drawback behind Trackman is the prohibitively expensive cost (around $30,000 MSRP per public reports; we are not at liberty to disclose the price our radar cost) and the somewhat black-box nature of the device. Rapsodo is a new pitch tracking technology that has been in closed beta testing for over a year, and Driveline Baseball was one of their main partners in helping to develop the blended radar + optical unit along.
The Rapsodo unit sits behind the plate and is well-suited for bullpen work, but unusable during a game. Trackman works in both instances, though it is much tougher to calibrate and maintain than the optical-based Rapsodo. Both units have their pros and cons, but for academy owners, Rapsodo – at 1/10 the cost, around $3,000 MSRP – is a much more attractive option at face value.
However, a real issue with Rapsodo initially in our beta testing was extremely inconsistent tracking of breaking balls. Rapsodo uses the inverse method of Trackman to track baseballs; it measures the spin rate and axis directly of the thrown baseball and derives movement and trajectory from that. Since Rapsodo does not capture the entire flight of the ball, working the trajectory backwards can cause errors. Compare this to Trackman, which has known issues with certain spin axes and pitch types (we’ll get into details later).
Rapsodo delivered their final Release Candidate production unit to us and we decided to do validation testing between the two units across a variety of tests to give facility owners, college coaches, and pro scouts insight on the device.
Disclaimer: Rapsodo has provided us with a free unit in exchange for a year’s worth of beta-testing and feedback. However, they did not request this validation testing and were not provided a copy of this blog post before it went public.
This first test is more of an extension of our last blog post about spin rate, but shows off a major plus of the Trackman radar device – an excellent back-end that generates user-friendly reports. In the last blog post, The Effect of Fastball Backspin Rate on Baseball Hitting Accuracy (Higuchi et. al.) was referenced with this image to show the effect of spin on a pitched baseball:
We simply duplicated this trial using our Rawlings Pro Line Three Wheel Pitching Machine, which can set spin independent of velocity. We fired off a grouped series of pitches at near-identical velocities and initial trajectories but drastically different spin – a medium spin group, a low spin group, and a zero spin group with a 1:00 o’clock spin axis (a typical release slot for a high 3/4 right-handed pitcher).
The results back up the results from the Higuchi et. al. paper, as shown in the charts and strike zone plot below. First up is the Release Slot graph, which shows that the pitching machine had a consistent release point across all the tested pitches:
Next, we have the Pitch Classification report. I tagged medium-spin pitches as Fastballs, low-spin pitches as Sinkers, and no-spin pitches as Knuckleballs. As you can see in the chart, Trackman radar is unable to capture the spin rate of near-zero spin pitches such as the high-speed knuckleball/splitter variants we were throwing. However, all the other metrics stayed relatively constant.
Last is the money chart, which is the Pitch Location chart. Imagining a 1 o’clock release slot for a right-handed pitcher, you can see how the reduction in spin gradually reduces the arrival height across the plate in a predictable diagonal pattern that matches the release slot trajectory. Black dots are medium-spin, red dots are low-spin, and yellow/tan spots are near-zero spin.
This is an extremely easy way to see how varying spin while holding velocity constant can affect the location and movement of a pitch!
In early November, we used an older Rapsodo unit to perform a validation test between Trackman and their unit using two sets of thirty (30) pitches, including fastballs, sliders, and splitters at varying spin rates. The raw data from this test (and others) can be found in our Trackman Pitching Machine Data spreadsheet around rows 54-114 (be careful, it’s a mess in there).
The summary of the test follows:
This test showed that the Rapsodo pitching tracking unit could function as a replacement to the Trackman radar with one major exception and one minor note – the Rapsodo velocity was significantly lower than Trackman and the spin was very slightly slower. The spin as measured by Rapsodo should theoretically be slower since it requires taking pictures of the flight of the ball, and by averaging the spin rate, you have to factor in spin rate decay over the length of the pitch. This is not a major issue and can easily be corrected for if you truly need a Trackman equivalent number. However, velocity discrepancies were an issue that we had not seen in previous testing and caused us to run a second test with the production-quality unit.
On November 17th, we ran another validation test using fastballs and sliders, comparing Rapsodo velocity vs. Stalker Pro 2 Radar velocity (the gold standard for MLB scouts). The results follow:
This showed the final Rapsodo unit and software could very precisely measure the velocity of pitches with no issue.
In testing the Trackman radar with pitchers as well as our Rawlings Pro Line pitching machine, we found that the unit cannot reliably read pitches that fall into two categories:
A video example of both types of pitches can be seen below on our Instagram page – the first two pitches are splitters, the second two pitches are curveballs with true 12-6 spin:
https://www.instagram.com/p/BM8TszDh7vx/
The second category has been a known issue with the radar and inside professional baseball for some time, but the first was a new finding we stumbled across. We decided to put the Rapsodo pitch tracking unit to the test and give it twenty (20) difficult to classify pitches, ten from each category above. Results follow and can also be found on the Trackman Pitching Machine Data spreadsheet in rows #116-135:
Rapsodo captured every single pitch in these two categories with no issue, and the results it returns are believable.
Through the spring of 2016, college coaches and facility owners asked me all over the country about Rapsodo and whether or not it would be a useful tool. I kept saying that there needed to be a lot of improvements made before I could recommend the unit, and that there were a lot of issues. However, the Rapsodo team has made incredible strides over the past year, taking our feedback into account like no other sports technology company has, and delivered a truly impressive unit that is ready to be put into production. Facility owners, college coaches, and pro scouts everywhere should strongly consider buying a Rapsodo pitch tracking unit at the current cost, as I am sure it is likely to increase as more and more validation stories pour in.
It is one thing to have a piece of equipment that functions as advertised – and make no mistake, Rapsodo’s unit delivers here – but it’s another thing entirely to have front-line customer service, technical support, and a tight feedback loop with experts in the industry to create an outstanding experience. Rapsodo manages to do both, which is a rare feat indeed in the baseball industry.
EDIT 11/18: Due to a labeling error in the final graphic, it was corrected (had Trackman labels instead of Rapsodo labels).

Spin Rate: What We Know Now - Driveline Baseball,2016-11-18T03:34:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/11/spin-rate-what-we-know-now/,"This article is intended to build a basis of knowledge of what we, at Driveline Baseball, understand about spin rate at this current time. We will hopefully answer some common questions that we receive and well as link out to resources that we’ve found helpful in understanding spin rate. This article will also be a reference point for some of our further research and writing on spin rate.
We know that we can look at a group of pitchers throwing fastballs at the same speed, say 92 MPH, and those pitchers can all have different rates of spin on their fastballs. The rough guidelines for an ‘average’ pitcher would be a pitch at 92 MPH fastball with a spin rate of 2200 Revolutions per minute (RPM). In reality pitchers can throw 92 and have spin rates ranging from 1800 RPM to 2400 RPMs.
Why this happens can be explained by some simplified physics, in this case we’ll focus on the Magnus force. If we picture a four seam fastball, which is thrown with backspin, the more backspin the less the ball is going to drop over its course from the pitcher’s hand to the catcher’s glove.
Here is a great gif illustrating this effect. This ball is traveling to the left with backspin, meaning the ball is pushing the air downward behind it creating an equal and opposite force upward. So you can see the faster the backspin the faster the air is deflected downwards and the higher the force pushing the ball back upward.
This gif was created from a fantastic video on the Magnus effect from Veritasium titled: What Is The Magnus Force?
So now let’s think of the Magnus force in terms of spin rate.
A 92 MPH fastball at 2200 RPM is going to travel on an ‘average’ path to the plate.
If this 92 MPH fastball is thrown at 1800 RPM that means less spin, less Magnus force meaning the ball will drop further over its course to the plate than the ‘average’ fastball described above.
If this 92 MPH fastball is thrown at 2400 RPM that means more spin, more Magnus force meaning the ball will drop less over its course to the plate the the ‘average’ fastball.
These are small enough differences that a batter would not be able to tell before they decide to swing, but the balls will end up at different heights by the time they reach the plate.
One study has examined how pitches with the same velocity but different spin rates would affect hitters.
This study used a pitching machine to throw pitches at 130 km/hr (80 MPH) at 50 RPS (Red 3000 RPM), 40 RPS (Yellow 2400 RPM), and 30 RPS (Blue 1800). You can see that even at the same speed hitters were consistently under the higher spin fastballs.
From: The Effect of Fastball Backspin Rate on Baseball Hitting Accuracy: Higuchi, et al.
Picture from: Baseball Spin and Pitchers’ Performance: Kanosue, et al. (Open Access)
Now the highest spin fastball is spinning at faster than what we’ve seen in MLB pitchers, but the point still stands. Baseball is a game of millimeters when it comes to making or preventing good contact. So when you can throw fastballs with spin that are further away from average, the more beneficial it can be.
This would be in line with what Zach Day examined in 2013 finding that higher spin fastballs had more swing and misses and fewer ground balls. Lower spin fastballs  the reverse, less swing and misses and more ground balls.
So we can say that at the same velocity the higher the spin rate the more swing and misses the fastball is going to get.
This chart from Jeff Zimmerman also supports this idea , finding that when looking at fastballs at the same velocity the higher the spin rate the higher the percentage of swinging strikes.
Jeff Long recently examined the correlations between spin rate and swinging strike%, GB%, and FB% and only found very small relationships with regards to spin when looking at all pitches. In this instance the effects of high and low spin rate most likely equaled themselves out.
Higher spin – not necessarily. Lower spin – maybe.
With the knowledge that splitters have a noticeably lower spin rate than fastballs, we can assume that the splitter grip (where the index and middle fingers are very spread out on the ball) leads to a decrease in spin rate. Although we have not officially examined this theory, our preliminary testing agrees that an increased spacing between the fingers on the ball leads to a decrease in spin rate.
Beyond that, nobody truly knows how to reliably and consistently change the spin rate of pitchers. Mostly because no one knows why the ball spins differently from pitcher to pitcher.
What we do know if that there is good evidence that spin rate is created in an incredibly short amount of time.
From: Baseball Spin and Pitchers Performance: Kanosue et al. (Open Access)
Here the authors present picture evidence that suggests how quickly the ball goes from not rotating to rotating when a pitcher throws. Considering the acceleration phase of the throw lasts anywhere from 30-50 ms the suggestion that spin may be generated in only 6 ms(or just longer than that) of the motion is incredible. Each picture frame above is 6 ms long, you can see the ball goes from not rotating to rotating and being released in nearly one frame.
We do have some evidence that spin rate is an innate characteristic, and is linearly related with velocity. We had 6 pitchers throw 20 pitches at velocities from 60-80 MPH. The pitchers were told to use the same fastball grip with the same mechanics and attempt to throw a fastball starting at 60 MPH followed by a pitch at 61 MPH all the way up to 80 MPH. The R^2 values between velocity and spin rate of the first 5 pitchers ranged from  0.83-0.96 which is quite a high relationship!
You can find the data here.
The 6th pitcher threw pitches from 60 – 80 MPH but was told to attempt to change his mechanics from pitch to pitch and you can see that the R^2 relationship dropped down to .541. Though this is merely a starting point for more research we can reasonably say that spin rate is an innate characteristic but unknown mechanical changes may also affect spin rate.
So this data suggests that we can say there is an innate relationship between spin rate and velocity for an individual pitcher but not across a large population of pitchers.
Meaning that if one pitcher could throw harder under the same mechanics and same grip his spin rate should increase. But his spin rate could ‘max out’ at 1900 at 92 MPH. While another pitcher may be able to throw harder under the same mechanics and same grip but his spin increase to 2400 at 92 MPH. This is obviously taking into considering a large assumption that they could throw harder with the same mechanics.
So pitchers may be able to increase their velocity and spin rate but we don’t know where they will end up on the scale of 1800 – 2400 RPM for fastballs. Not every pitcher throwing 98+ has a ridiculous high spin rate. Just like not every pitcher throwing 90 has a low spin rate.
In order to better compare spin rates at different velocities between pitchers we created Spin to Velocity Ratio (SVR).
SVR = Spin Rate (RPM)/Velocity (MPH)
This enables us to normalize the spin per the velocity of the pitch. If a pitcher is spinning a fastball at 2400 RPM, that is less impressive at 99 MPH and much more impressive at 89 MPH. Making spin rate more useful over a wide range of pitchers of varying velocities.
To more effectively compare SVR of varying pitchers, we can normalized SVR into a new unit, called SVR+, which accounts for the league average SVR of pitchers.
SVR+ = (Player SVR/League Average SVR)*100
This gives you an idea of how much high or lower a pitcher’s spin is vs. Major League average, where a SVR+ of 100 is perfectly average. A SVR+ of greater than 100 would indicate a higher than average spin rate fastball, where as a SVR+ of less than 100 would be a lower than average spin rate fastball.
Unfortunately, MLB and other statistic collecting agencies have yet to recognize our pioneering efforts into the field of baseball statistics.
This was also discussed on Statcast’s 8/26/16 Podcast: The Art of Spin Rate
No, not that we can tell.
Though there is a growing belief that drastic changes in spin rate (usually sharp decreases) can be a sign of an injury or pending injury.
Each pitcher is going to have a small range around their average spin rate. Sharp changes from that normal range can be seen as an early sign of unhealthy fatigue. So teams can monitor their pitchers spin rate to see if there are any sustained drops of spin rate from their average. This would also work hand in hand with monitoring a pitcher’s velocity.
Now this method of injury prevention hasn’t been proven to be predictive over a large group of pitchers but it’s simply another variable for teams to watch. Obviously at this time these types of analysis are only able to be done with MLB/MiLB pitchers.
This idea was also explained further in these Fangraphs pieces: A New Way to Study Pitching Injury and Pitcher Spin Rates and Injuries.
For pitchers that come to our facility we can use either Trackman or Rapsodo to get measurements of their spin rates and then make recommendations on how to best use their pitchers or make tweaks to improve their pitches. In the case of fastballs, again we don’t know how to change spin rate, but we can make recommendations on how to sequence pitches or location preferences.
An example would be a pitcher with a high spin fastball consistently being told to throw fastball at a hitters knees. In this case his fastballs aren’t going to drop as much compared to the ‘average’ fastball meaning he might have a higher chance of getting hit being down in the zone. Pitching middle/up in the zone may be more beneficial in hopes of inducing pop-ups and swinging strikes.
The reverse is true for pitchers who have low spin fastballs. Staying down in the zone would be the best option because hitters should swing just over the pitch resulting in more ground balls. If someone if sitting right in the average range then we move on to looking at the other pitches he throws. Because we want pitches that are further away from the ‘average’ spin.
Hopefully this answers some basic questions on what we know about spin rate right now, we look forward to continuing our research with Trackman and Rapsodo.

“Bauer Unit???”, let’s toss years of aerodynamic research in the trash.  I get it Baseball writers want to make it simple. But if you divide your Bauer unit by 120, you essentially have the unitless tangential velocity (radius * spin rate) divided by forward velocity. This typically is denoted, S, on lift coefficient versus S plots. The plots of Sikorsky, Watts, Alaways (yes, me), etc.  Yes 2400 rpm at 100 mph becomes a little “harder” to calculate, instead of 24 nonsense units, you get 24/120 = 0.2. I get it, 24 is easier to conceptualize than 0.2 or 20 cents. But if you tell me the spin parameter as I called it, was 0.2, I could tell you the lift coefficient was roughly 0.2. Max lateral deviation was 24 inches (more likely 18 inches.).
Instead of dividing by 120, divide by 12. Still makes more sense. It would be 10 times the unit less spin parameter but at list the guys who did the ground breaking work wouldn’t cringe as much.
Thanks for the feedback, and understand your concern. Our blog posts are designed to accommodate coaches, players, and fans of a wide variety of technical backgrounds. Some posts are more technical by nature; however, others – such as this post – are written as introductory pieces to more complex topics. As you mentioned, Bauer Units were created to a) simplify the relationship between spin and velocity during ball flight b) simplify a pitcher’s ability to generate spin at a given intent level. Given that a Bauer Unit does a fairly decent job of capturing what it sets out to do, we feel that the unit does serve a purpose in the baseball community and acknowledge that it isn’t for everyone.
Hope this makes sense, and appreciate the work you’ve done in the past.

A Pitcher's Long-Term Velocity Development: The Herbie Good Story - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-22T04:33:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/long-term-velocity-development-herbie-good/,"What follows is a deep look into the training history of Herbie Good, who built himself from a 15U player pulling down in the low-70s into a 19-year-old pitching at 91-93 T95.
In many respects, the story of Herbie mirrors Driveline’s own, and he has been a participant in the many iterations of throwing programs we have been testing since 2012.
Why did Herbie start training at Driveline? A coach told him to quit baseball.
At 15, Herbie was well on his way out of baseball. He was not a big, tooled-out prospect who was sure to grow into his velocity, given time.
He ran a 60-yard dash in 10 flat. Yes, 10.
This was the last push to acquire good baseball skills before I had to hang it up. Driveline was different than anything I had ever tried and I decided to give it a shot.
So, out of options and with the support of his family, Herbie started training.
From a training stand-point, Herbie had huge hurdles to overcome on the strength and coordination fronts. Tall athletes generally present coordination challenges. Doing Herbie’s initial assessment, the two most glaring issues were major general strength deficits and a throwing pattern that did not incorporate his lower half.
Herbie is proof positive that you do not need an “optimal” training program at a young training age. Herbie started in 2012. The Driveline Pitching Program looks significantly different than it did then.  In 2012, a significant portion of Herbie’s training included weighted ball holds, heavy bag work, 5+ days of heavy lifting and plenty of other drills and modalities that we have not found to be as effective as what we use today.
But the intent was always there. And that is what truly mattered.
What do I wish every 15-year-old in America knew about pitching? How to train and pitch with intent.
Below is a video of Herbie’s drill progressions over the last 4 years.
Over 5 years, Herbie trained at 3 different facilities, following us from place to place as our business grew. He trained on his own.
The reality is: our pitching program in 2016 is significantly better than it was in 2013. Yet, still Herbie was able to gain velocity over 26 weeks doing “non-optimized” programming. We wrote up his story (as unnamed athlete “Ezekial”).
Why? Because doing a “non-optimized” program at 100% effort will always trump the results generated by half-assing a “100%-optimized” program, if such a thing exists (it doesn’t).
Simultaneously, Herbie was working on improving the way that he moved. Below is a comparison of pivot pickoffs approximately 16 months apart.
Pivot Pickoffs: August, 2013
Pivot Pickoffs: February, 2014
Long-levered athletes have severe coordination issues (especially at a young age) that skill-specific overload training can help clean up.
Herbie absolutely killed pivot pickoffs in an attempt to improve and then internalize a natural arm path. It took 16-18 months to fully groove. And, to this day, still needs to be challenged in order to maintain it.
Such is the plight of being tall, young and uncoordinated.
Many coaches (and many athletes) do not have the ability to look at athlete development over that long of a time-frame.
Teams need to win now. Athletes want “easy”, “guaranteed” velocity.
For natural athletes who are high-responders to training, playing games, doing something on the training front, and letting physical maturity take care of itself can be a viable path to developing an athlete.
Non-athletes or athletes whose development curve has started to underperform their peers (i.e. you aren’t as good as you used to be) need a longer time horizon, less competition, and more focus on general and sport-specific training and fitness.
For many athletes, success is a number you’ve been dreaming about since you were a young kid watching big league games.
I first thought I could get drafted when I hit 90mph on a pulldown (at 16).
The letdown that happens after you reach that first milestone can create a letdown effect for athletes. Pulling down 90 MPH at 16 means that you are an elite thrower for your age, but it is not elite for the world population. Ultimately, to reach goals of playing baseball at the highest levels, you’ll need to be world-class.
What matters is how you respond to your first taste of success.
Athletes much more gifted than Herbie have come through our facility, hit 90mph (off the mound), gotten a 50% ride to a mid-major D1 school….and done nothing.
Once you hit a number, you always expect it will stick. But that simply isn’t true. The body is a complex system and, to make your velocity stick–let alone improve, you often have to abandon old training habits in search of new stimuli.
That is why environment matters.
Kyle continually encouraged me to keep throwing. So I did.
Who you surround yourself with matters. There is no better training environment than being the second- or third-best guy in the group. You always have a rabbit to chase. For 16-year-old Herbie, he had reached a goal, but had a group of guys in the early days of Driveline who were still better than he was.
He just had to keep working.
In Herbie’s case, doing this work was compounded by an injury.
Diving for a ball at first base, he hyperextended his arm and suffered an avulsion fracture in his pitching elbow and had to sit out his junior year of school.
He had surgery and started the rehab process. Playing catch early in that process was hard. He either had days where he felt great and wanted to throw harder than the prescribed effort, needing to be deliberately dialed back. Or had days where it was difficult to even pick up a ball.
For someone who had spent his last 18 months in the gym, training his heart out to play ball in college, sitting around was excruciating.
What did he learn from that experience?
Don’t take the ability to throw a baseball, or the ability to train for granted.
And while training intent is what got him to throwing 90mph in the first place, when he finished his rehab process, that intent was gone.
The most difficult part of the rehab process was being able to maximize intent again.
Again, environment played a large role. At 17, injured and nervous that you will ever get back what you had trained so hard to achieve, it is natural to back off wanting to protect yourself.
However, showing up to the facility every day, Herbie trained alongside older athletes with longer injury histories who served as both role models and rabbits to chase.
Plus, as the gym grew, more and more athletes were showing up. It wasn’t just Herbie, Kyle and a handful of the same athletes week after week.
New athletes meant more guys to compare himself too–and even more reason to keep pushing. His programming changed, focused less on maximal strength gains and more on coordination and speed.
Over the long-term, novelty in programming and environment plays a big role in facilitating adaptation in athletes.
And the intent did come back. Culminating in a 92-94mph indoor pen before draft day.
Herbie was drafted in the 36th round. And his story shows what can be accomplished by looking at athlete development over extremely long time periods.
To reach his next goal of playing professionally, Herbie still needs work. What he accomplished in 5 years is remarkable from mid-70s max effort running throw to 91-94 mph off the mound. But it isn’t the end.
Like he discovered at 16 when he threw 90mph, whether he reaches the next level as a pitcher is completely in his hands.
Way to go Herbie, Great story and I proud to admit that I really dig the circa 1991 John Daly mullet
What type of surface and drill was used to capture the mph each week? I.e flat ground, off mound…drill-pivot pickoff, rocker, walking wind up, run n gun?

Pitching Velocity and its Effect on UCL Stress Using the PULSE Sleeve - Driveline Baseball,2016-07-28T06:46:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/07/pitching-velocity-and-its-effect-on-ucl-stress-using-pulse/,"This is a guest post by Dr. Mike Sonne that was republished from his website. Dr. Sonne has a PhD in biomechanics from McMaster University in Hamilton, where he studied muscle fatigue and how it influences performance.
The dudes over at Driveline gave us scientists the best present we could ever hope for – data.
Up here in Toronto, you can’t go five minutes into a Blue Jays conversation without hearing about the dilemma the team faces regarding Aaron Sanchez. The young ace Sanchez, is without a doubt, the best pitcher on the team, and arguably one of the top five starting pitchers in the American League this season. Last year the Jays spent a ton of prospect capital to go out and get an ace in the trade market – this year, they’re talking about moving the Ace they already have into the bullpen.
I’m not convinced that this is going to work to reduce stress on Aaron’s arm. Will he throw fewer innings? For sure – but as I’ve tried to demonstrate – fatigue accumulation in the arm doesn’t necessarily depend on the number of innings you pitch, but more on the number of pitches you throw in an inning. Sanchez has been known to dial up his fastball to 100mph out of the bullpen, and this left me asking the question – despite limiting his innings, is Aaron Sanchez going to be exposing his arm to more stress by throwing out of the pen? Let’s look at the driveline data to see if we can figure this out.
In the Driveline study, five pitchers threw 20 pitches each. Some had Powerguard on, some didn’t – but for the sake of this study, I’m going to ignore that factor (they didn’t find there was a reduction in stress, anyway). First, I looked at the relationship between stress and the other variables that came out of the PULSEthrow Sensor. There was an R2 of 0.84 between pitch velocity and elbow stress – that means, 84% of the stress on the UCL can be accounted for by the velocity of the pitch. If someone throws harder – they’re going to have more elbow torque, and greater UCL stress. The rest of the variables – they get a bit hazier.
We found a different relationship between velocity and stress when looking at PULSE data off the mound
Arm speed has an inverse relationship with elbow torque. Greater arm speeds appear to have less UCL stress, but arm speed only accounts for 25.5% of the variance in UCL stress (an R2 of 0.25). Arm slot accounted for none of the variance in UCL stress (so no fancy graph for this one). Finally, shoulder rotation angle accounted for 34.8% of the variance in UCL Stress. I’m not entirely sure what “shoulder rotation angle” is defining here, so I’m just going to leave it for now. Essentially, with a greater shoulder rotation angle, there is greater UCL stress.
The idea that UCL injuries are more prevalent in higher velocity pitchers is not a new one (Keller et al., 2016). Researchers from the University of Michigan found that one of the most significant predictors for elbow injury was ball speed (Whiteside et al., 2016). However, how does a change in ball speed influence UCL stress?
I used the driveline data, and I rank ordered UCL stress, and Velocity. So – there is a 1 through 20 for Velocity and Stress – which I’ll refer to as individual velocity and individual stress. I then ran a Spearman’s correlation on these data.
There was an R2 of 0.17 – essentially stating that an internal increase of velocity is associated with 17% of the increase in UCL stress. As you can see in this graph, this is not the strongest of relationships. Does a pitcher ramping up and throwing harder, within his own capacities increase stress on the arm? Possibly, but I don’t think it’s that clear.
There are a lot of other factors that go into determining how stress may change between the role of a starter and a reliever. Particularly, relievers (and relievers in the proposed role that Sanchez will fill) will be coming in for high leverage situations. Working in such a stressful situation can change kinematics, as Bill Marras’ group found when exposing those who were lifting boxes to highly stressful work environments (Marras et al., 2000). When preventing injury, recovery is one of the most important aspects of health. Relief pitchers can perform on up to three consecutive days – and while pitching only 1 inning at a time (in most cases), they still need to perform warm up pitches. Their workload is definitely different than a starter’s, but I don’t think there is enough evidence out there to support that switching from a starting role to a reliever’s role is that much of a reduction in demands on the arm.
The Blue Jays hired a high performance team to help make scientific decisions when it comes to things like monitoring a pitcher’s workload. They have a really hard decision ahead of them, and the long term health of Aaron Sanchez depends on them making the right choices.

Return to Throwing Program,2015-09-30T14:05:37+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/10/casey-weathers-the-importance-of-arm-health/,"The traditional model for phases of rehab that occur after Tommy John surgery look something like this:
This blog will focus on improvements that can be made in a return to throwing program.
ThiThis blog was updated on 6/3/2022 and was written by Dean Jackson and Kyle Lindley, edited by Michael O’Connell
Below is an example of what an Interval Throwing Program may look like.
It’s our opinion at Driveline Baseball that this type of program has three major flaws:
Let’s break them down:
Your first day throwing on this program involves two sets of “warm-up throws” and 50 total throws from 45 feet. If you split the difference on the warm-up throws and call it 15 throws each (10-20 per the document), then you are making 80 total throws on your first post-surgery throwing day!
The most common side effect of these types of programs involves soreness and setbacks due to the inability to overcome the volume of the program. This can create a vicious cycle of starting, stopping, and restarting a throwing program.
Our article detailing “pulldown” throws goes into a bit of detail, but players need to be tested at game-like intensities before they return to competition. We need to make sure that they are occurring at the appropriate time
Secondly, there is no monitoring outside of distance. Pitchers going out to 180 feet on this program do so at varying angles, velocities, and intent. Throwing at 40 mph or 60 mph at 60 feet should not be equal.
This program cannot be equally effective for the MLB pitcher who sits 95 MPH and the 17-year-old who sits 83 MPH. Other than different starting points, there are drastically different resources available to one over another.
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) also has its flaws as a measure of intensity.
Previous research has shown that the percentage of effort that a pitcher is trying to throw at does not correlate strongly with how hard the pitcher is throwing compared to their velocity peak (Slenker, Limpisvasti, et al. – Biomechanical comparison of the interval throwing program and baseball pitching: upper extremity loads in training and rehabilitation AJSM May 2014).
At 60% of perceived effort, pitchers were generating forces of 76% and ball speeds approaching 84% of maximum intensity.
Pitchers are really bad at estimating how much effort they are expending and consistently underestimate it. This should have profound implications for rehabilitation programs.
Programs are often written in a way that doesn’t account for the rest of a player’s life.
Some baseball players returning from surgery have a nice, smooth recovery process. Others do not. Some players’ bodies won’t let them progress for a few weeks. Other athletes feel incredible, and they feel ahead of schedule. It’s a rollercoaster to try and help a player along with  Physical Therapists and surgeons.
They are difficult to adjust in all areas because everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Everyone recovers and adapts at different rates.
Because of this, there will often be some sort of setback due to throwing volume and intensity. After all, everyone will respond differently to a program. But we need to remember that other factors outside of the throwing program can also cause setbacks. Lack of sleep, varying nutrition, school load, or travel are a few reasons that can also cause setbacks.
The fact of the matter is tools exist today that can raise the standards of Tommy John rehab. We want a standardized approach but an individualized method.
The solution is to use technology to better track progress and make programs individualized. This means utilizing
Combined with subjective measures, these objective measures give us the best chance for the next revolution of rehab programs.
Using Pulse and a radar gun, we can monitor the following variables:
You can read more about the metrics on Pulse here.
We can use those to better supplement subjective measures by asking the athlete questions such as:
We can combine these to create the four main phases of our return to throwing program:
We can layer on more extensive monitoring with Pulse and Radar Gun inside these phases.
Arm Speed will be used as our primary monitoring tool until ~700 RPM Arm Speed. Reaching ~700 Arm Speed typically occurs after several weeks of throwing.
Once ~700 RPM arm speed is reached, we would switch to a combination of arm speed and throwing velocity. Arm speed and velocity would be used to continue progressing intensity through the remainder of the rehab. We choose ~700 RPM Arm Speed because that is approximately where Pulse Arm Speed starts to deviate from throwing velocity.
We would progress intensity using object data (arm speed and throwing velocity) and subjective data from that point on. Focusing on how he felt he was recovering, how his mechanics looked like his, and how his body responded well to the increased intensity.
The example below is from a return to throwing program with athlete Ryan Cloude. This example represents a sample of what can be done with a data-driven return to throwing program. The advice dispensed in this article would certainly not work for everyone for the reasons stated above. We know how weighted balls affect the torque on the arm and workload, the example program below only used baseballs.
Ryan Cloude is a 21-year-old collegiate pitcher. He has an interesting training history, having increased his pitching velocity from 83mph as a college freshman to topping at 95mph as a junior. In the middle of his junior season, he tore his UCL and required UCL reconstruction.
The goal of this phase was to build a throwing volume base at a low intensity. We start all our athletes off with a low threshold to set them up for increased intensity later.
Ryan threw 3x per week during this 4-week phase. We monitored Arm Speed with Pulse, gradually increasing from a one-session average of ~200 RPM and top 1/8th ~250 RPM to a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM.
Total throws per session increased from 25 to 90 from the beginning to the last day of the phase.
We built this phase of the throwing volume base established in Phase 1 by increasing the throwing intensity on Monday and Friday each week.
Once Ryan hit the ~700 RPM arm speed mark, we switched measuring intensity from Arm Speed to throwing velocity.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~350 RPM and top 1/8th ~450 RPM to a one-session average of ~600 RPM and top 1/8th ~850 RPM. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 49.9 mph and top 1/8th 57.6 mph to a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th 76.0 mph.
Instead of throw counts, Ryan was given options between 60-90 throws on the higher intensity days. At the same time, lower intensity days progressed gradually from 90 to 120 throws. He did the max number of throws most days, except for three days where the daily notes had some variation of “another crazy conditioning at 6 am this morning, body felt dead. Stopped at 60 throws”—no arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
One week, the same intensity was repeated (instead of progressing it) because Ryan was exhausted from team conditioning and didn’t want to push it.
Return to throwing templates lack guidelines on how to make adjustments to the program. At times the adjustment doesn’t need to be because something went wrong with the throwing program. But other parts of a player’s life are still ongoing when rehabbing a throwing injury. Tracking these programs leaves a player and a coach in a much better place to make an appropriate adjustment.
The only difference between the schedule of this phase and the last is that instead of the weeks going HLH, HLH (higher intensity, low, higher, and repeat), they went HLH, LHL (higher intensity, low, repeat). This shifted Ryan from 4 higher intensity throwing days every two weeks to 3 high-intensity throwing days every two weeks.
There were two new additions in phase three. First, bullpens at lower intensity began in this phase. Second, we started to focus more on moving efficiently. We measure movement efficiency by throwing the prescribed velocity with the lowest possible arm speed.
Over six weeks, Ryan’s Arm Speed increased from a one-session average of ~600 and top 1/8th of ~850 to a one-session average of ~700 and top 1/8th of ~ 925. His velocity increased from a one-session average of 62.6 mph and top 1/8th of 76.0 mph to a one-session average of 69.6 mph and top 1/8th of 89.4 mph.
His volume options remained 60-90 on higher intensity days and 90-120 on lower intensity days. Ryan decided not to throw the max amount of throws on a given day: total body soreness from training with his team and getting kicked out of the gym as it was closing. No arm-related reasons for throwing less than the max throws.
Bullpen throwing velocity was dropped back to the high 70s, with two pens being thrown each week, and lower intensity days were added over a couple of weeks until Ryan was throwing five days a week.
Throwing velocity on main bullpen days gradually increased from a one-session average of 64.5 mph and top 1/8th of 77.4 mph to a one-session average of 74.2 and top 1/8th 90.9 mph.
We had phases that we wanted to progress through and a good idea how roughly how much we should progress over a certain period, but ultimately we let Ryan’s body decide if it was ready to progress or not.
If the prescribed intensity for a session wasn’t comfortable, we would not progress intensity in the next session (regardless of what the program template said). We would repeat the intensity (or reduce it) until it was comfortable. The main idea in the intensity prescribing process was “letting the door be opened” when Ryan’s body was ready and not trying to “kick the door down” and force a more intense stimulus on his arm before it was ready.
Other pitch types were added first to recovery days during this phase. Simply by throwing offspeed in flat ground or catch play/long toss work. Intensity and volume were gradually increased until Ryan was throwing at maximum intensity on the mound.
Volume options for total throws on each bullpen day gradually increased from 60-90 to 90-110, while volume options for lower intensity days stayed 90-120. Once Ryan’s velocity got back into the high 80’s a few bullpens turned into recovery days because he didn’t feel fully recovered.
The first live session versus hitters happened roughly 10.5 months post-op and went well enough that Ryan decided he was ready to face hitters in a game that counted for his team. The first outing versus hitters in a real game happened just before the 11-month post-op mark and resulted in 1IP 0H 0BB 3K.
After completing his return to play, Ryan reflected on the process as a whole:
“Having objective data to show my progress was massive for my mental state. On days where I wasn’t able to hit my goal or days where I felt I was so far away from being healthy, I’d be able to look back and see how much harder I was throwing and how much more arm speed I was able to handle.”
It’s widespread to hear athletes talk about the mental toll injuries took on them and how grueling the whole experience is. I believe collecting data to give athletes a good idea of where they are now, where they have been, and where they need to go can significantly improve how comfortable their experience with rehab ends up being.
Ryan also said:
“(I) loved having a progression based on how I was recovering and not a cookie-cutter program that’s the same for everyone.”
We’re attacking it via our integrated staff training methods, technology, and Driveline TRAQ – and results have never been better, both on the performance AND rehab sides.

Uncommitted to Drafted: Christian Meister's Year of Training,2015-09-05T10:13:43+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/09/uncommitted-to-drafted-christian-meisters-year-pitching-training/,"Summary
In the 2015 MLB Draft, Christian Meister was drafted in the 29th round out of “No School.” He was signed because he showcased good velocity with command despite graduating from a junior college and not having a team to play for during the 2015 season.
During his pitching training at Driveline, Meister increased his mound velocity from 87 mph to 92-93 mph, hitting 95 mph, and improved his command of all pitches.  Meister’s story provides insight into building a foundation for elite pitching velocity and command, starting with the most important tool of all: learning how to work.
Christian Signs His Contract along with Kyle and Matt
Getting Started: An Uninspired Approach
When he started with us at Driveline, he’d just seen his aspirations of playing college baseball go up in smoke.  He wanted to play in the majors, and the standard path – junior college to college program to drafted – was seemingly closed to him.
“I had nothing to lose.  That was my mentality.  Everything to gain, nothing to lose.  I saw the results from other guys – they spoke for themselves.  I thought – why not me?”
Meister recounts his first experience with Driveline, after being introduced to us through his friend and teammate.
“I was interested.  I’d heard about weighted ball programs in the past, and I’m always looking to get better.  I really liked what they were about, and I trained there for a couple weeks without anything formal.  I decided to stick with it and go there full-time – I knew that where I was at wasn’t where I wanted to be.”
Still, even with that decision in mind, Christian’s training intensity was inconsistent and both trainers and athletes noticed a curious propensity to skip throwing recovery and high utilization rate of the Smith machine for lifting.
Learning to Work: How Mindset and Environment Impact Training Results
As the summer and fall turned to winter and Christian still was without a school to play for in 2015, he made the mental shift to fully commit to the program.
“For the first couple months, I was kind of blindly doing things, and then I started to see that if I was going to do it, I needed to do it 100% every day.  I saw other guys, how hard they were working – one of the guys that I worked with was Casey Weathers, who’s in AA for the Indians, and I worked with him for six months.  He’s an older guy, and he’s probably one of the hardest workers I’ve ever seen in my life.  Every day, in all aspects – weighted baseballs, lifting – he’s extremely strong and fit.  It’s cool to have a guy that can push you like that.  Like, I’m throwing 5 oz. baseballs as hard as he’s throwing 7 oz. baseballs.  It makes me want to get better.  That was a great training tool to have.”
Casey and Christian throwing weighted balls (Oct ’14). He barely scrapes 96 mph and it’s a good day. In February, he will have a day where no ball is under 96 mph and be upset about it.
Those trainees, and the environment they create, are essential.  For a significant time during Meister’s training with us, he did the workouts, but was not fully invested mentally.  It was a shift that the training staff noticed.
“He knew what to do, but he hadn’t committed his heart to executing it.
“Sometime during the fall, Ben Brewster [now with the White Sox organization], an intern with us at the time, took Meister aside and showed him how to lift – not just the mechanics of it, but the mentality, and the importance of following through on recovery.  Brewster held him accountable for his training – and that kind of accountability can be everything.”
-Mike
“Our athletes are some of the best teachers we have. Who am I to say ‘show up five days a week?’  He’s employing me.  If you pay someone to yell at you, eventually you’ll see it’s ridiculous because you have the power to make them stop.  To me, it has to come from peer pressure.  That’s why we’re protective of who we have.”
-Kyle
It’s this culture that is the most important part of our facility.  Meister being around professional pitchers who would hold him accountable for his own training is what makes a good working environment.
Getting to the Next Level: Training at 100% when you have 80% to give
Meister saw immediate gains from the training, but, inevitably, he hit a plateau.
“It’s different for everyone.  It depends on your mechanics, work ethic, natural ability.  I saw a pretty quick jump initially, [but] there are ups and downs, too.  The guys at Driveline, they’re very in tune with that.  They’ve seen it before.  No one goes straight up.  I think it speaks to baseball, really.  It’s a game of failure, and how you deal with that. It’s not about the week to week gains as much as it is the overall, ‘where I’m going to be in six months, a year.’”
After the mindset switch. Not all days are great days. But there is a major cumulative training effect.
The velocity charts for Meister tell this tale in remarkable clarity.  You can almost draw a line, in the fall, where he just decided ‘I’m going to do this’, where he legitimately taught himself how to work hard.  But without that commitment, there’s no way he gets drafted.
Once that mentality shift happened, Meister started facing a new challenge: the fact that training at that level means you’re rarely working with a full tank of gas.
“Plenty of times my arm wasn’t feeling good, but you have to go with as much effort as you can.  One of the terms we use – ‘if you’ve only got 80% today, give 100% of it.’  Making sure you’re always going as hard as you can, regardless of how much you’ve got that particular day.  It’s always going to be different.  You’re rarely at 100%.”

Sustaining High Output for the Long Run: Training as an Identity
And, expanding on that, Meister had a takeaway of his own from his experience at Driveline:
“What it means to put in damn near close to 100% every day for a long period of time.  Growing up a little bit.  It was huge.  Obviously physical development, but mental as well.  You’re not always going to have your best stuff, and how you deal with it, how you prepare, that’s huge.”
Preparation is an important word for us to highlight, here.  Both because it was the missing element before Meister committed to the program (he would often do workouts, but skip recovery) and because it was a huge mental edge to have once he did.
“When I know that I’ve prepared the best I can, there’s no doubt in my mind when I go out there.  When I step on that mound, I know that I didn’t leave anything to doubt.  There’s no regrets.  I think it’s a huge mental edge to have.  Then you just attack, and you can feel good at the end of the day regardless of the results, and if you’ve worked hard usually the results will be in your favor.”
Meister had his own take on his biggest lesson from his time at Driveline:
“The work ethic, learning how to work.  Dealing with how I’m feeling – how my arm’s feeling – on a day-to-day basis.  That’s the nice thing about being in the Indians organization.  They’re the most progressive as far as pitchers and throwing programs.  We’re allowed to long toss, we’re allowed to do whatever it is we need to do that makes us successful.   That’s key for me, because I came from Driveline, which is a unique program – most of the other organizations I wouldn’t be able to do that, to continue it.  That’s huge.”
Work ethic, in our minds, doesn’t simply equate to doing hard work.  It’s a phrase that’s hard to pin down, but, as evidenced by Meister’s development, it can sometimes just be as simple as showing up.  “If training is work to you, you shouldn’t do it,” says Boddy.  “So much of professional baseball is harder than that.  If the preparation isn’t your passion, then it’s not really your thing.  Work ethic is the ability to work at a menial job and then show up at Driveline with the correct attitude.”
What Lies Ahead: One Goal Down, One Very Far Away
While Christian has achieved one goal, he is still very far away from his primary one: pitching in the Major Leagues. While he has learned what it takes, that doesn’t mean that he will have what it takes. But continuous improvement can help him build upon this success.
The kind of preparation Meister talked about, the kind of intense, focused effort that can consume one’s day-to-day life, seemingly leaves little room for the big picture.  But, as Meister points out, having a long-term goal is essential.  And having that goal doesn’t have to be a distraction.
“Absolutely.  One of my philosophies of life is to have a long-term goal, a big goal, and then set a bunch of short-term goals and then check those off.  The ultimate goal is to make it to the big leagues and stay there.  Short term, continue to train, get better every single day.  It’s as simple as that.  If you take care of the little things, then the big thing is going to take care of itself.”
In the end, Meister’s passion for the game shone through – and it’s not a coincidence.
“You have to do so many things in life that you don’t like. If baseball is one of them, don’t do it.”

Post-Activation Potentiation with Weighted Baseballs,2014-09-29T12:51:35+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/09/post-activation-potentiation-weighted-baseballs/,"Post-Activation Potentiation (PAP) is a controversial topic in exercise science, with research pointing in favor and against it working. PAP is not easy to describe, but the simplest way to put it is to think about testing your 60-yd dash time shortly after squatting 3-5 reps of heavy weight. The idea is that by “potentiating” the central nervous system (CNS) using heavy movements, performance increases in subsequent lighter and explosive movements.
First and foremost, it’s important to note that the most popular method of PAP in baseball does NOT work – using a donut or weighted bat sleeve in the on-deck circle before going up to hit.
Dr. Coop DeRenne, a legend in the world of baseball performance science, studied this very phenomenon years ago. Donuts used prior to swinging a real bat show a marked decrease in bat speed, yet hitters use them all the time. The reason for this isn’t because athletes are smarter or more experienced than sports scientists running controlled experiments, of course, it’s just a mix of inertia, superstition, and fear.
Or you could ask the scholarly people in the comments of major news sites, who have stunning results to share with us all:
Thanks, Doctor.
The reason that PAP doesn’t work in the on-deck circle is because the use of the donut in an attempt to increase the bat weight makes no effort to grasp the significantly changed biomechanics of the swing by adding 200% or more of the weight to the bat in an uneven distribution. This makes the loaded donut swing a completely different motor pattern by drastically changing not only the mass of the bat, but the moment of inertia (MOI) of the bat as well.
In short, it doesn’t work. So if you use donuts in the on-deck circle (or at all, really), you should stop.
Ah, this is the million dollar question, isn’t it? What about throwing weighted baseballs prior to pitching to potentiate the CNS to increase output?
I think this is a rather fascinating concept, and as it so happens, we’ve studied this effect as best we can in the Driveline Sports Science lab. There are three generally-accepted methods of how PAP works, and the primary one we focused on was the idea that increased recruitment of higher order motor units would activate other motor units to allow for greater than average neuromuscular performance.
Study
Have athletes test run-and-gun velocities with a standard (5 oz) ball after a dynamic warm-up, then throw 6 oz and 7 oz overload balls for 3-5 reps each. After that, test run-and-gun velocities with the standard (5 oz) ball again and see if there are significant changes.
We also tested the OPPOSITE effect – we had athletes throw underload baseballs instead of overload to see if activation might work in a different manner.
Results
We split the athletes into two even groups as randomly as possible while controlling for age and skill level.
First we’ll discuss the underload group: It was a disaster. Subjectively the athletes overwhelmingly hated it when feedback was solicited, and objectively the data was clear as day – velocities went directly into the tank by 2+ standard deviations.
Some things said:
Pretty clear loser there. We moved underload balls back to where they’ve always been – at the end of the velocity run-and-gun tests.
The overload group, on the other hand, had mixed but statistically insignificant results. No athletes complained about the grouping of the weighted ball throws (5-6-7-5-4-3 oz) and while the average of the group saw higher velocities, it wasn’t statistically significant – and some lost velocity after throwing the overload baseballs. Some statistically insignificant trends that seemed worthy of future study were found, however:
Overall, I think the idea of PAP is very interesting and perhaps useful when it comes to weighted baseballs, but perhaps not prior to a game. Our study was a very limited trial that did not test one of the most important variables in a game – endurance.
It’s very possible that a comprehensive dynamic warm-up using proper tools captures enough of the “PAP” benefits, and athletes who do not warm-up and potentiate the CNS correctly prior to training or competing may see phantom benefits from what they think is truly PAP.
In that vein, however, we recommend all athletes use Plyo Ball ® to warm-up alongside their dynamic warm-up that should feature resistance bands, foam rollers, and other techniques to properly prepare the body and mind for competing on the diamond.
Yup, my son wanted to be like everyone else and use a donut. I didn’t let him.
But there was that one study that showed a significant positive effect for female softballers. Don’t know if it was ever replicated.
I don’t get this:
“……idea of PAP is very interesting and perhaps useful when it comes to weighted baseballs, but perhaps not prior to a game.”
Then:
“we recommend all athletes use PlyoCare balls ….. to properly prepare the body and mind for competing on the diamond.”
Plyos are weighted balls too. I don’t get the distinction being made here.
We split the distinction between PlyoCare balls and Driveline Elite Weighted Balls (which I refer to as “weighted balls”). Sorry for the confusion
Which means you’ve tested plyos as an effective warmup for throwing from the bump. I saw your tweet pics showing them in your own adult league throwing. Will this be covered in the upcoming book? Did Beav pitchers do this last season?
Yes, though my warm-up with PlyoCare balls is for a different reason. I have a partial thickness tear in my infraspinatus (and likely serious fraying in the supraspinatus), and I use them to activate my posterior shoulder. I’ll do upwards of 40-65 reps (split across 4-6 sets) of external rotation tosses into the air with the 1kg PlyoCare ball prior to picking up a baseball. Usually I do them after foam rolling, LAX ball rollouts, resistance band work, and arm oscillation work (I carry a Total Bar with me since it’s a little more portable than a Shoulder Tube).
It’ll be covered in the upcoming book for sure. Beaver pitchers did not use PlyoCare balls in warm-ups much, or at least it was not prescribed (some may have individually). This year may be different.
Hi Kyle, in regards to what you posted, “weighted ball throws (5-6-7-5-4-3 oz)” is this also in the same order when you guys do regular velo work? Or was this just the order for the study?
Thank you
Just for the study. This sequence also appears in our free weighted baseball eBook, available under “Our Books” in the top nav bar.
I looked in the eBook. What page is it on because the order looks different?
Just as a side note… While training swings (not hitting or barrel accuracy, but swing patterns) I find it very useful when the athlete has an uncomfortably weighted bat to swing. I prefer just a heavy wood bat, but I get really good results from bat weights( the jack-it and donuts). The point is that that pattern needs to be strongly mapped and the athlete needs to have the wherewithal not to press the hands/arms to get the barrel into the zone. This ties into how weighted balls and plyo balls can rewrite inefficient patterns. At first, a poor thrower may push the heavier ball. Good coaching cues, dynamic actions with focus and intent can iron out the process and pattern quickly. With the swing, a heavy bat will help the athlete feel the depth of the barrel bottom out early in the turn in the proper pattern. Like the tendency for an inefficient thrower to push a heavier object at first, heavy bats will further ingrain a bad pressing pattern when left unattended. Also, the different placements of donut  weights, jack-its etc can make this even harder to recognize as you described since sometimes more weight is felt closer to the hands. This is like anything else, any good drill can be woefully miscued or misconstrued by an athlete. Likewise, seemingly ridiculously drill work like throwing heavy balls hard in a pick-off stance can have truly breakthrough results with the right constraints being met. I like to test the “stickiness” of a pattern by seeing the athlete maintain his turn, barrel action depth and momentum transfer hold up to variable bat weights and balances.
What sorts of drills are used with the Plyocare balls? I’ve been looking everywhere and can only find a couple drills in your videos, was wondering if theres anywhere that you talk about drills, rep schemes, etc with them. Thanks
That information is forthcoming in our flagship book and video set product, due out this offseason (December 1st, hopefully).
Hi Kyle,
Back in 2013 Graeme Lehman posted an article on his site regarding a study, ” The acute and chronic effects of isometric contraction conditioning on baseball bat velocity” indicating that a simple on deck warm up routine that induced PAP with isometric contractions increased bat speed. The protocol involved hitters performing four reps of max effort isometric contraction for 5 seconds. A five second rest was allowed between repetitions. The first and third sets used the lead hand while the second and forth sets used the trail hand.  They then rested for one minute and were then able to swing harder than before. As hitting and pitching have similar rotational qualities, do you have any thoughts on whether this might be beneficial for pitchers? Lehman was also considering a study for pitchers using the “Hershiser drill” as the isometric contraction, however, I haven’t seen anything from him on this. Curious to get your thoughts.
[…] This follows our standard regular-overload-regular-underload pattern that we’ve tested over the years. […]

How to Protect Your Curveball - Driveline Baseball,2014-03-14T20:30:49+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/03/protect-curveball/,"I was recently in Spring Training with the MLB team I consult with, watching a few pitchers throw, when a Pitching Coordinator came over and remarked to another pitching coach that pitchers need to throw high fastballs to protect their curveball. I asked the coordinator to expand on his statement, and he explained the tunneling theory of keeping the high fastball in the same tunnel as the middle/low curveball to increase deception – that fastballs located outside of the tunnel can’t adequately “protect” the deception of a pitch with a hump in it.
As most know, I’m on board with tunneling theory, and we teach it all the time at Driveline Baseball:
However, I have never heard it referred to as “protecting your curveball.” I loved it! The phrase makes complete intuitive sense, and the pitchers on the MLB staff in question loved the idea and immediately grasped the concept. This is huge, because we in the nerd/sabermetric community tend to overcomplicate concepts for fear of diluting their meaning – however, simplifying the truth is possibly the most important gap to bridge when it comes to applicable use on the field.
Of course, this phenomenon had already been discussed by my former co-writer, Josh Kalk…
Josh Kalk wrote about how he theorized Ted Lilly threw below-average fastballs up in the zone to protect his curveball in an outstanding Hardball Times article – Pitch sequence: High fastball, low curveball. In the article, Josh illustrated the difference between a fastball that protects a curveball:
And a curveball that is so far outside the fastball’s tunnel that pitch recognition becomes much easier:
Tons of words can be written on pitch tunneling (and will be in my upcoming book!), but this is a great graphical representation of the pitch tunneling theory as well as a bitesize phrase – “protect the curveball” – that makes a lot of sense!
If you’re curious if curveballs are more stressful than fastballs, we investigated that claim in our lab!
Looking forward to the new book. ETA? Got the Everio 210 in this week per your recommendation and hope to put vid of Kell doing TDP tonight.

How Wrist Weights Reduce Your Tommy John Risk,2013-06-28T04:45:35+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2013/06/wrist-weights-tommy-john-risk/,"Longtime readers of this blog know that I am obsessed with technical and anatomical precision – and in many cases, the message can be lost upon your average reader. However, I try to summarize all of my jargon into an immediately understandable conclusion at the end of long articles like Elbow Injuries and What Causes Tommy John Surgery.
One of my clients brought up the fact that I don’t have a very basic article on elbow injuries and wrist weights on our site, and that I should rectify this problem as soon as possible. He’s a huge believer in wrist weights (and so are we), and he had a very, very good layman’s way of explaining how elbow injuries (notably UCL tears) occur. It impressed me so much that I’m going to absolutely plagiarize, steal, and copy it for everyone’s enjoyment here on the blog.
Please note that this article has some inconsistencies and not iron-clad language – but it is meant for you to send to your pitching coach, friends, and other people who won’t immediately turn their brains off due to complex language.
So, without further ado…
Stephen Strasburg at Ball Release
The primary reason pitchers require Tommy John Surgery (TJS) is because the elbow joint is constantly being dislocated in the pitching delivery. The Tommy John ligament ties the lower arm and upper arm together, and when the lower arm is pushed away from the upper arm due to mechanical flaws, this stresses the ligament. Over time, this causes the ligament to stretch out and lose strength, and can eventually cause the ligament to rupture.
Imagine that the ligament is the chain between a pair of nunchucks:
Your pitching arm. Just run with it, OK?
Except also imagine that the chain is more like a piece of shoelace – fairly strong at first, but can be weakened over time by stretching it out constantly.
A big flaw in the pitching delivery involves stress being applied to the side of the arm. If you swing the nunchucks in a long, sideways arc away from your body, you can imagine that the stick furthest away from the body is moving very fast and pulling the chain/shoelace quickly away from the other stick. This stress is what causes the Tommy John ligament to stretch out and eventually rupture.
Wrist weights work in two different ways to help reduce elbow injuries:
By doing specific wrist weight work, you can train the muscles in the lower arm. The muscles in the lower arm attach to the elbow and are responsible for helping to keep the elbow joint stable. Heavy work like deadlifts, rows, and grip work help to train this area, but it is also important to train the lower arm muscles in a sport-specific manner for maximum carryover to the pitching delivery.
Additionally, when done properly, wrist weight work helps to smooth out the arm acceleration phase of the pitching delivery and to reduce the chance that the lower arm “casts” away from the upper arm. This reduces stress and decreases the chance of elbow dislocation as well.
Get a pair of wrist weights, learn how to use them (like we do in our pitching program), and you can help reduce the chance of suffering an elbow injury.
Driveline Baseball has developed a complete training program for pitchers that uses wrist weights along with many other training modalities to produce healthy, high-velocity pitchers. Find a program or schedule a time for us to talk and help you get the most out of your career.
Again, please note that this article was heavily simplified to increase readability. Please consult the following more technical articles for additional information:

What wrist weights do you recommend? Do they come with a program, if not, what program should I use? Thanks.
Hey Chaz! We just opened up pre-order for our new Leather Wrist Weights. Check them out in our shop!
We have other wrist weights that come with our Driveline U program, at the moment, but we are going to switch over. Also, we are likely to create a starter kit for the Leather Wrist Weights. Email or call into support and we can help you choose the program that fits you best!
What do you think about rice buckets? Used to ise them then got away from them over the years.
How early (age) do you start youth players on these? Thx
Depends on how developed the athlete is. Try having him do the movements without any weight at first. Once he has the coordination of the movements down, he can progress up in weight.

"Pitch Tunneling, Featuring Kevin Gausman - Driveline Baseball",2013-05-24T03:35:01+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2013/05/pitch-tunneling-featuring-kevin-gausman/,"From today’s game (God bless technology):
Kevin Gausman
What I said about Kevin Gausman in my 2012 MLB Draft Recap over at THT:
Gausman’s stuff is very good. I prefer guys who have learned a curve ball or at least supplement a side-to-side breaking ball (slider, cutter) with one, and a look at Gausman’s splits shows you why: He has been more effective against lefties than righties in 2012. A true curve ball will tend to yield lower platoon splits than sliders/cutters, and this can be a huge advantage for him as he transitions into professional baseball, making him hard to plan against with the opposing lineup card.
Conclusion: I like Gausman a lot. He is one of the few college pitchers in this lackluster draft who excited me. Great pick by the Orioles.

Choosing the Correct Pitch Sequences: Data-Driven Decisions - Driveline Baseball,2012-05-28T17:30:22+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2012/05/choosing-the-correct-pitch-sequences-data-driven-decisions/,"I wrote this email to the parents and players of our Elite Baseball Training program and figured I’d share it with the public. We use data-driven decisions to form our opinions here, rather than traditional groupthink and coaching platitudes.
———————
All pitchers (and parents of pitchers):
My fellow author at The Hardball Times wrote an awesome article 2+ years ago about pitch types, and updated it in 2011. It’s pretty data-intensive:
https://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/updated-benchmarks-for-pitch-types/
Large-scale data mining of MLB pitches using my database as well as Harry’s work has formed the backbone of why I teach the pitches I do, and the sequencing of them. Though I don’t get too in-depth into this when I work with you guys one-on-one, I figure it’s good to get this information out there for those who are really interested.
For the younger guys, we always recommend training as a starter first, which means commanding two fastballs (four-seam fastball, two-seam fastball/sinker), a curve ball (12-6 or 1-7, preferably the former), a slider/cutter (depending on arm angle and comfort level – how we teach the cutter is basically a slider anyway), and a change-up (can just be the sinker if four-seam velo is < 80 MPH).
Reproducing the relevant chart:
Aside from splitters (not a pitch we generally teach for a variety of reasons), sliders (SL) have the best Whiff Rate, while curveballs (CU) have the best Watch Rate. Fastballs (FA) are the easiest to throw for strikes and generate a lot of foul balls, but the primary reason to throw fastballs is to set up the other pitches. Change-Ups (CH) and Sinkers (SI) have very good GB% rates.
Everything works together. It’s important to realize the role of each pitch:
-Fastballs set the hitters’ expectations for velocity, location, and allow you to easily get ahead in/back into strikeout counts (at the risk of being the easiest pitch to hit)
-Curveballs should be thrown early in counts to tough hitters to disrupt timing and late in counts (2 strikes) to weak hitters who are likely to take strike 3 (at the risk of being a pitch most brutally punished when the spot is missed)
-Sliders should almost always be thrown late in counts to strike hitters out; giving hitters an early look at your left-right breaking ball is generally a huge mistake (at the risk of being a very hard pitch to throw for reliable strikes)
-Change-Ups should be saved for the 2nd and 3rd time through the lineup for a secondary “breaking ball” to get hitters out with; can be used for GIDP situations (at the risk of being a high-contact high-average pitch)
-Sinkers/two-seam fastballs should be used against opposite-hand hitters as you would use your fastball; lean on it heavily to neutralize the platoon advantage and minimize the # of four-seam fastballs thrown to opposite-side hitters (at the risk of being a high-contact high-average pitch)
–Use sinkers/two-seam fastballs for GIDPs, though I recommend against this for pitchers not playing for elite college/select teams (how many GIDPs does the average youth team turn anyway?)
A same-handed hitter perceives a pitch thrown up-and-in to be up to 10% harder than a pitch thrown low-and-away. Watch/take rates go up the bigger the difference between pitch n and pitch n+1 become – this means you should use fastballs in to setup curveballs which setup sliders. Be economical with your pitches and don’t be afraid to experiment. While you don’t need to throw your cutter/slider for strikes reliably, you need to get into as many 1-2 or better counts as possible.
First pitch strikes are important, but the first three pitches together matter the most. The difference between 1-2 and 2-1 is incredibly huge, which is why pitchers should be able to throw all pitches for a combined strike rate of 66%+.
Hope this isn’t too much data!

Locating Up in the Zone - Better for Amateur/Recreational Pitchers - Driveline Baseball,2012-05-14T19:00:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2012/05/locating-up-in-the-zone-better-for-amateurrecreational-pitchers/,"Pitchers at all levels of the game are told to locate their pitches in the bottom half of the zone so they can get hitters to swing over the top of the pitch and produce ground balls. As everyone knows, ground balls are the best way to prevent runs, since you can’t hit ground balls over the fence and it’s tough to hit them into the gaps for extra bases. Apologies to all coaches of youth, high school, and many college pitchers, but: You’re wrong. Pitchers should locate their fastballs and breaking balls in the top half of the zone to get the most success when competing against average youth, high school, and most college hitters.
It’s happened to everyone – including me – you get a ton of ground balls, your defense boots the ball around, you end up giving up 1 or 2 earned runs but a plethora of unearned runs. When your coach comes and pulls you from the game, he says: “Nothing you could have done, kid. Defense just didn’t play behind you,” pats you on the butt, and tells you to get your running in.
Bad luck. Or was it?
Your teammates apologize for booting that easy ball in the hole, for not picking that ball at first base, and dropping that easy double play opportunity. Being a good teammate, you say “Ah, it happens. Get ’em next time.” Then while running your poles, you reflect on how particularly unlucky you were that day. If only Bobby hadn’t lost that ball in the sun and Roger didn’t sail that ball from shortstop, you would have gotten out of that long inning. But were you unlucky? Think about it: You did everything you were supposed to – get a few strikeouts, not walk too many, and got a lot of ground balls. And what were you rewarded with? Hasn’t this happened before? What if you got fly balls instead? Don’t hitters swing and miss on your fastballs up in the zone – and when they make contact, don’t they often go for fly ball outs? How many home runs does the entire school have, anyway? Four? But what’s the team batting average – .380? Here are the two major reasons you want to get ground balls at the MLB level:
Think about those reasons for a minute. Do either of those reasons apply to your high school league? What do you think the average HR rate on fly balls is in your league? I guarantee it’s not 11%. (MLB Average HR/FB rate.) We’ve already established defenders at the HS/College level are orders of magnitude worse than the Dominican and Venezuelan infielders of MLB (to say nothing of the local product), so why are you applying a heuristic to a completely different game?
Tons of data and a shattered myth after the jump…
I took the 2011 hitting stats from the largest local amateur league here – Puget Sound Senior Baseball League – and took the division (Adams) that fields teams that are most like your average varsity high school team. If you didn’t know the players in the league were too old to be in high school and could objectively watch the quality of their play, I’d argue that the average team in this league would fit right into a large high school conference. Most of the players in the league played Varsity HS or college baseball (with some ex-pros in there). Since we don’t have batted ball data, I made the folllowing big assumption:
At any rate, here’s the data:  (IFFB is subtracted from FB in the bottom right chart but not in the raw totals in the top right.)
What conclusions can we draw from this?
HR/FB ratio in the big leagues averages just about 11% as we stated above. However, HR/FB ratio in this league is 4.76% – less than half of the MLB average! (We’re assuming all the HRs hit were on fly balls, which is generally accepted as true when looking at stringer data from Baseball Info Solutions.) This means that the run value of a fly ball should dramatically decrease! Shorthand is to say that fly balls produce 0.13 runs/out while ground balls product 0.05 runs/out, but if HR rate is halved on fly balls, runs produced will be cut significantly AND outs per fly ball will go up significantly.
David Gassko showed us that grounders account for 85% of all errors at the major league level, and that 2.23% of all grounders hit are scored as errors. It’s obvious that more errors will be produced on ground balls when the fielders are markedly worse, and that the first percentage will likely go up as a result!
If you look at the chart above, you can see the Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) is .380. MLB average is about .290 – no surprise here, the fielders are not only going to commit more errors, but simply won’t get to more balls leading to hits falling in. As we see, Predicted Average using BABIP of MLB batted ball types is .292, while in reality the real batting average of the league is .318 – a difference of 26 points of batting average! Though BABIP obviously increases across the board as the defense of the league gets worse (and batted ball speed does not exceed that factor; which I feel confident in saying since they mostly used BESR metal bats in 2011), I’d argue that it’s not a normal distribution and that ground ball BABIP goes up by a larger factor than the other batted ball types. Evidence for that is simply due to decreased range, worse reaction speed, worse hands, and weaker throwing arms – all of these factors impact fielding ground balls far more than they do line drives and fly balls. As stated above, ground balls produce 0.05 runs/out at the MLB level, but this will certainly go up – and I’d argue, surpass – the runs/out value of fly balls when you factor everything together!
Trevor Bauer made a splash when he made these tweets:   Bauer is a very smart individual, and he’s followed the work of people who have done studies on pitch location and batted ball types like Perry Husband. Sabermetric studies have been done on MLB pitching/hitting to try and uncover what Bauer was saying, but they missed out on a critical factor: Adjusting for environment! Bauer is almost certainly right when he talked about his experiences in high school and college (even in the Pac-12), and he may very well be correct when it comes to the minor leagues as well!
Fastballs up in the zone reach the catcher faster than fastballs down in the zone do, and fastballs up and in to a same handed batter as you reach the catcher the fastest. Additionally, hitters are typically able to take fastballs down in the zone with more regularity but have higher swing percentages on fastballs up in the zone. In the same article about Bauer’s comments, you can see that MLB swing and miss % on fastballs up in the zone far exceeds swing and miss % in the bottom half of the zone. You don’t need a rocket scientist to tell you that a higher whiff rate on your pitches will lead to increased strikeout totals, right?
Fortunately, this one’s easy – there are a few factors that produce more fly balls over ground balls:
It’s About The Money did a great study of right-handed pitchers and ground ball effects, and those were the two main conclusions they came up with (reverse, since they were investigating what causes ground balls). If you can consistently locate your pitches up and out of the zone, you can get more fly balls, as evidenced by these graphs/heat maps:
GB Rate – Horizontal Location
And then ground ball / fly ball rate by heat map location for all hitters combined:
GB Rate – Pitch Location
“But,” you say, “fastballs up in the zone get pounded for line drives!” Study of MLB hitters doesn’t seem to indicate this is the case – it’s pitches down the pipe that get the laser show treatment. Here’s a heatmap of line drives hit by Joey Votto (source: Baseball Analytics):
Votto LD Heatmap
If you’re playing below the MLB level, you probably don’t want ground balls if you want to make the most amount of outs. You definitely want to stay out of the middle of the plate, but pitch up in the zone (and outside) to get fly ball outs. Unless, of course, you like getting ground balls, watching your fielders kick it around the infield, and leaving the game early with a lot of unearned runs. You’ll have “done your job,” but your team will win less games. Remember, unearned runs still count as runs on the scoreboard.
Awesome.

[…] -Fastballs set the hitters’ expectations for velocity, location, and allow you to easily get ahead in/back into strikeout counts (at the risk of being the easiest pitch to hit) -Curveballs should be thrown early in counts to tough hitters to disrupt timing and late in counts (2 strikes) to weak hitters who are likely to take strike 3 (at the risk of being a pitch most brutally punished when the spot is missed) -Sliders should almost always be thrown late in counts to strike hitters out; giving hitters an early look at your left-right breaking ball is generally a huge mistake (at the risk of being a very hard pitch to throw for reliable strikes) -Change-Ups should be saved for the 2nd and 3rd time through the lineup for a secondary “breaking ball” to get hitters out with; can be used for GIDP situations (at the risk of being a high-contact high-average pitch) -Sinkers/two-seam fastballs should be used against opposite-hand hitters as you would use your fastball; lean on it heavily to neutralize the platoon advantage and minimize the # of four-seam fastballs thrown to opposite-side hitters (at the risk of being a high-contact high-average pitch) –Use sinkers/two-seam fastballs for GIDPs, though I recommend against this for pitchers not playing for elite college/select teams (how many GIDPs does the average youth team turn anyway?)

Craig Kimbrel's 95 MPH Fastball Velocity - How Did He Get It?,2011-09-28T20:30:20+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/09/craig-kimbrels-95-mph-velocity-how-did-he-get-it/,"If you’ve paid any attention to the MLB season this year, you know Craig Kimbrel throws hard. In fact, Craig Kimbrel has the ninth-highest fastball velocity amongst all relievers in the big leagues in 2011, averaging over 96 MPH. According to Fangraphs’ pitch values, Kimbrel also has the fourth-best slider amongst relievers, behind his teammate Johnny Venters – who features the best slider in the game.
There are three great points that Joe Lemire’s article brings up, and they are:
When Kimbrel broke his foot and was unable to walk, let alone throw a baseball from his feet, he took to throwing long toss from his knees:
Unable to put weight on his foot, much less pitch, Kimbrel arrived at school and took to long tossing from his knees. Soon, he was able to cover the length of a football or soccer field.
“It’s kind of weird to say that breaking your foot is the best thing that could happen to you, but it seems like it ended up working out that way,” said Kimbrel, who is now the closer for the wild-card-leading Braves and a virtual lock to win NL Rookie of the Year honors. “It helped me understand how I move my upper body. Once I started using my lower body, it all came together.”
The understanding and strengthening that came with Kimbrel’s forced isolation of his upper body and lower body led to dramatically improved performance.
Kimbrel learned how to optimize his arm action through what is commonly called “constraint training,” where part of your body is intentionally held back (constrained) in order to get an athlete to focus on a specific part of a movement. Constraint training is a great way to learn pitching mechanics. Too much constraint training can constitute “part training” where the partial movements are never integrated into the full movement, but not doing any at all will confuse an athlete. Trying to explain the nuances of arm action or ball release while a pitcher is going through his full mechanics off a mound is impossible.
By having a built-in constraint, Kimbrel forced himself to figure out how to throw a baseball with enough force to cover a football field from his knees, which is even one hell of an accomplishment for a guy from his feet! When Kimbrel could integrate his more efficient arm action into his previous lower half mechanics, he saw a big jump in his fastball velocity.
In Lemire’s article, he says:
Kimbrel, who played both baseball and football at Lee High in Hunstville, Ala., said he previously weight-trained only in summers and falls for football and would lose all that he gained during winters and springs; at Wallace State he trained year-round.
This is extremely common amongst prep athletes and really not all that rare in the professional ranks, either! You have many organizations telling athletes to take 6-12 weeks completely off of training, which robs them of a ton of valuable training time and also causes atrophy in the body. Resting for no reason is atrophy, pure and simple. It’s one thing to tell 9 year olds to stop throwing baseballs in the winter because of growth plate fracture concerns and another thing to tell a 17 year old heading into his senior year of high school to simply lose 3 months of training time. If you want to throw harder, a pitching-specific workout is critical–and they are a major part of our training programs. Gaining strength could be the difference between a college scholarship and completely washing out of post-secondary baseball entirely, and it’s irresponsible.
Kimbrel was a decent high school pitcher going to a junior college, throwing in the upper-80’s and he suffered a traumatic injury.
Most people would simply sit on the sidelines and wait until it healed, hoping to get back into fall ball where their velocity would undoubtably be in the low-80’s at best. Then the hypothetical person in Kimbrel’s shoes would probably get passed over a starting spot and get stuck in the back of the bullpen for his freshman year – a huge blow to his chances to make pro or Division-I baseball by wasting a full year of junior college.
Instead, Kimbrel went to the field and threw baseballs out of a bucket across a football field. And I’m sure there were times he didn’t have a partner to throw to, and he threw a bucket of baseballs across the field and hopped on some crutches to pick them up afterwards.
Learning how to throw harder takes an obsessive dedication to practice. Right now, there are plenty of college pitchers who throw 88 MPH and will never develop Craig-Kimbrel-esque velocity.
Obsessive dedication to practice is what it takes to turn a decent player into a big leaguer, and it exists in few individuals.
If you don’t have it, you have to be god’s gift to throwing a fastball to make it. And chances are good that, if you’re reading this blog, you aren’t.
Next time you skip a Plyo Ball ® workout or long toss in favor of hanging out with friends or playing Xbox, think about what it takes to reach your dream and others are willing to do to take it from you.

Craig Kimbrel's Overpowering Velocity - How Did He Get It? - Driveline Baseball,2011-09-28T20:30:20+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/09/craig-kimbrels-overpowering-velocity-how-did-he-get-it/,"If you’ve paid any attention to the MLB season this year, you know Craig Kimbrel’s name. He’s the flame-throwing closer in the lights-out bullpen of the Atlanta Braves, also featuring deadly setup man Johnny Venters.
Craig Kimbrel has the ninth-highest fastball velocity amongst all relievers in the big leagues in 2011, just ahead of Jason Motte of the Cardinals and right behind Brandon League of the Mariners. According to Fangraphs’ pitch values, Kimbrel has the fourth-best slider amongst relievers, behind his teammate Johnny Venters – who features the best slider in the game.
So you know that Kimbrel and Venters are both lights out and have lightning in their arms. But what you might not know is that this dynamic duo almost never came to be: Kimbrel’s foot was broken into pieces at age 18. Heading into that injury, Kimbrel was throwing in the upper 80’s and had a commitment to a junior college. So how did he get to become one of the hardest-throwing relievers in baseball?

[…] Craig Kimbrel’s Overpowering Velocity – How Did He Get It? | Driveline Baseball – Good story on fireballer Kimbrel, who was not always a fireballer. […]
As Craig’s off season trainer I will sum up what we emphase in following concepts 1) Eccentric concentration on his backside mechanics. 2) dynamic flexibility and Mobility on the frontside mechanics. 3) 2:1 ratio on upper body work ex.two joint pull, one joint backside Stabilazation then frontside with special attention to focusing on what is occurring between the Set-up, mid point and follow thru Stabilazation. Press On!
Thanks for chiming in, Dallas!
Silly question – is he facing the target when throwing from his knees or is he rotated 90 degrees?

Flat curve ball? Stop throwing strikes! - Driveline Baseball,2011-05-19T23:50:29+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/05/flat-curve-ball-stop-throwing-strikes/,"A common problem with pitchers of all ages is the inability to control their curveball. Sometimes it’ll be great, and sometimes it’ll come out of their hand flat. (I have this problem myself!) Most of the time the problem revolves around the pitcher throwing the ball to the target and not focusing on the quality of the pitch. This happens with fastballs too, but the fix is different – and a topic for another blog post.
Pitchers think too much about throwing their curveball for a strike. What you can do to help increase both the quality and consistency of your curveball is to stop doing this in your bullpen sessions. Yes, your bullpen sessions should focus on throwing a high percentage of strikes most of the time, but you also need to work on pitch quality as well. This means throwing fastballs at maximum intensity without care for location to understand what it will take to tame that chaotic delivery, and it also means spiking curveballs in front of the catcher.
Just bounce your curveballs in front of the plate. This guy does all the time!
Find yourself a good catcher – who you’ll buy a milkshake for after you’re done beating him up – and have him set up normally in the middle of the plate (or slightly to the glove side if you throw a slurve). Do NOT throw curve balls for strikes, but instead deliberately throw them so they land a foot in front of the catcher. If you don’t have a catcher, you can just set up a net behind the plate and practice this – perhaps marking the target with some white athletic tape.
By working on the depth of your curveball, you ignore the pressures of throwing strikes and can instead just work on the pitch’s movement. Over a few bullpen sessions, slowly work this feeling back into your regular strike-throwing sessions and you’ll see that the control of your curveball will come back as you increase your confidence in the ability to throw it.
One of my favorite pitches in baseball is the “back foot” slider, but you can do the same basic thing with a curve or slurve.
My point being that this pitch is not just something you can practice to improve the quality of your breaking ball.
