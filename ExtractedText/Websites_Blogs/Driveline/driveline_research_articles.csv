Impulse: The King of Performance Metrics - Driveline Baseball,2025-02-04T09:31:22+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2025/02/impulse-the-king-of-performance-metrics/,"The world of player development is convoluted, with a litany of different systems and viewpoints biased from everything from biomechanics, to workload management, to neural pathways and dozens of other factors. All of these viewpoints can provide valuable secondary context to performance, but the majority of sporting activity really comes down to these two things, applied in a variety of ways:
You need to change the displacement of either your center of mass, or that of a separate implement, to get it to a more desired location on the playing field.
You typically need to be able to do this at very high velocities, and be able to manipulate the direction and rate of change of those velocities to avoid opponents, or get in the way of their inversely oriented displacement objectives.
First, let’s start with a brief overview on Newtonian Mechanics. For our purposes (not diving into relativity or quantum mechanics here) we can split this branch of physics into Kinetics and Kinematics, two main concepts that allow us to understand sports performance.
Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the kinetics that caused the motion. It focuses on quantities like displacement, velocity, and acceleration, which are also all vector quantities (have both magnitude and direction).
Kinematic Quantities
Displacement: The shortest distance from an object’s initial to final position, with respect to direction.
Velocity: The rate of change of displacement with respect to time.
Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time.
When it comes to making connections between displacement, velocity and acceleration, it can also be very useful to understand the calculus principles of Integrals and Derivatives.
A derivative measures the rate of change of a quantity, giving the slope of a function at any point. A integral does the opposite, calculating the accumulation of a quantity by measuring the area under the curve.
Here are paired kinematics graphs of simple motion examples you may see in real life. Take a moment to apply the calculus principles listed above to make connections between displacement, velocity, and acceleration for each example. This derivative relationship between velocity and acceleration is the one people seem to have the biggest issue understanding. To make things simple, if the directions of velocity and acceleration are the same, regardless of magnitude, the object is speeding up. If they are opposite, the object is slowing down.
Let’s start here by defining Impulse and Momentum.
Impulse (J) is defined as the product of the net force acting on an object and the duration of time that force is applied. So in short, it is the total area underneath the Force-Time curve (an integral, just like we talked about earlier). J=F​Δt.
Momentum is defined as the product of an object’s mass and its velocity. .It represents how much “motion” an object carries. The main goal of a thrower, for example, is to change the implements momentum as much as possible. p=mv.
Impulse–Momentum Theorem states that the net impulse on an object is equal to its change in momentum: J=Δp=mv(f​inal)−mv(i​nitial). In the majority of non-contact sporting contexts, mass is constant, so we can write the formula like this-
F​Δt= m(vf-vi).
This is a perfect example of forward dynamics at work, going from force (kinetics) to velocity (kinematics). So to be able to change the momentum of our center of mass, or the center of mass of a separate implement, the goal is to create as much positive impulse as possible.
Side Note- The fact that Impulse is a integral is exactly why it is so reliable, because it is a full look at the area under the force-time curve. This is why more derivative-based metrics like peak power are much more variable and not as reliable, because they only exist at one specific point on the force time curve. A longer write up on this by Dr. Jason Lake can be found here.
In order to create as much area under the force time curve to change their momentum, there are three main strategies athletes can employ. These strategies do not exist on a binary, all three strategies need to be be used to maximize impulse.
1. Create greater peak forces, allowing for a taller force-time curve. This can be done by improving neuromuscular output, and improving coordination to take advantage of more favorable leverage positions.
2. Improve the rate of force development to which they reach peak force, allowing for steeper sides of the force-time curve. Likewise, this can be done by improving neuromuscular output, and improving coordination to take advantage of more favorable leverage positions.
3. Increase the width of the force-time curve by lengthening the duration of the impulse. This strategy has is more limited compared to the other two, as the majority of sporting movements are placed under severe time constraints. A great example of a positive way to employ this strategy would be imprioving a throwers horizontal abduction and external rotation of the throwing arm will lengthen the amount of time they have to put force into the implement, increasing the impulse.
Cleather, D. (2021). Force: The biomechanics of training.
An example of a Drop Jump (Top) and Depth Jump (Bottom). The Drop Jump biases higher rate of force development, with significantly lower ground contact times, resulting in a much sharper force curve. The Depth Jump has longer ground contact times, which allows for more total impulse under the curve, creating a higher jump. Neither is necessarily “better”, they’re just two different strategies for producing impulse.
So when trying to improve skill outputs, its a question of improve the athletes ability to express impulse within the constraints of the skill. The question then is “how do we improve the athletes lowest hanging fruit when it comes to impulse strategies, while maintaining and improving on the strategies they currently do well?”.
One of the four main buckets of constraints you can place on the throw is changing the mass of the implement.
One of the foundational principles of variably loaded ballistic work is that it provides varied movement strategies due to the difference in the implements inertia⬇️ pic.twitter.com/B02Y88XOym
— Brice Crider (@Crider_HP) January 11, 2025
From there, we can start to look at some of the underlying reasons (anatomy, physiology, etc.) why the athlete produces impulse the way they do, and begin to work on some of those pieces to improve the athletes outputs. This is where most people have it backwards. They start with more subjective looks at A&P, and try to use the information to improve sports performance, without really ever quantifying outputs, both in general and in specific.
Clayton Thompson wrote a great blog on this exact subject- The Case Against ISA.
Muscle Driven Outputs – Push and Pull
The push strategy is mainly driving by the contractile tissue (muscle) changing length, allowing the athlete to manipulate their center of mass using ground force reactions. Especially in something like the jump where the load is centered within the athletes center of mass, the athlete will employ a combination of hip and knee flexion/extension to accomplish the task of putting force into the ground.
Because these forces are mainly created by contractile tissue, there is a delay caused by the need for signaling at the neuromuscular junction, actin-myosin binding, and finally contraction, which biases a wider impulse curve. This isn’t to say that collision based movements don’t involve muscular contraction, they’re just less biased to being reliant on muscular output.
A countermovement jump is a good look at how muscular forces are used to create the positive impulse that changes an athletes momentum in the vertical direction.
A collision is an event in which two or more objects come into contact and exert forces on each other over a short period of time. Many high speed sporting outputs are reliant on managing these collisions using both active and passive structures to be able to efficiently transfer energy up the kinetic chain. These collisions can be managed in two main ways, by bouncing or blocking. The main way to differentiate between is by looking at the stiffness of the collision, also known as the collision coefficient.
The collision coefficient gives a look at the conservation of momentum. In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy is conserved, creating an opposite “bounce”. In a perfectly inelastic collision, Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not, causing a “stick” or “block”. Because the elastic collision is created by deformation of one or both of the physical bodies involved in the collision, the rate of force development is lower than in the inelastic collision.
An example of bounce and block strategies shown by dropping a 2.5 lb plate and a rubber ball-
The bounce strategy is far more elastic, allowing for some deformation of the limbs to smoothly transition from yielding and braking into propulsion.
The block strategy is far more inelastic, aiming to bring a sudden halt, which is very useful for rapidly stopping certain pieces to send energy up the kinetic chain.
All of these biomechanical impulse strategies don’t exist on a binary, but rather exist on a spectrum. The majority of sporting actions require the athlete to use all four strategies simultaneously as they express force and send energy from piece to piece through the kinetic chain.
Sprinting employs push, pull, and bounce strategies to produce high peak forces in a small time window.
If there’s one takeaway from this entire piece, it’s that analysis of sports performance should start by looking at what actually moves the needle: force production.
Understanding the newtonian mechanics behind impulse will give you a more foundational and holistic backing to your training interventions, so you can spend less time guessing, and improve performance.
Happy Hunting.

Trusting The Numbers: An Exploration Into Data Skepticism - Driveline Baseball,2024-08-21T15:32:34+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2024/08/trusting-the-numbers-an-exploration-into-data-skepticism/,"The world as we know it is inherently data-driven; from the very computer on which this thing you are reading is being written, to the complexities of the stock market — modern life, for better or worse, seems not to be much more than the product of a cleverly constructed series of ones and zeroes. In the same vein, and as the proliferation of technological development accelerates full-steam ahead into an era of late-stage industrialization, our ability to capture, quantify, and understand real-world phenomena will only continue to improve and extend its bounds. Such a continuation is not limited only to the worlds of technology and business however, as sports analytics are — despite the observed contention and hesitation that surrounds them — riding the same progressive curve. This aforementioned contention and hesitation are, regardless of any proven efficacy, uphill ideological and philosophical battles being engaged with everyday.
MLB organization quantity of dedicated analytics staff compared to the number of games won by that team in the last 5 season (r² = 0.61).
Asking questions and entertaining skepticism are innately human traits, and while there are biological arguments as to why both may have had and still maintain a socio-evolutionary utility in preserving both our ideas and our person, denying the proven results of these data-driven approaches and the long-spanning success of quantitative reasoning begs the question: in the year 2024, why do we still distrust the data?
A well-founded place to begin answering the question of data skepticism is seen in, of all things, the 2015 film, The Big Short. The film is a somewhat-fictionalized retelling of the intricacies of the 2008 financial crisis, and is — in its own right — very much a story of distrust and skepticism. In short, the film breaks down the means by which investors were able to foresee and capitalize on a housing market crash that only they predicted and understood the magnitude of. At the closing of the story, as the film’s main character — Dr. Michael J. Burry — closes his hedge fund (Scion Capital) in the wake of an unimaginable net gain, a monologue on the nature of selective authority is shared. He states:
“People want an authority to tell them how to value things, but they choose this authority not based on facts or results — they choose it because it seems authoritative and familiar.”
Much the same, the very ignorance to data we discuss is rooted not in fact or authority, but in that we do not understand it, in that we — therefore — do not trust it, and in that we — subsequently — are unwilling to recognize its validity. Humans are subject to cognitive bias and misdirection because we are designed to seek out and follow the path of least resistance. We therein are designed to trust the thing that is, naturally, most authoritative and familiar. Ultimately, the issue of data skepticism is not rooted in convincing distrusting populations that our data is truthful or that our insights are correct, but in understanding why they trust the people, the sources, and the ideas that they trust. Yes, the doubters do need convincing, but even more so — they need to be understood.
Developing an understanding of why we believe the things we do and why we trust who we trust is an investigation into perception and, therefore, is an interdisciplinary undertaking; humans are, by our very nature, complex and multifaceted. Moreover, our perceptions of the world — the intricate foundation of the very question being asked — are informed by an uncountable number of sources including our interactions with other people, our interactions with technology, and our intrapersonal interactions. It is because of this that our derived interpretation and subsequent understanding of our surroundings is largely what determines our relationship with the world — we are ultimately the products of our individual subjectivity.
From a technical perspective, the question of data distrust is rooted in the underlying issue of, what we will call, opacity — defined by Jenna Burrell as the degree to which an individual does not understand the thing they are interacting with. Opacity inherently creates barriers to understanding, thereby causing hesitation to accept the result of that process and ultimately distrust towards those responsible for producing the result.
Simply put, “opacity can create a barrier to trust. If people cannot understand how a decision was made, they are less likely to trust it…” (Burrell, J. 2016). This phenomenon is not exclusive to abstract technical concepts, however, as a failure to clearly outline the processes by which one reaches their conclusions would naturally result in distrust towards those subsequent findings in any field — sports analytics included.
While Burrell’s opacity is indeed a prominent issue to be considered in our approach, it is not the only issue — the failure to deliver data-driven ideas to non-data-driven minds is, as Donald Norman cites, a design issue as well. In Norman’s 2013 book, The Design of Everyday Things, he makes the supporting point that user error is, in actuality, just another sub-sect of design error, stating that “Good design requires everything be visible, that the operations be clear, and that there be a good conceptual model which guides the user as to what is possible and how to achieve it.” To Norman’s point, user error is not isolated — rather, it is the result of poor design which ultimately facilitates an erroneous user experience. Much the same, a poorly-designed explanation of data-pertaining concepts to the general populace underlies the populace’s very failure to understand those concepts; their lack of comprehension and willingness to accept something they do not understand is, thereby, ultimately not a failure on their own behalf, but a failure on behalf of those responsible for presenting the information — it is a failure on behalf of data analysts like me, and including me!
Norman further explains that “Well-designed objects are easy to interpret and understand. They contain visible clues to their operation.” From this, we should deduce that if an athlete, a user, or any general member of the greater populace is expected to understand the results of our analysis, it must be presented in a way that facilitates their understanding and mitigates the probability of confusion. What does this look like in practice?
In the same regard that a user’s experience with a piece of technology determines their perception of that device, the experience that an athlete, or any audience otherwise, has with quantitative insights is ultimately determinant in their trust and the perceived validity of that information. By that same comparison, we can then conclude that the job of the quantitative analyst is not only to analyze, but to sell and to present that analysis — and to do so in such a manner that facilitates the audience’s understanding, acceptance, and — most critically — trust in the numbers.
The issue of quantitative skepticism is not solely one of opacity, nor is it one solely of erroneous design; this is, rather, an issue of interdisciplinary consideration. The sociological lens, in its plentiful contrast to that of the technical, offers an explanation rooted in the intricate means by which humans interact with one another. Such a perspective posits that the populace’s hesitation towards and distrust of data-driven methodologies is rooted in perceived power dynamics, social hierarchies, and disconnections in communication.
Power and knowledge directly imply one another, and as author Michael Foucault explains in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of The Prison, “there is no power relation without the correlation constituent to a field of knowledge.” To Foucault’s point, one’s knowledge of a field establishes the perceived power that the individual has within that discipline; moreover, if a quantitative analyst perceives themself and is perceived by others as being highly knowledgeable in their field, they are likely to experience a feeling of power in that field. Because of this perceived position of power, they then place themself and are also placed by others higher on the social hierarchy, thereby perceivably disconnecting themself from the very audience to which they wish to communicate their ideas in the first place. Subsequently, that same audience also becomes distrusting of this individual because they too feel disconnected, and in an effort to share an idea about the world, we ultimately create a cycle of continued social dissociation.
Such a result is the consequence of poor communication and a lack of care for the public’s perception — these disconnections are ultimately and entirely avoidable. When tactile social measures are not taken, however, resistance and ideological opposition are then experienced on behalf of both parties. This resistance is, as Foucault further explains, “never [an] exteriority in relation to power”, meaning that resistance is not only a response to power, but the natural result. From this, we should deduce that those responsible for managing the populace’s perceptions — in this case, the analysts — must present their work in a manner that not only expedites an understanding of the information, but also lowers social barriers, ultimately making the person responsible for the work perceivably more accessible to the audience. How does one go about doing so?
Through the sociological lens, these hesitations to trust the numbers can also be understood as the product of an ideological resource conflict. In this context, we are all in competition with one another for control of a resource — more specifically, control of the status quo. Each of us, and the ideological in-groups we belong to, seek to maximize the influence and prominence of our ideas such that those ideas can survive and spread for as long as possible; in a manner much the same to how biological organisms are subject to Darwin’s idea of natural selection, our ideologies and the in-groups which are created around them are also subject to a sort-of Social Darwinism. By this comparison, we can come to understand that an ideology that aims to sustain must adapt in its approach to communication and capture as many minds as possible such that it maximizes its probability of survival.
Darwin’s Finches — best known as the group of birds in the Galapagos Islands which heavily informed Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.
Just as two birds on a branch fight for individual territory, we compete for occupancy in the minds of the public. As H. Tajfel and J.C. Turner explain in their 1979 article, An Integrative Theory of Intergroup Conflict, disagreements and subsequent discrepancies between groups arise “when [those] groups compete for the same resource [because] they are perceived threats to the groups’ status and power.” It is for this reason that conflicts between disagreeing groups on this matter occur so frequently; the mere existence of an opposition is, in and of itself, an innate detraction from one’s efforts towards ideological survival.
Humans are innately prone to biases, and while the already-discussed technical and sociological lenses certainly construct a foundation in answering the initially-posed question of data distrust, our approach to an answer is, perhaps, most strongly rooted in the discipline of psychology. By means of the psychological perspective, we can understand that heuristics and the innate cognitive biases derived from our mental conceptualization of the world are determining factors in the populace’s distrust of data — as they are in ultimately anything one does not intuitively understand to be true. The push to shift this ideological paradigm of skepticism is, in totality, an uphill battle against human nature. In their 1974 article Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman explain that humans are “reliant on a limited number of heuristic principles which reduce the complex tasks of assessing probabilities and predicting values to simpler judgmental operations.” To their point, we are constrained by the heuristics — or mental shortcuts — that we use in everyday life; and even if these shortcuts do allow us to simplify and make sense of a complex world, they ultimately lead us towards incomplete and, often, incorrect conclusions.
This aforementioned “uphill battle” is not solely a matter of heuristics and biases, however, as it is — of course — multifaceted and influenced by, what Tversky and Kahneman referred to as, the “initial value”. They defined this concept as a mental starting point — the preconceived notion — from which people then slowly deviate as new information is introduced. In practice, our estimates “[start] from an initial value that is adjusted to yield the final answer. The initial value, or starting point, may be suggested by the formulation of the problem, or it may be the result of a partial computation.” Just as Tversky and Kahneman posit, our pre-existing conceptualization of an idea is what ultimately rules our perception of that idea, as even when new information is introduced and adequately processed, we are still agnostic to the original conceptualization, merely deviating from an initial value. This starting point, which ultimately serves as a mental anchor of sorts, is — in part — why we so often fall victim to confirmation bias and so often observe illusory correlations. If we want something to be true, especially if we perceive that idea to be true, it becomes very difficult to deviate from the initial value to such a magnitude that we longer maintain such a perception — it is, truly, an uphill battle.
There is, lastly, a psycho-evolutionary component that is integral to the construction of these innate notions — the unconscious. While it is indeed difficult to overcome the biases of that for which we are aware, it is infinitely more difficult to deviate from that which exists in the back of our minds. Not only do these seemingly-intuitive biases have much lower barriers to operational access, but they also occur much faster and are therein more difficult to prevent. Innately, it is easier to use our intuition; and from an evolutionary perspective, it is also far less resource-intensive than executing an in-depth analysis. As Gerd Gigenrezer explains in Gut Feeling: The Intelligence of Unconscious, “people use their instincts because [they] have evolved over time to help us … make quick decisions”, which ultimately keep us alive as “unconscious processes are … much faster than conscious deliberation.” To Gigenrezer’s point, it is perhaps better to be quick and wrong — having at least executed an action — than to be slow and correct, but dead. When not in immediate danger, however, we are afforded time to deliberate, and as it pertains to the understanding of quantitative insights, we should take the time to challenge our preconceived notions; we should take the time to deviate from what we think we know to be true; and we should aim to be more correct in an effort to better understand the world within which we exist. The psycho-evolutionary perspective would posit that people are hesitant to draw their conclusions from and give their trust to data because they are slow to adapt, and because the previous means by which they reached conclusions were effective enough — fine; but just because the status quo is good enough does not mean we should not or cannot strive for something better.
To answer the question of why so many still struggle to trust the numbers is ultimately a matter of understanding human nature; it is a matter of understanding that humans cut corners and that we cheat; it is a matter of understanding that we will believe what we want to believe even if that belief does not hold true; above all, however, it is a matter of reconciling with the fact that despite inventing the computer, despite formulating cures for deadly disease, and despite pushing the bounds of what we know to be possible, we are still imperfect creatures. We distrust data not because it is right, not because it is what will drive progress — doing so will guarantee quite the opposite, in fact — but because we are in an ever-lasting search for the path of least resistance. We want things to be easy because to be easy is to be certain and stable, and humanity is fragile — our existence is delicate.
As it is, there will always be sects of civilization that disagree, and much the same there will always be a pro and an anti as it pertains to the perception of data and analytics. Nonetheless, bridges are meant to be crossed, and minds are meant to be changed — evolution is the driving force of survival, and in our pursuit to preserve our ideologies, we shall seek to understand just as we do to be understood. Perhaps we may draw closer along the way.

Q1 - 2023 Developer Notes - Driveline Baseball,2023-05-04T16:57:40+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2023/05/q1-2023-developer-notes/,
Biomechanics Recap - Summer ‘22 - Driveline Baseball,2022-11-03T19:06:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/11/biomechanics-recap-summer-22/,"The 2022 college summer training season 2022 is winding down. Players are returning to school for fall ball, competing for playing time, and gearing up for the coming spring season. Back in Kent, we’re able to take a step back and catch our collective breath before ramping back up for the pro offseason in a few weeks.
As we transition between those training periods, we thought it would be a good time to reflect on all we accomplished this summer. Here’s our by the numbers recap of the 2022 college summer at Driveline…
All stats you see below are taken from our internal pitching and hitting biomechanics databases which process every pitch and swing we record in the motion capture lab and update nightly. For the purpose of this article, we will filter down to between May 1st and September 1st.
Summary Stats (Pitchers) (fastballs only):
Summary Stats (Hitters):
If you include retests, we conducted just over 500 assessments in one summer training period. In other words, we collected a lot of data.
For pitchers, this meant processing biomechanics data from (at least) five fastballs + any relevant offspeed pitches, pairing Rapsodo, Trackman, and Pulse data, and uploading that paired data to our internal databases + the athlete’s TRAQ profile. We also automatically recorded slow motion Edgertronic videos for each rep.
On the hitting side, this meant processing biomechanics data from at least 8 swings, pairing HitTrax and Blast data, uploading that paired data to our internal databases + the athlete’s TRAQ profile, and recording each swing in high-definition slowmo with our synched Edgertronics.
It actually didn’t! Let’s break it down with some back-of-the-napkin math…
For one of our department’s key performance indicators (KPIs), we track how much time we spend
1) in the lab physically collecting data
2) sitting behind a desk processing the data and
3) troubleshooting any bugs that happen to come up during processing.
All these categories are combined into one “Mocap Operations Hours” KPI.
Obviously, we want that number as low as possible.
As you can see from the figure above, we were well under 2hrs/assessment for the majority of the summer busy season. According to our time tracking, we spent 611 total labor hours on 510 assessments, which comes out to 1.2 hrs/assessment.
Let’s look at it from a department resource standpoint…
As of the time of this blog, there are five full-time sport science employees at Driveline Baseball. If you assume 40 hr work weeks (which we know is not the case during pro and college teams’ busy seasons) over the ~ 18 weeks between May 1st and September 1st, you get 3,600 total labor hours (5 employees * 40 hours * 18 weeks).
611 Mocap Operations hours represent approximately 17% of the total department labor hours. Our employees spent less than 1/5th of their time collecting, processing, and troubleshooting biomechanics data; leaving over 4/5ths of their time for better things.
What better things, you ask? Well, things like building our first occlusion + deception models, documenting return to play progress in unprecedented motion capture detail, testing our new Smash Factor Balls™, developing video reports to better communicate biomechanics reports to visual learners, investigating mechanics of two-way players, measuring catcher receiving and blocking performance, collecting more longitudinal data on our academy athletes to better understand youth skill development, helping our academic partners with their research projects, revamping our premium biomechanics services, telling everyone how cool our systems are, and more…
You get the point; we’ve been busy.
Summer ‘22 offseason training paints an optimistic picture. Players are getting better on both sides of the ball. On the pitching side, pitchers are throwing the ball harder and their stuff is getting nastier. On the hitting side, hitters are swinging the bat faster, hitting the ball harder, and making better swing decisions. From a systems perspective, test-retest feedback loops are getting tighter and department resources aren’t being dominated by repetitive processing and analyzing tasks. Efficient systems will allow us to scale our assessment process to new facilities, like our recently opened complex in Phoenix, Arizona, and any contracts/mobile assessments we do for facilities, schools, and orgs.
And we can’t wait for Summer ‘23.

If you have biomechanics data and want us to help you make the most of it, give us a shout.

Breaking New Ground: How Major League Teams Are Leveraging In-Game Biomechanics Data - Driveline Baseball,2022-10-27T15:47:24+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/10/breaking-new-ground-how-major-league-teams-are-leveraging-in-game-biomechanics-data/,"Biomechanics used to be hard. Well, it’s still hard, but it used to be harder.
In order to collect traditional marker-based motion capture data–like the kind we’ve done at Driveline–there are a host of hoops to jump through. You need skilled technicians who know how to apply markers to the athletes. You need to have the athletes strip down to just their compression shorts for the session. You have to clean and process the data. You’re limited to only collecting biomechanics data in a controlled environment. In many cases you have to spend six figures on the equipment alone. Overall it’s an invasive and time-consuming process.
With the advent of markerless biomechanics technologies like Hawk-Eye and KinaTrax, a lot of those issues are a thing of the past. Now you just have to click the record button and boom – biomechanics data.
Today, biomechanics labs are commonplace in training facilities. MLB teams are building fully swagged out biomechanics labs left and right. Every week it seems like there’s a new company that can capture biomechanics data.
We’re a long way away from the early 2000s when basically only ASMI was doing anything with biomechanics in baseball.
Markerless biomechanics also allows something especially valuable–the ability to capture in-game biomechanics data. No more markers means we can get biomechanics data on athletes in competition environments. Every game, every pitch.
Data collection has gotten easier by orders of magnitude, but one element still remains incredibly difficult: interpreting the data.
Biomechanics data is inherently complicated. The biomechanics vernacular isn’t super approachable to your everyday coach. What even is “shoulder horizontal abduction” or “trunk lateral tilt”? Describing how a player moves in biomechanical terms just isn’t easy.
So besides making some sweet visualizations, what can you actually do with that in-game biomechanics data?
#MLBFieldVision — Albert Pujols, 700 home runs pic.twitter.com/4DgLvjV8L4
The first thing you can do with in-game biomechanics data is to monitor how a player is moving over time. How are their mechanics changing from game-to-game, outing-to-outing?
Adam Wainwright had a great tweet-thread on how his mechanics changed towards the end of the season and how those changes affected his performance. Namely, he unknowingly shortened his stride length which caused a host of other issues in his delivery.
Want to clear a few things up as I didn't pitch like I wanted to down the stretch and feel the need to explain.  On Aug 28th I was hit in the knee by a comebacker against Atlanta. Without knowing it, after that game my stride length got shorter by almost a foot. Timing was thrown
With in-game biomechanics data, you have the ability to quantitatively monitor these trends on a day-to-day basis. No more eyeballing video side-by-side. You have hard data immediately after the game on how a player’s mechanics are trending, and if something needs to be done about it..
Another example: what if a pitcher was throwing harder and absolutely shoving earlier in the year, but now his velo has dropped and he’s struggling?
By comparing his last outing to previous outings when he was dialed in, you can quickly identify whether his mechanics have changed. What if his arm action has changed? What if he’s just not moving as fast? What if he’s changed the way he loads on his back leg?
Take the two graphs below, for example. Can you tell how this pitcher changed the way he loaded his backside in his last outing when his velocity was down? He exhibited decreased lateral pelvis tilt (left graph; yellow line) and decreased back hip flexion (right graph; green line) during his stride down the mound, both symptomatic of reduced back-side loading.
Last outing in yellow, a previous outing when he sat 95+ mph in gray
These are just a couple of examples, but there are countless other situations where you can leverage in-game biomechanics data to monitor mechanics over time. How are a pitcher’s mechanics progressing as he returns from rehab? Can we automatically flag any potentially detrimental mechanical changes as the season wears on?
The best teams are already doing exactly this – identifying potentially negative mechanical changes and addressing them immediately, rather than letting them linger and potentially cause larger problems.
You can also use in-game biomechanics data to detect if a pitcher is pitching his tips tipping his pitches.
Cameron Grove put out an awesome tweet thread on Luis Castillo examining if he was tipping his sinker by changing the timing of his delivery.
With pose detection we can put this theory to the test! These graphs show the median position of Castillo's foot, hand and head through time with each pitch synced to the raise of his left foot. There was a clear delay when throwing a sinker. Data from starts at GABP in April https://t.co/9kKvjNStc1 pic.twitter.com/1yemDPAFQg
Or what if a pitcher changes his set position he’s going to throw an off speed pitch? Mike Trout picked up on this when Elvis Peguero was doing just that.

It shouldn’t be up to your center fielder to notice this – the technology exists to automatically detect it! By looking at various biomechanical parameters across different pitch types you can sniff out when a pitcher is potentially tipping his pitches.
Notice how this pitcher’s elbow flexion and shoulder abduction are noticeably different early in the delivery when throwing a fastball vs. a slider
You can also use biomechanics data to drive player development decisions. It’s what Driveline has been doing for years.
By getting a snapshot of a player’s mechanics, you can drive their improvement. What areas of the delivery do they lack in compared to the guys who throw 95? Maybe their lead leg block could be better. Maybe their arm action could use some improvement.
Where it gets complicated is what you actually do about those things. Maybe there’s a drill you think will drive those positive mechanical improvements for an athlete. Maybe they need to get stronger. Maybe their physiology prevents them from getting into certain positions. At Driveline, we have a set of metrics that we’ve found correlate strongest to pitching velocity and swing velocity, which we then use to prescribe drills and exercises. We pair that with our strength and physical therapy assessments to plot the best path forward for each athlete.
After a training block we reassess to see how the athlete’s mechanics have improved, and most importantly, if their performance improved. Then we pick out the next mechanical deficiency to focus on. Rinse and repeat. As the player’s performance improves, i.e. they’re throwing or hitting the ball harder, we learn more and more about the player’s ideal mechanics.
Initial assessment in red, retest in green
Markerless motion capture not only drives these insights, it enables them to be captured more frequently, and in the actual competitive environment. You no longer need to sacrifice training time to perform in a lab setting to get retest data. Markerless tech puts the biomechanics test-retest loop in the background, where it should be.
But in professional baseball, you don’t just get the athletes you get. You get to pick the players in your organization. This leads us to another use-case for in-game biomechanics data…
Teams scout for players based on their TrackMan data all the time, so why can’t they use biomechanics data too?
An example: you find a pitcher who scores low in the biomechanics evaluation has also had poor performance on the field. In his biomechanics data you see that he doesn’t have a great arm action — and you’re confident that that’s something you can clean up. Maybe that pitcher then picks up a couple of extra ticks on his fastball. You just turned that previously under-valued player into a potential prospect.
Poor biomechanical scores and poor performance present an opportunity for clear improvement.
Or what if you’re looking to make a splash in the off-season and sign a big ticket free agent. You can check that not only does that player have good performance on the field, but he scores high in the biomechanics assessment.
High performance and high biomechanical scores means you can sign a large-ticket free agent with confidence.
One way to visualize this is to bucket all of the metrics into what areas of the body they correspond to, and compare the player against the rest of the league. How does his arm action stack up against the best of the best? How about his lower half? How fast does he move?
These situations can be extrapolated out to any number of scenarios — potential trade targets, draft targets, and so on.
It’s another tool in the toolkit to find undervalued talent.
Ethan Moore wrote a great article about The Future of the MLB R&D Department, which you should definitely go read. While his post focuses on the bigger picture of how an R&D department can have greater upside, he does list some initiatives that teams can target in order to see better returns. One of which is to evaluate new data.
Biomechanics data isn’t entirely new, but the ability to collect it in-game, at scale, is new. The teams that can not only leverage these insights but effectively translate them to coaches and players will have a big leg up on the competition.
What if Adam Wainwright was able to find his mechanical flaw after the first start it appeared and was able to immediately fix it in his next start?
How many otherwise lackluster prospects have clear mechanical deficiencies that can be cleaned up and turned into future big leaguers?
The same way that bat and ball tracking technology revolutionized the way that teams scout and develop players, so too will biomechanics data. With the proliferation of in-game biomechanics technologies, the era of biomechanics isn’t coming – it’s already here.

A Quantitative Analysis of the Lead Leg Block and its Contributions to Velocity - Driveline Baseball,2022-10-17T16:03:50+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/10/a-quantitative-analysis-of-the-lead-leg-block-and-its-contributions-to-velocity/,"Throughout this post we’ll take a closer look at various aspects of the lead leg block in pitching, looking through our biomechanics database to better describe how the lead leg block works to enable pitchers to throw harder. To briefly summarize the main findings:
-Athletes with more knee extension after foot plant throw harder (even within their own throws) on average.
-Athletes with more COG deceleration after foot plant throw harder on average
-COG deceleration correlates with front knee extension somewhat
-The block driving faster or more total pelvis rotation after footplant does not distinguish harder and softer throwers
-Both max vertical and anterior/posterior Ground Reaction Forces correlate with velocity – with the direction of that max force varying by athlete and not being a significant driver on average of pitch velocity
– Most of the relevant lead leg positions at footplant do not correlate notably with pitch velocity or the quality of the block.
With our last blog on the lead leg block being from 2015, we’ve since integrated our biomechanics lab into our training process for all athletes training in-gym and collected thousands of throws. We have a unique collection of high fidelity data with a plethora of pitchers from various skill levels and velocities up to 100mph in the dataset to analyze what the hardest throwers do well – which then informs our training processes.
We have touched on blocking briefly in other blogs since then, such as our initial SPM blog, however we’re dedicating space here to digging in with more detail- as well as examining the database with the throwers who’ve assessed in the lab since then. We are looking at various discrete metrics here, so this won’t be as sophisticated technically as the full signal analysis in the SPM blog, but is sufficient to address a variety of specific questions and hypotheses of interest.
We investigate three major kinematic components of blocking: knee extension, linear center of gravity velocity deceleration, and pelvis rotation. Then we’ll review our force plate data to consider the ground reaction forces. To wrap up, we consider how a pitcher’s landing position at foot-plant factors into how well an athlete is able to block across the kinematic components considered.
How important is extending the front knee?
To define knee extension, we look at the angle of the front knee at foot-plant and at ball release and calculate the difference between them. A positive value indicates that the knee extends from FP to BR.
Comparing the throws from each athlete with a repeated measures correlation, we get a moderately strong (in the context of biomechanics correlations to velocity being fairly low across the board) correlation of r = 0.29. This is pretty similar to the r = 0.27 comparing front knee extension and velocity between different throwers. That is, both athletes who extend their knee more throw harder than athletes who extend their knees less and athletes throw harder when they extend their knee more on specific throws of theirs – on average.
A couple examples to illustrate what this looks like:
Gains 34° of knee extension.
Loses 6° of extension.
A nonlinear model fits the data better,  with the key insight being the steep drop off at the low end – which is to say that athletes who sink into a lot more flexion at BR relative to where they were at FP have the most to gain by improving. At the high end, it does trend up again slightly, which seems to be driven by a couple athletes who throw moderately hard with the most knee extension.
If extending the knee is good, does that mean flexing the knee at the start is especially bad?
For this, we looked at the most flexed position an athlete reaches between foot plant and ball release and looked at how much more flexed this was relative to the knee angle at foot-plant – to consider how bad it is to sink into the lead leg more after foot-plant.
This is strongly related to how much the athlete’s able to extend their knee between FP and BR- which should come as no surprise (with extension being the inverse of flexion and us considering a portion of the same time period).
Put another way, if you leak into more flexion after foot-plant, it’s tougher to have your knee get more extended than it was at footplant. This makes sense, since we’re measuring extension against the value at foot-plant, so if you sink into 5 degrees of additional flexion in the time right after foot-plant, you now have less time to extend the knee before ball release and you have an additional 5 degrees you need to extend through just to get back to the starting point – much less get more extended.
A couple examples illustrating how sinking into more flexion can differ from the extension from FP to BR to illustrate what each specifically looks like on its own, though they are generally related to each other.
Visual for what not gaining flexion looks like (-0.78°)  – with minimal extension from FP to BR (7°)
Visual for what gaining flexion looks like (-12°)  – with extension from FP to BR (16°)
Looking at the relationship between sinking into additional flexion with velocity, we see a weaker trend than with using knee extension from FP to BR – with most of the observed trend being that it’s bad to sink into a lot of flexion (plot below). This relationship is notably weaker than for extension especially intra-subject where the r = 0.13 as opposed to 0.29. That is, looking at an athlete’s throws individually, the ones where they extend their knees more tend to correspond to the ones they threw harder more strongly than the ones where they sink into more flexion do – though there is a weak relationship for sinking into flexion as well.
Given the relationship between extending the knee from FP to BR and sinking into additional flexion after FP, it makes sense to ask if adding in how much flexion an athlete sinks into affects their velo after you account for the effect it has on their total amount of extension that they gain. If we throw them in a combined multiple regression model, we see only a marginal gain in model fit relative to the model with just the difference in knee extension angle (r^2 = 10.34 vs 10.21), suggesting that the relationship above between avoiding sinking into flexion and throwing harder is related to how avoiding sinking into more flexion makes it easier to extend the knee more – or some shared mechanism that affects both – rather than some additional value it may provide on its own.
To apply that interpretation, if you sink into lots of flexion, it’s going to make it incredibly difficult to extend your knee at all. However, if you sink into a little bit of flexion – but are able to extend your knee (like the second example from above), that’s likely less cause for concern and likely preferable to holding the same angle the entire time from foot-plant to ball-release.
Additionally, heavier pitchers (r = -0.15) and pitchers who move faster (r = -0.21) both on average sink into very slightly more flexion which is also interesting to observe.
Well what about how fast you extend your knee?
To touch on front knee extension angular velos as well, we start with the three most commonly calculated points: at foot-plant, at ball release, and the max value.
Max Front Knee Extension Angular Velocity and Front Knee Extension Angular Velocity at BR are strongly correlated with each other – so are likely redundant.
Both max and at BR correlate decently with velocity – and are similar in strength in regards to correlation with velocity (r = 0.25 inter-subject, r = 0.20 intra-subject).
Thus, these likely provide some information and are useful for assessing blocks, and either one could be used interchangeably.  Athletes who have larger differences between the two – who peak their knee extension velo before BR – don’t on average throw notably harder or slower (r = -0.065 with velocity).
Looking at front knee extension angular velo at foot-plant (how quickly they’re extending their knee as they plant their foot) – we see a much weaker relationship (r = 0.05 intra- and inter- subject). A quadratic fit is a smidge better (where extending or flexing the knee rapidly going into foot-plant are both not optimal) – but even so, still fairly weak to the point that I wouldn’t put much weight on it.
Note that this is weakly correlated with some of the other front knee metrics discussed above: r = ~0.2 with front knee extension from FP to BR (inter- and intra- athlete), r – ~0.15 with max front knee extension angular velo (inter- and intra-athlete), r = 0.13 inter- and r=-0.01 intra with front knee extension angular velo at br. Which is to say that it does relate some to those other measures – which may be part of why it has a small amount of predictive power.
A couple examples to illustrate how front knee extension angular velo at FP can differ from front knee extension from foot-plant to ball-release to show what it’s specifically measuring:
Gains 35° of extension but from -238°/sec ext velo at FP
Gains 35° of extension but from -238°/sec ext velo at FP
How important is decelerating center of gravity movement towards the plate?
After looking at a new lead leg block measurement that I was toying with last week, I wanted to take a peek at what an 'Efficient' block looked like. Out of the 10 best throws in our current database ranked by Block Efficiency, this athlete threw 8 of them pic.twitter.com/ZBjBQ5Pj4y
.@darenw inspired me (as he has with many in sports) with his animated visualsHere's the relationship between a lead leg block metric I'm looking at and FB velocity. I'm calling this 'Block Efficiency.' It's basically how much drive the pitcher stops with their block pic.twitter.com/5sfzC7hp8H
Another main component of the block is decreasing linear momentum and transferring that energy up the chain. Following on Kyle Lindley’s idea for a change in momentum metric , we calculated a metric for the change in COG velocity in the direction between the rubber and the plate, from its max to the minimum value between FP and BR.
Note that we see a trend where athletes who move down the mound faster are able to decelerate more – since they have a greater peak value to work off of. We can control for this relationship and get how much a particular athlete slows down their COG relative to how much we’d expect given their peak COG. This is pretty similar to the percentage metric Lindley first calculated – though we take residuals rather than using a ratio to avoid the assumptions ratios require, and don’t multiply by weight to avoid introducing any explanatory power since heavier athletes will on average throw harder.
You could hypothesize that stopping COG immediately after foot-plant is the most important and looking all the way up till ball-release is a relatively long time period to look at. If we look at only the first half of the window from FP to BR (so if, as an example, FP is at frame 220 and BR is at 240, looking at frames 220-230) to get an idea of how quickly athletes slow their COG shortly after foot-plant, this metric is less predictive of velocity (r = 0.15 inter-athlete and r = 0.04 intra-athlete).
That metric for COG difference during the whole period from FP to BR does relate some with front knee extension – though notably not perfectly. As you can see in the plots below, for a specific front knee extension value there’s a spread in terms of the COG difference metric:
A couple examples showing how these don’t always line-up (that I thought were interesting):
Knee extension of 6, but has the top value in terms of killing max COG velo- residual of 0.6.
Front knee extension of 36, but COG decel residual  of -0.32 which is  towards the lower end.
Note that ideally we’d separate out the deceleration of the COG of the lower half from the upper half. With the COG being the average weight position of all segments, this metric doesn’t account for athletes who slow down their lower half and use that to propel their upper half towards the target more than others (as the examples above illustrate).
How important is finishing Pelvis Rotation and increasing Pelvis Rotational Velo after Foot-plant?
The third major component of the block that is often talked about (along with converting the linear momentum up the chain, and the knee extending) is driving/finishing rotation of the pelvis:
To investigate this, we look at how much the pelvis rotates between foot plant and ball release (so pelvis angle at BR – pelvis angle at FP) – which does not notably relate to pitch velo (r = -0.07 inter- and r = 0.10 intra-athlete).
Note that this is strongly related with pelvis rotation at foot-plant (plot below). That is athletes who land with a more closed pelvis on average rotate their pelvis more between foot-plant and ball release. Controlling for this relationship (to look at athletes who rotate their pelvis more than we’d expect given their pelvis rotation at footplant) doesn’t strengthen the relationship with velocity (r = -0.06 inter- and r= 0.10 intra-athlete again).
Looking at pelvis rotational velo rather than just the positions, we compared pelvis rotational velo at FP with the max after FP (technically 1 frame after to avoid any overlap for people who only decelerate after) up to BR.
We see a small portion (7.8%) of athletes who’s max pelvis rotational velo after FP is no greater than their pelvis rotational velo at FP, with guys on average increasing their pelvis rotational velo by 136°/sec from FP to their max before BR.
This does not correlate notably with velo (r = -0.07 inter-subject and r = -0.01 intra-subject)
This does relate moderately with pelvis rotation at FP – where guys who have more closed pelvises at foot plant gain more pelvis rotational velo by ball release (some of which may be coming from having slower rotating pelvises at FP and some from having a larger arc to accelerate through).
To provide a couple visual examples of what outlier pelvis rotational velo gains look like – for reference:
Pelvis Rot Velo Gain of 425 – 98th percentile
Pelvis Rot Velo Gain of -36 – 1st percentile
We can similarly look at front hip internal rotation positional changes and front hip internal rotation velo since that captures rotation around the front hip that may provide more context in regards to femur positioning than just looking at global pelvis rotation, but we get similarly weak and non-notable results for change in front hip IR from BR to FP (r = 0.007 inter- and r = 0.09 intra-athlete) and max hip ir velo from between FP and BR (r = -0.03 inter- and r= 0.01 intra-athlete).
How should we weigh the different components when evaluating blocks given that there’s some overlap between them?
All that being said – how should we account for those different components when evaluating a block? To answer this question we built a multiple regression model predicting velocity taking in the variables from the different components of blocking. This allows us to calculate the best linear formula for predicting velocity using different variables. Thus, it provides a way to calculate how we’d expect different variables to contribute to velocity while controlling for the other input variables, and therefore identify what unique information each variable offers.
With Front Knee Extension from FP to BR and the COG decel metric correlating the most with velocity on their own, it’s not surprising that they provided the largest increase in model explanatory power. Adding front knee extension angular velo at BR and the max value on top of these two didn’t increase performance – so it seems that the information those would add is already captured in those two initial metrics. Similarly, we also tested out adding pelvis rotation related metrics to see if they would show up as more notable when controlling for the effect of the other components of blocking, and it still came up as not adding much.
Looking at the top blocks by this combined metric (hereby dubbed the composite block metric), we see the top performers are those with the most lead knee extension with some guys getting a bit more credit because they slow down their COG more effectively, though they also straighten their knees decently as well.
Top composite block score
2nd highest
8th best, which this pitcher achieves by having elite COG decel as well as good lead knee extension
How do ground reaction forces relate to those kinematic measures of the block and to velocity?
With the addition of force plates to our lab and processing pipeline, we have the ability to dissect the lead leg block even further beyond what you can pick up from video and motion capture – by looking at ground reaction forces.
While we’ve done a couple case studies before looking at force plate data such as in these blogs from 2016 and 2017; none of these have anywhere close to the sample of force plate data we’ve been able to collect with the set-up in our lab now – where we have more than 800 unique sessions with force plate data.
Looking at lead leg ground reaction force broken up into X/Y/Z components for the anterior-posterior/lateral/and vertical components, we see that the anterior-posterior and vertical components correlate to velocity with similar strength (r = 0.38 for x, and r = 0.44 for z) – whereas the y component (going between first and third) does not as strongly (r = 0.19).
However all of these are inflated by the fact that heavier athletes throw harder across the sample of HS/College/Pro athletes we have here – so that confounds the relationship observed here.
After we control for body-weight, the correlation for all three of the components drops off some, but the vertical and anterior-posterior components winds up in a similar neighborhood to what we observed for the key kinematic measures of the lead leg block (r = 0.19 for x, r = 0.23 for z, r = 0.1 for y – and r = 0.25 for the max magnitude considering all three components).
Looking at some of the force plate data we’ve collected (n = 1043 throws) at @DrivelineBB, we see max rear and lead leg horz and vert GRFs correlate to pitch speed about as strongly as key kinematic measures (r = 0.2-0.25) across a similar sample. Two examples of those GRFs. 1/6 pic.twitter.com/sz4VEG2JiZ
An interesting result here is that the X and Z components both correlate with similar strength to velocity – whereas some of the previous literature had found the X component to matter more – in smaller samples. If we consider the direction of the force (where 90 degrees is all vertical force, and 0 degrees is all horizontal force with no vertical component), we see no correlation to velo. That is, on average there does not seem to be a general recommendation for what angle you should aim to put force into the ground across all athletes, but merely that putting more force into the ground with your lead leg is better.
Comparing the max Lead Leg force into the ground with the Block Composite Score calculated from the different kinematic areas we see that they are correlated, but that correlation isn’t all that high in context of what you might expect (r = 0.26). Which is to say that the kinematic measures give us some idea of the force put into the ground, but there’s more detail that we’re able to get at leveraging the force plates that doesn’t show up in the kinematic measures – giving us another measure tool for assessing and diagnosing athlete’s training needs.
With the force plates in our lab at @DrivelineBB, we see athletes who extend their lead knee faster after foot-plant typically put more force into the ground (good example of both those in pitcher 3 here), but we do see some variance in regards to that (pitchers 1-2 here). 1/3 pic.twitter.com/aYAYECeS7c
How does landing positioning affect this composite block metric and the different blocking metrics?
The table above shows the inter-subject (comparing different athletes) and intra-subject (comparing throws from each athlete) correlations comparing different metrics of interest for blocking with foot-plant positioning metrics. Relationships I think may be of interest highlighted in orange. The relationships between these various landing position metrics and our composite block metric are all very weak – which suggests to me that landing position is not the primary determinant of an athlete’s blocking ability.
We considered 4 positional metrics at foot-plant – front knee flexion, front ankle dorsi/plantar flexion, pelvis rotation, and hip internal/external rotation. For each of these, I took a look at how they compared to ball velo, the composite block metric, detailed above, and then front knee extension from FP to BR, front knee flexion from FP to the min after FP, COG decel after FP, and Max Front Knee Extension Angular Velo which were the main metrics discussed above.
First we consider the angle of the knee at foot-plant, since it’d seem that how this angle is initially set would significantly affect how the block works. Quick visual demonstration of the variability we see:
35° on left (3rd percentile)                                                                        68° on right (98th percentile)
Thus a larger number is a more flexed knee at foot-plant. Most of the relationships come back as non-notable when combining the inter- and intra- athlete analysis.
The one relationship that is notable in both is the relationship between front knee flexion and sinking into additional flexion after foot-plant – we get r = 0.26 comparing different session-level averages per athlete and r = 0.2 comparing all throws within each athlete.
This relationship indicates that having a more bent knee at foot-plant leads to sinking into flexion less after foot-plant. That might seem counterintuitive at first, but as the knee is already more bent, it’s less likely to bend even more. Furthermore, it’s possible that the athlete has a particular joint angle that they’re stronger in – so by landing in a more flexed position – that could theoretically be more advantageous for extending out of.
Front ankle dorsi/plantar flexion is going to be decently related to front knee flexion angle (r = 0.40), but I thought it would be interesting to consider as well, since they don’t line up 100%.
Ankle dorsiflexion at 59°                                                   Ankle dorsiflexion at 91°
Here, most of the relationships come back non-notable, so it doesn’t seem to be a huge determiner of someone’s ability to block, especially since there’s no notable correlation to ball velo or the composite block metric.
After looking at the lead leg positions specifically, we consider pelvis rotation (axially, so omitting anterior/posterior tilt and lateral tilt of the pelvis in this analysis) next – as if the pelvis is open enough is often considered a factor in blocking ability.
A quick visual at high and low pelvis rotation numbers to illustrate:
Pelvis Angle at 15°                                                                        Pelvis Angle at 65°
There’s a negligible relationship between pelvis rotation at FP and ball velo (r = 0.08 between-athlete, r = 0.02 within-athlete) and pelvis rotation at FP and the composite block metric (r = -0.04 inter-athlete, and r = 0.03 intra-athlete) – which immediately qualifies the importance of having the pelvis open at foot-plant for blocking. If getting the pelvis open was a prerequisite for being able to block, you’d expect harder throwers and better blockers to get their pelvis more open – which on average they do not.
We do see that athletes who land with more open pelvises on average sink less into flexion after footplant (as well as intra-subject – where athletes sink less into flexion after foot-plant on throws where their pelvis is more open). The correlations here are the strongest of any of these landing position correlations  (r = 0.34 inter-, and r= 0.45 intra-subject). By landing with the pelvis more open, an athlete may avoid sinking into more flexion but in the process also reduce the amount of time they have for their leg to impart force into the ground before ball release – and thus just be trading off sinking into a little bit of flexion at the expense of having time to put force into the ground.
If someone is sinking into a lot of flexion and not getting any extension, it’s possible that opening the pelvis more up may help, by affording them less time to do so – but I don’t think that fully addresses the issue of lack of extension given the lack of a relationship between pelvis angle and throwing harder or blocking better (as measured by the composite block score)
Last one on the docket is Hip IR/ER. It  is a bit more subtle in terms of being able to see it than the other landing position metrics. We have a couple athletes with more extreme values to illustrate:
Low Hip IR/ER at FP of -25°                                            High Hip IR/ER at FP of 46
°
This metric is looking at the rotation of the front femur relative to the pelvis. When looking for it, you can see the athlete on the left have his femur turned inwards in relation to the pelvis as opposed to the athlete on the right who has his turned out.
We see more Hip ER at FP related to sinking into more flexion after FP, and getting less extension of the knee between FP and BR. From looking at athletes with extreme hip ER values (screenshots below) – we can see how being more externally rotated may put an athlete in a disadvantageous position to be able to extend the knee. Nonetheless, as with the other landing position metrics, Hip ER at FP doesn’t relate notably to throwing harder or blocking better in general, so this may be a possible option to explore with athletes with extreme ER, but isn’t something that necessarily weighs heavily when evaluating and troubleshooting an athlete’s blocking ability.
The ability to analyze mechanics from all the pitchers who have come through the lab allows us to rigorously test out a variety of hypotheses to determine what distinguishes hard throwers from slower throwers. We see our hard throwers extending their knees more and faster, putting more force into the ground vertically and horizontally, and slowing their center of gravity down more than the slower throwers on average.
Thus, checking out knee extension provides a valuable check-point when considering an athlete’s mechanics – which relates to the athletes ability to slow down their body and transfer that energy up the chain and put force into the ground. We don’t see the quality of the lead leg block being dictated by the position an athlete lands in – suggesting that the lead leg block is a skill/movement that likely needs to be trained (with drills like rockers, roll-ins and drop-steps) – and won’t necessarily address itself completely just by changing how an athlete moves into foot-plant.
While we’ve aimed to be thorough here, there’s always more areas to investigate. We touched on force plate components in this analysis, but there’s further analysis on the timing of ground reaction forces and the relationship between putting force into the ground and how that coincides with different movements. Besides that, the role of strength and mobility on blocking ability is often talked about and would be interesting to discuss here, but that’s an analysis for another time.

Hitting Biomechanics - Driveline Baseball,2022-09-28T20:41:19+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/09/hitting-biomechanics/,"Bat Speed, Point of Contact, and Rotational Velocities
Since finalizing the hitting set-up in our motion capture lab (The Launchpad) in July of 2021, we’ve had hundreds of hitters come in for a motion capture assessment, including multiple MLB All Stars and top collegiate and pro prospects. At the time of writing, Driveline has collected biomechanical data on over 2,000 swings across a wide range of player talent from high schoolers up to some of the best hitters in the MLB.
Screw it, let's do a hitting biomechanics breakdown thread 🧵In the last year we've done over 300+ hitting mocaps ranging from HS Gatorade player of the year nominees all the way up to Silver Slugger award winners and former MVPs.We've got some DUDES in there pic.twitter.com/lzggCN13jM
This gives us a rich and unique database to help us answer the question: what separates the best hitters in the world from their peers?
Countless books could be written on all the challenges we’ve encountered and the failures we’ve made getting to this point; however, from those lessons we find ourselves well positioned to leverage our growing database and the hitting biomechanics insights are beginning to trickle in. So let’s take a look at a few quick ones!
One of the coolest aspects of hitting motion capture is that we are able to collect all sorts of high-fidelity, full signal data on bat characteristics during the swing. For example, we are able to see what a hitter’s bat speed or attack angle is at any given point in the swing (see figures 1 and 2). This gives our trainers a full picture of what an athlete is doing rather than needing to rely on discrete metrics at impact to infer swing and path quality.
Figure 1. Full signal bat speed data showing how fast the sweet spot of the bat is moving at every point in the swing.
Figure 2. Full signal attack angle data can give a better idea of a hitter’s bat path throughout the entirety of the swing.
Using tools like Blast Motion bat sensors on a daily basis gives us immediate feedback during a training session, but swinging in the Launchpad allows for greater precision and detail. Much of the guesswork that comes from looking at video can be removed, helping our trainers more precisely pinpoint what a hitter does well and what they need to improve.
The precision of the lab also means we can obtain more consistent reads on things like bat speed or attack angle and full signal body + bat kinematics, while avoiding variance due to incorrect sensor placement. This last point can be seen by looking at the differences in the standard deviations of paired bat speeds measured with Blast and our mocap lab. These differences may not look huge at first glance, but when you consider that these values were calculated after removing any obvious misreads from Blast, the differences appear pretty eye-opening.
We’ve already talked quite a bit about the importance of bat speed in several blogs authored in the past, and in the table below one can see that our results from the Launchpad provide even more evidence as to why this is the case.
We see that, on average, our pro hitters swing the bat just under 72 mph, which is about 4 mph faster than our college hitters and almost 10 mph faster than our high school hitters. Not surprisingly, our pro hitters also hit the ball about 6 mph harder than our college hitters in the lab and about 12 mph harder than our high school hitters on average.
We can also see from the distributions below that there is much less variability in bat speed and exit velocity among professional hitters when compared to both college and high school hitters. The key takeaway here is that as batters move up in playing level, they must swing the bat faster and hit the ball harder than a certain threshold.
HitTrax and similar technologies define POC as the point where contact is made relative to home plate. While this metric does provide a lot of useful information, it does have some limitations due to the fact that not every hitter stands in the exact same spot in the batter’s box or has the same length stride. This can make it a bit tougher to compare one hitter’s POC to another’s. So what if we were able to measure POC relative to a hitter’s body?
Using our motion capture data we can use a hitter’s center of gravity (COG) to determine how far out in front or deep in the zone contact is made relative to that hitter’s body. We can simply calculate the distance between a hitter’s COG position and the position of the sweet spot of their bat to get what we will refer to as their MoCap POC (figure 5).
Every hitter knows the feeling of hitting a ball too deep in the zone or too far out in front and will be able to tell you that these different swings are going to yield much different results. For example, this is a swing from our lab with one of the deepest points of contact:
Compare that to another swing from our lab which had the furthest POC in our database:
These two swings are going to result in much different spray and launch angles and, as we will see shortly, would likely have much different bat speeds.
Because hitting is so reaction-based and largely dependent on the incoming pitch, we expect there to be much more variation from swing to swing. Measuring POC relative to the body gives us one way to compare similar swings across different athletes.
When looking at POC across different levels of play we see an interesting trend where POC increases with playing level. The plot below shows the distribution of POC split up by playing level.
High school hitters tend to make contact almost 12 cm (or about 5 inches) deeper in the zone relative to their body when compared to professional hitters. However, this may not be a generalizable trend that we would observe outside of our lab. During motion capture assessments, we set up the pitching machine 45 feet from home at a standard setting of 65 mph. One possible explanation is that it is marginally easier for hitters at higher levels to hit against these settings than lower level hitters and, thus, why we see POC increase with playing level.
Nevertheless, we see that, on average, POC gets slightly farther out in front as you go up in playing level. Whether this is a result of us controlling the difficulty of the incoming pitch or not is hard to say, but it’s likely that this trend doesn’t hold in the same way in more game-like settings at different levels of play.
Ask any hitter and most will tell you it’s much easier to hit a home run to the pull-side than to the opposite field. Taking a look at POC and its relationship to bat speed gives us some insight into why it may be easier to hit the ball harder to the pull-side.
Hitting a ball to the pull-side requires a POC that is farther out in front of the body than hitting a ball to the opposite field. This will likely result in a slightly higher bat speed than if contact was made deeper in the zone. When we plot MoCap POC against bat speed we see that there is a positive linear relationship where bat speed increases with POC when comparing swings from different hitters (figure 9).
This relationship intuitively makes sense as the bat has more time to accelerate the farther out in front contact happens. When we control for a player’s average bat speed and average point of contact – to further tease out the expected effect if an athlete were to make contact further out in front on some of their swings – we see that this trend remains where an increase in POC is associated with an increase in bat speed.
Using that relationship plotted in figure 10, an additional 10 cm (~4 inches) of POC corresponds with an increase of approximately 0.6 mph for that athlete. Now, this isn’t necessarily to say that everyone should be trying to make contact as far out in front as possible to maximize their bat speed. In fact, there are going to be trade-offs with making contact farther out in front such as a higher attack angle (see figure 11).
Motion capture allows us to not only track the movement of the bat during a swing, it also allows us to track different segments of the body and see how they may influence the swing. One of the more common ways to determine how efficiently a player moves during a swing is to look at how fast and in what sequence they rotate their body. We typically look at the angular velocity of the pelvis, torso, upper arm, and hand to get an idea of how well a hitter uses their entire kinetic chain to create bat speed. Ideally a hitter will have a sequence that looks something like this:
We see here that the segment velocities peak in order as we move up the chain from the pelvis, to the torso, to the arm, and to the hands. In this way, each subsequent body segment builds off of the velocity that was generated by the previous segment. For more context, the visuals below demonstrate exactly what we are looking for when we talk about angular velocities of different body segments sequencing efficiently:
Figure 13. Pelvis angular velocity measures how quickly the pelvis (highlighted segment) rotates during the swing.
Figure 14. Torso angular velocity measures how quickly the torso (highlighted segment) rotates during the swing.
Figure 15. Upper arm angular velocity measures how quickly the upper arm (highlighted segment) rotates during the swing.
Figure 16. Hand angular velocity measures how quickly the hand (highlighted segment) rotates during the swing.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a relatively straightforward observation we’ve been able to make with the data we’ve collected in The Launchpad is that rotating faster is correlated to swinging the bat faster and hitting the ball harder. The table below shows a handful of rotational velocity metrics and their relationship to both bat speed and exit velocity:
All six of these rotational velocity metrics are significantly correlated to both bat speed and exit velocity at contact. Thus, the faster these segments rotate, the faster the bat moves and the harder the ball is hit.
Interestingly, the relationship between rotational velocity and bat speed / exit velocity gets stronger the further one moves up the chain (or toward the bat). So, it may be possible for an athlete to overcome slower pelvis and torso rotational velocities with higher arm and hand speeds later in the swing to generate bat speed.
Another interesting takeaway from this table is that max pelvis angular velocity has a weaker  correlation to bat speed and exit velocity than pelvis angular velocity at foot plant. In other words, it may be more important that the pelvis is moving quickly as a hitter lands with their lead leg than it is to max out pelvis rotational velocity at any other point during the swing.
To get a sense of just how fast hitters in our lab are moving, take a look at the table below. In doing so, you’ll see that the correlations discussed above seem to hold true when looking across all playing levels.
Just like with bat speed, we see that rotational velocities appear to increase with playing level with larger differences in arm and hand speeds.
With our initial foray into hitting biomechanics, we confirmed some of the more basic hypotheses related to the fundamentals of hitting. Better hitters swing harder, make louder contact, live further out in-front when hitting pitches of equal difficulty, and rotate faster / more efficiently. With these truths supported, we’ll leverage The Launchpad to help us investigate questions and quantify mechanical characteristics we were previously unable to. A primary point of interest in our future research will be in understanding and quantifying what makes for an efficient and optimal bat path. Along with this we hope to learn more about how different mechanical attributes influence batted ball outcomes. Stay tuned for more insights into hitting biomechanics as we dive deeper and deeper into the data!
Great data. Do you mind if I make a suggestion? A summary of points along with action items that the reader could implement based on your finding.
That said, the takeaway I have is:
-Work on speed and moving fast
– improve strength and rotational abilities
-when possible, hit the ball out in front of the plate as it allows time for bat speed to pick up
Anything I missed?
Figure 1 (attack angle graph) is the most interesting to me here.  Looks like you feel the same way with your conclusion statement “A primary point of interest in our future research will be in understanding and quantifying what makes for an efficient and optimal bat path”.  If an athlete’s goal is to match attack angle with the reverse incoming pitch angle, looks like the attack angle accelerates to that angle within milliseconds. How to train for that?  We will see what you find.

"A Look Under the Hood: How Driveline Sport Science Collects, Processes, and Analyzes Thousands of Athletes’ Biomechanics Data - Driveline Baseball",2022-09-14T16:41:25+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/09/a-look-under-the-hood-how-driveline-sport-science-collects-processes-and-analyzes-thousands-of-athletes-biomechanics-data/,"Driveline Baseball has long been baseball’s applied biomechanics leader. Since 2008, when founder Kyle Boddy started building his first motion capture lab in the aisles of Home Depot, Driveline has leveraged the value of objectively quantifying human movement.
The lab has improved by leaps and bounds since then. Driveline R&D has iteratively refined the technology and underlying systems in our motion capture ecosystem. Our current setup, The Launchpad, features simultaneous markered and markerless motion capture data as well as a wealth of additional tracking technologies like Rapsodo, Trackman, HitTrax, and Pulse. Gone are the days of using hacked Wiimotes to measure biomechanics (true story).
And that lab has enabled us to learn a lot of things. We’ve studied the effects of weighted baseballs on pitching mechanics, validated biomechanics technologies, and leveraged biomechanics to drive our training protocols for both hitters and pitchers.
Our Biomechanics Group has written and talked extensively on both the Driveline Blog and Driveline R&D podcast on what we do with biomechanics and accessory data once we get it. Some excellent examples include our forward dynamics and computed muscle control simulations. Less commonly talked about is how we get to the point where we’re ready to analyze our data. How do we go from raw 3D coordinates to kinematic and kinetic data that analysts, coaches, and other R&D staff can use? Additionally, how do we combine data from so many sources to enhance our insights without overtaxing staff??
In the lab, we’re always running a handful of different technologies. So how do we manage it all? As anyone who’s interfaced with multiple baseball technologies before knows all too well, each additional tool is another job for the coaches or player development staff. As the tech stacks up, the workload quickly becomes overwhelming.
Unless…
Each additional toy is another job unless you build the underlying systems to reduce the amount of human oversight needed. How do we efficiently process biomechanics data and stream it into our broader player development ecosystem?
That’s what we’ll talk about here.
Even though several technologies may be running for any given individual motion capture assessment, custom software solutions allow the Launchpad to be run by one person – though we still need another set of hands to feed the pitching machine for hitting assessments.
Proprietary Driveline software syncs our Edgertronic cameras to any Stalker radar gun enabling automatic triggering when a pitch is thrown. This eliminates the need for manual Edgertronic operation. Edgertronic clips are then synched to athletes’ TRAQ profiles and fed into our internal markerless motion capture pipeline.Rapsodo and Trackman ball tracking data are automatically uploaded to our internal databases. Visual3D and Python processing pipelines upload every pitch/swing (markered or markerless) to the same data warehouse. Joint kinetics, kinematics, energetics, and force plate data are matched on a per-pitch level while session and player-level tables provide the necessary metadata for custom data selection and filtering as needed. Custom data fidelity checks filter out any troublesome inconsistencies that ran into issues along the way.Ball tracking and full signal biomechanics data get paired on a per-pitch level. This entire process, from placing markers to generating custom reporting that populates in an athlete’s Traq profile, occurs within 24 hours of initial data collection. If we have a high priority assessment that requires an expedited turnaround time, we can manually run our processing pipelines to generate the necessary deliverables ahead of the next-day turnaround.
All of these automations free up R&D employees to do what they do best: support coaches and players, drive further insights, and continually improve the underlying systems.
Since Driveline’s first motion capture processing pipeline over a decade ago, we have been working on making biomechanics data processing as smooth as possible. Today, we are on the sixth iteration of our processing pipeline (v6) and the amount of human oversight needed to take data from assessment to applicable insight has never been lower.
We started trying to keep track of how many labor hours go into a single mocap session back in 2019. Back then, we were turning around reports in ~7 days and it was taking 5+ combined labor hours per motion capture session. Today, we do more with that biomechanics data than we ever have and during peak volumes it takes us less than 90 minutes of labor per session from end to end. This summer, there were over 500 motion capture sessions in the Launchpad and it only cost us ~600 labor hours.
without giving away the secret sauce…
Visual3D has been the leading research-grade biomechanics processing platform for several decades. We feel no other platform offers comparable options when it comes to pose estimation and linked-segment modeling. It is for these reasons that we funnel all of our markered and markerless motion capture data through Visual3D for foundational pose estimation, inverse kinematics, and inverse dynamics calculations before moving to Python and R for more intensive and application-specific signal processing.
With V6, we have used Visual3D to further fine tune our linked-segment model so that it more closely captures how our athletes move. Our updated model is less constrained, allowing segments on the distal end of large range of motion joints, such as the shoulders and hips, to move freely relative to their neighboring segment. Previously, constraining segments on opposing sides of these joints sometimes caused pose estimation problems and less accurate kinematic and kinetic profiles.
V6 houses two new data classes in addition to the traditional kinematic and kinetic data: energetics and force plates. Energy flow analyses allow us to see when, where, and how much kinetic energy is moving between body segments. Force plates tell us how our athletes are interfacing with the ground. Both of these data sources help provide a more complete picture of how athletes move during each pitch/swing.
V6 houses all our unfiltered, unprocessed motion capture data separate from the processed data. Any interested employee or client can access it and perform custom analyses for their own projects. If we want to test different filtering settings? Cool. If we want to try out a different set of model assumptions? No problem. If we want to explore a new metric derived from global kinematic/kinetic data instead of relying on typical coordinate system and rotation sequence conventions? We can.
Less invasive data collection means larger samples. With these larger samples, we can start to identify, on an individual and group level, what really matters. Paired markerless data with live-AB results drill right down to what get’s hitters out. Markerless data paired with ball tracking and per-play results allows us to analyze baseball at a level that almost didn’t seem possible just a few years ago. Want to quantify how a pitcher’s deception influences an expected run value of a pitch? We can. Want to measure how a batter adjusts to an off-speed pitch thrown in a hitter’s count? That’s possible, too.
Less labor intensive data collection also means more attention to other technologies to continue building our paired databases. The most powerful insights typically come at the intersection of sport science sub-disciplines. Less labor intensive allows us to live there, focusing more on the interplay of technique and performance.
Better systems automation and organization tightens the feedback loop between motion capture and actionable insight. No more dedicating practice time to getting markered up and transported to some separate biomechanics lab to get a baseline or a retest mocap done. Now we can do it with minimal disruption to the practice plan, and without killing R&D staff with labor-heavy data cleaning or processing. All so we can keep digging into how to improve on-field performance.

Professional Player Development: Crowd-Sourced Edition!,2022-08-02T16:07:11+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/08/professional-player-development-crowd-sourced-edition/,"On Twitter (@drivelinebases), I posted a thread with some polls about professional player development and scouting with some options – and got tons of responses! In this blog post, we’ll go over them with my opinion on each question, select key tweets from respondents who elaborated on their answers, and perhaps come up with some new questions for the next edition!
(My Twitter account auto-deletes tweets after some amount of time, so all tweets here are images clipped and posted.)
This is the question that kicked it all off:
In many professional organizations, the mantra that is literally repeated around the clubhouse and front office are:
“Wins at the minor league level do not matter – only player development matters.”
Some organizations will go so far as to say things like:
“We will never put winning above developing players.”
On its face, this makes a lot of sense – after all, the goal of the minor league systems for professional baseball is to develop their players, not necessarily win games. A trophy at Double-A doesn’t confer 2 extra wins in the big leagues, after all.
I think the majority opinion around professional baseball is a more balanced approach, where they care a little bit about minor league wins/losses, but not a whole lot. 63.8% of Twitter respondents out of 5,449 votes are in or around that bucket, with 27.3% saying that wins/losses don’t matter at all. I would say this is likely close to the split of MLB organizations’ opinions, with the devil in the details of the “Important but not primary” answer – which, for the record, is also my answer.
But as stated above, the devil truly is in the details. How important is “important but not primary?” When I was the Director of Pitching of the Cincinnati Reds, the organization cared a great deal about winning in the minor leagues, which I actually agreed with. They didn’t put it above everything, but the win/loss records mattered to them. And win we did, posting the best winning percentage in the minor leagues since 2006, and the first time over .500 in a decade.
This made me proud, because while winning is indeed a byproduct of development of your players – and our pitchers saw incredible gains from 2019-2021 – I truly believe that winning itself is an intrinsic skill. I’ve discussed this with a number of professional players and front office executives, and the easiest way to sum up what I believe about winning in the minor leagues is that winning is the only thing that matters at the big league level, and not caring about it at any level before that is setting a player up for failure – especially on a winning team.
Furthermore, many Twitter responders pointed out something relevant: It’s simply not fun to play on a losing team, knowing you’re going to show up and get your ass kicked on a daily basis. A culture of winning breeds a more friendly workplace, and makes it easier to put in that extra work for your career and the team’s benefit. It helps the coaches hold players accountable on a regular basis, and sharpens the small things in the game that get amplified on the largest stage.
Grade: Important but not primary – I agree with the Twitter poll, but lean more towards winning than I think most do.
What a race! With 3,102 votes in, the vote was essentially split amongst the Very Important and Somewhat Important poll options, with Very Important barely squeaking out the win. I was surprised at the large number of people saying “Not important at all” with 8.6%, which seems clearly incorrect.
Let me give you an example of a minor league pitcher who was/is a “non-prospect,” or “organizational player,” and his journey so far inside professional baseball. This player was a low-bonus signee who was considered to have good command but not much stuff – both the analytics and scouting department agreed with that assessment before signing the player. His fastball had a Stuff+ rating of 36, which means it was 64% worse than an average MLB fastball – seen below on The Blob tool from Driveline EDGE/TRAQ:
The pitcher’s other pitches weren’t too good either, so something had to improve, starting with his fastball – he needed to throw harder, yes, but he also needed to get his fastball out of the “dead zone,” which is where you have equal parts carry and run with small-to-mediocre values of both (some dead zone fastballs that have high velocity and lots of movement can be nasty, but that’s not the case here).
Only on Driveline PLUS
In most organizations, this pitcher would be sent out to fill innings, get shelled, and maybe reach Double-A as nothing more than someone who helps get through innings by throwing strikes. This is the fate of the organizational player – someone who is simply there so the prospects can play.
However, in this player’s case, upon signing, he entered a specific development program with the intent of improving his pitches while being held out of competition. The following year, the player had significantly improved his fastball velocity and drastically improved its shape. Once again, we’ll consult The Blob, which is what we use on a daily basis with our professional pitchers in-gym (and remote) to explain the roadmap to major league plus pitches:
Wow! His new fastball has a more four-seam true profile, with above-average carry. It’s also two ticks faster, and combined with the better ride on the pitch, has granted it a Stuff+ rating of 115, making it 15% better than a major league-average fastball, an absolute improvement of 79 Stuff+ points in a half of a season + off-season of work.
This player also developed two breaking balls that had Stuff+ ratings of about 100 each, plus a slightly below-average changeup, meaning he had one above-average major league pitch, two average major league pitches, and one slightly below-average major league pitch – with plus command from a low bonus signee.
The average draft position for a college pitcher with average major league command and three average-or-better pitches is likely in the top five rounds – meaning the organization basically got a player in the top 180 picks in exchange for a very low signing bonus and a back-end draft pick (or in his case, a non-drafted selection, meaning no pick was even needed).
Unfortunately, in 2022, this player has seen significant regression in his Stuff+ grades due to inconsistent coaching in his professional organization and outside facility training, leading to his fastball to tick down to average due to losing some carry and his hard breaking ball to turn into a sweepless cutter-type pitch, making it a tweener and one that The Blob does not particularly favor:
That’s not going to cut it (pun unintended) – this is about 20 points worse by Stuff+ than his previous equivalent breaking ball in this slot.
In a nutshell, that is the yin and yang of an organizational player – the journey from an innings filler to potential player with major league value, back on the road to a potential innings filler once again due to inconsistent player development and coaching.
So, what’s the conclusion? There’s room for a lot of opinions on the topic, even with the data above, but I say…
Grade: Very Important – I agree with the Twitter poll.
Asking if you want the best scouting or player development is a lot like asking: Do you like beer or tacos? The answer, of course, being: Both, you fool.
In this case, however, I made people choose:
A whopping 80.7% majority voted for “Elite player development,” which surprised me – though perhaps it shouldn’t, considering that most people associate me with player development (even though I got my start in scouting!) and most of my followers are probably either coaches or players and thus more closely related to player development over scouting.
When I made this poll, I wasn’t quite sure what answer I was going to go with, but I leaned towards voting for “Elite scouting,” which I am sure surprises many of you. However, after examining the question a bit more in-depth, I started to change my mind – so I’ll take you through that process.
This is generally bad for traditional scouts – technologies like Trackman, Hawkeye, Rapsodo, Blast Motion, Diamond Kinetics, TRAQ, markerless biomechanics, and so forth carry significant signal on how good a player’s tools are. As such, traditional scouts’ eyes are devalued for populations where you can draw this data from – namely, college players – and also increasingly elite prep players playing at showcases where this data is collected, in addition to the new MLB Combine.
However, there are areas where this data is unavailable – most people think international prospects, but even there you’re getting more data to put into scouting models than you’d expect, even if data on 14-15 year old players is specious at best. No, the value of traditional scouts goes way up in areas like Junior College and lesser-known high school players, where their eyes are the only source of information available. Once again, though, there’s an issue – the MLB Draft was shortened to 20 rounds, meaning there are less opportunities to sign back-end type talents, especially since domestic minor league roster spots are now limited.
Are the best scouts way better than the median scout? Absolutely, and this carries a ton of value – especially veteran scouts who build relationships with local players, coaches, and trainers to uncover intangible aspects of players that no technology can capture. However, this signal gets eroded by draft models and increasingly available quantifiable data.
Does this apply to player development?
In professional organizations, player development departments are still highly fractured – there is strong resistance in most organizations to unify under a data-driven message and run the department like a real business. Well-run organizations of all sorts take from principles found in High Output Management, The Hard Thing About Hard Things, Good to Great, and other well-regarded business books. Running a player development department has discrete inputs and outputs, and pretending otherwise doesn’t make it true – indeed, with increased quantification of player performance at the process level (rather than simply results level), managing via Key Performance Indicators and other metrics has never been more valuable.
Unfortunately, the majority of organizations reject this concept, believing that baseball is somehow immune to the forces that govern almost all other businesses and organizations worldwide. This simply isn’t true, as the organizations that consistently outproduce homegrown talent – either for their roster or for trading – have well-defined and accurate processes, strong cultures that truly lead the organization, and managers/directors with the will to enforce the culture in both gentle and harsh ways, if necessary.
Conclusion
I believe that the difference between an elite scouting department and a median scouting department is smaller than the difference between an elite player development department and a median player development department, therefore…
Grade: I would prefer an Elite player development department – I agree with the Twitter poll after changing my mind.
I knew this question was going to be a doozy…
I’ll be the first to admit I probably should have gone with the third or fourth round here over the second round, but it doesn’t change the soul of the question: Do you want elite stuff or elite command from your top draft picks?
Kyle Wasserberger from Driveline said:
I agree with the base of his answer – it’s generally easier to improve “stuff” over “command” given everything we know. However, it is not a given, and as one major league pitcher allegedly said:
“Command without stuff is batting practice.”
Ultimately it comes down to scarcity, and a 70 grade on Stuff is no joke – hard to find, even harder to develop. This is also true about 70 command, but if we scroll up to the question about Non-Prospects, you’ll see that pitchers with plus command are available later in the draft and even in the non-drafted pool. At the end of the day it’s about value for what you’re paying for, and it’s simply easier to find better command and low stuff in the later rounds of the draft than vice versa, meaning you should pay the premium for elite stuff, not command.
If neither player gets better, the pitcher with 70 stuff has a chance to pitch in the bullpen for your major league organization, and likely still retains trade value even if he doesn’t have the best performance statistics in the minor leagues. However, few organizations will trade anything of value for a 70 command pitcher with below-average stuff, making the decision…
Grade: Give me the pitcher with 70 Stuff / 30 Command – I agree with the Twitter poll.
What I had as a bit of a throwaway question ended up becoming one of the more interesting ones in the thread:
For this question, I’m going to outsource my answer to @Tieran711 on Twitter, whose response I very much agree with:
I’m sure most people expected me to vote for markerless biomechanics, and while that’s technology I’d be more than happy to have, I strongly believe that we could replace that with lower cost methods (and manual inspection of high-speed video) much easier than we could replace higher resolution data from the weight room in the form of force plates and force frames (ways to measure upper body isometrics/positions). At Driveline Baseball, our High Performance team gets surprisingly strong signal from what we call the “HP Dashboard,” which has our aggregated strength and power metrics in it, many derived from force plates and force frame-type devices.
It has become immeasurably important for our pitching coaches, and forms the foundation of the athletic programming we give our trainees to build a complete player.
Take a look at these two professional pitchers – one of them clearly dominates the spectrum of the High Performance metrics we have (we don’t have a cluster for this, he’s just elite-elite), while the other dominates the power portions, but has low marks in other areas (Cluster 2: High Power, Low Else):
Without knowing anything about their biomechanical signatures, which one do you think throws absolute gas? Right, Player 1. Player 2 is still a very good professional pitcher, but he’s not Player 1. And even if Player 2 was the better player, Player 1 has the higher ceiling to unlock via more advanced methods you’d discover via biomechanical systems.
So…
Grade: Force plates + force frames – I disagree with the Twitter poll.
The question you all knew was coming….
@HarrisFreePress on Twitter said that I inadvertently created the baseball trolley problem, so I whipped up this meme:
I’m gonna cut straight to the chase on this question: It’s not close, the answer is Yes.
The canonical study done on this topic about gaining fastball velocity comes from Mike Fast from The Hardball Times in Gain a Tick, Lose a Tick. His conclusion:
Being able to bring the heat is a very important factor in a pitcher’s success. Being able to crank it up a notch typically improves a pitcher’s run prevention abilities, and losing a notch hurts his effectiveness. Starting pitchers improve by about one run allowed per nine innings for every gain of 4 mph, and relief pitchers improve by about one run per nine innings for every gain of 2.5 mph.
In 2014, Jeff Zimmerman replicated the findings in his post on Fangraphs.
Finally, in 2019, Dan Aucoin looked into it at Driveline Baseball and – surprise, surprise – found the same results in his blog post The Value in Developing Fastball Velocity in the Minors.
The idea in this exercise is simple; we controlled for changing run environments on a year-to-year basis and found the difference between projected FBv and actual FBv (min 50 IP) as well as projected RA9 and actual RA9 for each individual pitcher at the MLB level. We expected that a pitcher who threw his fastball slower than expected in a given season would have worse outcomes than previously projected, and vice versa.
This relationship is exactly what we found over a sample of 1,838 athletes. More specifically, a pitcher who outperformed his fastball velocity projection by +1 mph produced an RA9 that was .2443 points lower than expected, on average.
The following chart illustrates the magnitude of the gain/loss:
There’s really no debate: Throwing harder than you’re expected to throw makes you a better pitcher.
Of course, that’s not the question, is it? The question revolves around the injury cases I put into the poll to make you think about it. Let’s start with how you’d ethically roll out such a program, first and foremost. You could not force minor league pitchers to take part in this program – at least, I wouldn’t do it – and as such, you have to disclose all the benefits, risks, known unknowns, and options to them ahead of time. You would tell the group of ten players everything you knew about the program, everything you know you don’t know, and things you think you might know that you don’t know, and present them with the option to sign up for the program or not.
The issue, of course, is that if they don’t sign up for the program, you have very, very strong confidence that these non-prospects are Role 0/1 players, which is a nice way of saying that they have no chance to provide major league value to the organization in any form. As such, the alternative to the program is to fill innings, or more likely, get outright released. This is also something you should disclose to the players – an honest evaluation of their present abilities and their projected inability to provide value to the major league organization.
Now, from the Pitching Coordinator and front office’s point of view, this program clearly has a lot of benefit. Two pitchers gain 2.5 MPH, which is not insignificant, one player has a minor setback, one player requires team-paid surgery on his elbow as a result of the program, and six remain in the same spot as they were before. Ideally you’d get better results, which is what many people on Twitter asked for, but that’s not answering the question – and this question indeed has a very simple answer, which is that yes, the front office should want this program to go into effect.
A 10% chance to rupture your UCL is probably quite close to minor league average “major surgery” rates, which is one of the first things you should evaluate. Therefore, how much additional risk is this program really adding? Likely, not much.
Next, all the data and information above clearly shows how valuable adding 2.5 MPH on a fastball can be for pitchers – especially if they’re in the mediocre threshold, like most non-prospects are.
Last, this scenario was not entirely hypothetical – Driveline Baseball rolled out an early velocity program with a major league organization many years ago that had shockingly similar results to the hypothetical scenario, with gains in two players reaching about 3 MPH, one player suffering a major injury (though it did not require surgery, it was career ending), and the rest seeing minor or no real gains. Those two players went on to be minor league All-Stars, and both were separately traded for major league players that produced value for the organization.
There’s no way to rate that program as anything but a success in the acute phase – compounding even more when you find out that such program kickstarted a movement in the organization to accept weighted baseball training across player development and built systemic gains for the years ahead, including one notable non-prospect who would later go on to be a Cy Young contender.
Grade: Yes – and it’s not close. I agree with the Twitter poll.
There was a whole section of bonus questions and replies, and while I intended to get to those in this blog post, it’s already running long, so those will have to wait for another post and/or engagement on Twitter over on my @drivelinebases account.

What is the Isometric Seal Row? - Driveline Baseball,2022-02-22T01:00:58+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2022/02/what-is-the-isometric-seal-row/,"The Isometric Seal Row (ISR) is a multi-joint isometric test athletes perform lying prone on an elevated bench with a barbell locked into place below them, as pictured below. We use this test in our assessment as a measure of upper-body absolute strength. It is unique in our assessment because the test uses ForceHooks to measure output rather than the dual force plate setup in our lower-body assessments. (To read about the rest of our assessment series, check out our assessment overview blog, and to learn more about how we tested ForceHooks read our validation blog.)
Multi-joint isometric tests (MJITs) show numerous benefits over other maximal force testing methods, for our specific needs and athlete population. Among these benefits, the main strengths are lower injury risk and less technical lifting skill required to execute the test.
When we were deciding what to include in our strength assessment, we compared the ISR to other maximal isometric testing options, such as an isometric bench press. We wanted a test that fit several criteria. First, the test needed to be easily standardizable with reliable data so that results can be compared across all athletes that assess.
Next, the test needed to fit within our athletes’ normal assessment week, which typically includes our full strength assessment as well as at least one high intent throwing session. Among other criteria, we wanted a test that utilized a high output pull or press so that we would be able to get as close as possible to each athlete’s maximal upper-body force production in one test.
The final criteria narrowed our search to a horizontal row or press, and while both a prone/seal row and a bench/floor press fit the first criteria, the press failed the second criteria (test subjects reported significantly more soreness from the pressing movements than from the row).
1. Athlete lays on seal row bench face down, with the barbell directly below the bottom of their chest.
2. To determine the bar height, the athlete makes a 90° angle at the elbow while gripping the barbell with hands directly below the elbows.
3. Trainer plays an audible buzzer countdown with three short beeps and one three-second beep signifying the start and duration of the pull. This lets the athlete know what to expect during the trials. This is the same protocol as our IMTP.
4. The athlete is instructed to:
a. “Grip the barbell, but do not create any tension until the timer reaches go.”
b. “On the count of the buzzer, pull yourself to the bar as quickly and with as much force as possible, as if you are trying to pull yourself through the bench.”
5. Have the athlete perform two warmup/familiarization trials, first at 60% RPE and then 75% RPE.
6. The athlete performs three trials at maximum effort with one-minute rest between (any trials showing an unsteady baseline, countermovement at the onset of the rep, or peak force achieved at the very end of the effort indicating a yanking motion are discarded).
7. If the third trial is more than 100N higher than the first or second trial, the athlete performs a fourth trial.
While familiarization benefits are minimal in an MJIT, we still want multiple reps before any max effort trials so that the athlete can get comfortable with the test as well as familiar with the protocols and buzzer. The reps at 60 and 75% appear to be effective for familiarization and preparation, as most athletes see their best performance in the first two maximal trials.
In any standardized test, controlling as many variables outside of the variable that’s being tested is essential to ensure trustworthy data. This is why we measure joint angles to determine bar height for each athlete, as we don’t want athletes of different limb lengths to have any advantages or disadvantages. We chose 90° after testing multiple elbow angles because athletes reported little to no soreness at that angle, likely due to the lower output than higher joint angles, and it was also quickly standardizable.
There is some degree of error in the measurement due to the difference between an athlete’s positioning between slack (measuring), partially tense (warm-up/familiarization reps), and fully tense (maximal reps). If an athlete’s angle appears significantly changed during the warm-up reps we can re-measure, but once they are at 100% bar height should remain constant.
While familiarization benefits are minimal in an MJIT, we still want multiple reps before any max effort trials so that the athlete can get comfortable with the test as well as familiar with the protocols and buzzer. The reps at 60 and 75% appear to be effective for familiarization and preparation, as most athletes see their best performance in the first two maximal trials.
In the ISR we primarily look at two metrics: Peak Force (PF) and Relative Peak Force (RPF). If you recall from the IMTP, we typically use Net Peak Force as our measure of absolute strength, but in this case, there is no bodyweight on the dynamometer so Net Peak Force=Peak Force. Peak Force from the ISR gives us a metric for absolute upper-body strength, essentially a picture of how much force the athlete can possibly exert using their (posterior) upper body.
Dividing the PF by the athlete’s bodyweight provides RPF, and gives additional insight by telling us whether an athlete is strong for their size. As with RPF in the IMTP, this number is especially important for athletes who have an emphasis on their body weight in their current training phase. For example, an athlete looking to add muscle mass would want to see their RPF maintain or even increase as they gain weight, indicating that the newfound mass is actually helping them exert more force. On the opposite side, an athlete looking to lose weight would want to see at least a proportional increase in their RPF, indicating that the lost weight didn’t cost them strength.
Given that the bar is fixed on both ends to a ForceHook, we are collecting data from both hooks to eventually analyze athlete upper body asymmetries. At this point, a greater sample size and a thorough analysis are both necessary to determine what constitutes a significant or actionable asymmetry.
The ISR using ForceHooks gives us an upper-body maximal strength test that can be easily implemented with athletes of all training ages. The test shows a moderate positive correlation to athlete skill results (pitch speed and bat speed), and will soon be incorporated into a new version of our predicted velocity metric.

What if We Could Make Throwing Rehab Better? Doing my dissertation at Driveline Baseball - Driveline Baseball,2021-12-02T02:59:04+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/12/what-if-we-could-make-throwing-rehab-better-doing-my-dissertation-at-driveline-baseball/,"By Kyle Wasserberger, PhD, CSCS
This was the question at the heart of my dissertation. The premise: Pitchers are always going to get injured. Despite our best efforts, and no matter how good we get at reducing them, injuries are still going to happen (picture the little Dutch boy plugging the hole in the dike).
If we accept that injuries will never not be a thing, it begs the question: What if we could minimize the impact of those injuries that do still happen? What if we could get athletes back from injury faster, or better prepared to handle the demands of competition, or both?
When it comes to research, we (and by we I mean the sports medicine and sports science research communities) already devote considerable time, effort, and resources studying how to fend off injuries before they happen. Conversely, research aimed at minimizing the time and labor costs of the rehabilitation process is less common. Why not try and attack the injury problem from both directions? Yes, we should try to prevent as many injuries as we can. But, we should try just as hard (if not harder) to make the recovery process as smooth and efficient as possible for those injuries that do still happen.
Throwing rehabilitation programs prepare injured players to handle the demands placed on them during competition in as little time as possible. We can break down this process into three steps:
1. Start with small, tolerable throwing workloads
2. Gradually and systematically increase throwing workloads
3. Repeat until the athlete can tolerate workloads similar to those found in competition
These steps are reflected in the typical interval throwing program: Athletes start with relatively few throws at a relatively short distance. Over the course of several weeks, athletes perform more and more throws from longer and longer distances. Eventually, athletes return to the pitching mound and gradually increase their pitching workload. After passing enough checkpoints, they’re allowed to return to competition.
Current interval throwing programs rely primarily on throw number and throw distance, integrated with subjective feedback from the athlete about how their arm feels. More recently we have seen calls for radar gun inclusion to provide quantitative throwing intensity feedback. But what if there was a way to quantify throwing workload and intensity not only by how many throws you made and how far/fast you threw them, but by estimating the stress experienced by the throwing arm? What if we could integrate biomechanical analysis into the interval throwing program?
With my dissertation I wanted to gather information that could eventually be used to improve throwing rehabilitation protocols. In short, I wanted to know whether players responded differently to similar changes in throwing intensity (as measured by velo). If players respond differently, then it’s possible that more program individualization could be beneficial. What if a set increase in throwing intensity was a challenge for Player A but not a big deal for Player B? If both players were keeping the same rehab timeline, then either Player A would be progressing too fast, risking a setback, or Player B would be progressing too slow, costing valuable playing time.
To examine whether different players responded differently to increases in throwing intensities, I needed to quantify the loads placed on the throwing arm throughout the throwing intensity “spectrum” (i.e. starting at “first throws of the day” intensity, progressing all the way to maximum effort throwing). I brought players into the motion capture lab and recorded their mechanics as they performed a typical throwing warm up. Players were verbally instructed to progress from minimum to maximum intensity at their own pace. I then built a biomechanical model for each athlete and estimated the loads on the shoulder and elbow for every throw. The result was a joint load vs. velo curve unique to each athlete. Two such curves are emphasized in the figure below…
In total, I collected data on 1,318 throws from 36 players, 32 of which I could use for my dissertation. Once I had the biomechanical data, I had to model each athlete’s curve statistically. To do this, I turned to mixed-effects modeling, a technique used commonly in fields like quantitative psychology but rarely used in biomechanics.
For those unaware, mixed-effects modeling (aka multilevel modeling, hierarchical modeling, and plenty of other names) is a statistical analysis technique which takes nested data (i.e. throws nested within athletes, students nested within classrooms, voters nested within political districts, etc.) and builds a regression model for each “group” in context of the data as a whole (in my case, each group was an athlete). The athlete-level model quantifies the within-athlete relationship between throwing intensity and throwing arm joint loading, while the whole-data model quantifies the average athlete-level model across my entire sample. This approach makes mixed-effects models well suited for examining within- and between-athlete relationships at the same time. My question was not just “what’s the relationship between joint loading and velo?” but (simultaneously) “what’s the relationship between joint loading and velo and is that relationship different between athletes?”, which includes one within-athlete question and one between-athlete question.
Anyways, at first glance, the first half of my question (“What’s the relationship between joint loading and velo?”) is pretty straightforward. We already know that as velo goes up, so does joint loading. But I was more interested in whether the increase in joint loading for a given increase in velo was consistent across the entire throwing intensity spectrum. In statistical language: Was the within-athlete relationship between velo and joint loading linear or nonlinear?
Although previous research out of ASMI has shown a strong linear relationship between velo and elbow valgus torque per unit bodyweight height, this relationship was only shown for game-effort throwing from a mound. What about submaximal intensity throws? What about flatground throws? Since most of the throwing rehab program is not performed at game-effort and not performed from a pitching mound, there was definitely a gap in the research that I felt should be addressed. Including the entire throwing intensity spectrum would increase the applicability of my findings to rehab settings.
Once I established the within-athlete relationship between velo and joint loading across the entire throwing intensity spectrum, I wanted to see if that relationship differed between athletes. This is where mixed-effects modeling can shine. By allowing each athlete to have their own regression line, I could estimate the regression equation parameters for everyone in my sample (recall that I’m modeling each athlete as a combination of the “average” model across the entire athlete sample (sometimes called fixed effects) plus some deviation from that average (sometimes called random effects). If athletes didn’t differ much in their responses to increases in throwing intensity, then the random effects would be small and the fixed effects by themselves would suffice. If athletes did show differences in their joint loading vs. velo relationship, then including random effects would fit the data better.
Let’s revisit the figure from earlier showing shoulder rotation torque on the x-axis and velo on the y-axis, but this time with the fixed-effects-only model added.
Overall, there are some pretty distinct nonlinear trends in the data (at least at the group level), indicating that the relationship between velo and throwing arm joint loading may not be linear throughout the entire throwing intensity spectrum. Additionally, you can see Player A is consistently above and to the left of the average model, indicating that they threw faster than average for a given level of shoulder rotation torque, while Player B is slightly below and to the right of the average model, indicating that they threw slower than average for a given level of shoulder rotation torque.
In addition to overall position on the plot, we can look at the slope of the individual athlete regression lines. Player A shows a steeper slope with less plateauing than Player B. A steeper slope represents a greater increase in velo for a set increase in shoulder rotation torque. In this fictional scenario, if Player A and Player B were both going through a radar-gun guided rehabilitation program and prescribed the same intensity increase for the next phase of their program, Player A may not be challenged enough or Player B may be challenged too much. Either would be sub-optimal and could cost the player and their team playing time and money.
What’s the deal here? Why do Player A and Player B have different regression lines? What does having different regression lines even mean, and does it have ramifications for throwing rehab protocols? Is this stuff even worth the extra effort or is the standard interval throwing program good enough?
We’re only just getting started down this line of research and, while some of these questions are more easily answered than others, the takeaway here is that mixed-effects modeling gives us a framework for answering them where more common analysis techniques may fall short. Simultaneous modeling of within- and between-athlete phenomena through mixed-effects models can help address the limitations of applying group-based inferences to the individual, as well as the limitations of extrapolating single-subject results across diverse training populations.
Stay tuned. In the next part of this blog, we’ll dive into  how we can build up our model to try to explain the between-athlete differences and how Driveline Pulse may be able to help.

The Makeup of a Pitcher Debuting in the Major Leagues - Driveline Baseball,2021-09-26T22:40:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/the-makeup-of-a-pitcher-debuting-in-the-major-leagues/,"By Connor Hinchliffe, Pitching Trainer
From 2015 to 2020, nearly 1,000 pitchers have made their Major League debuts.This blog will spotlight the pitchers who have made it to The Show, specifically summarizing makeup (age, height, weight, nationality) and their route to pro ball (college, high school, international) in order to give more recent context to what type of players are debuting, where they are from, and how they got there.
Player age is an important variable in the process of projecting and assessing the true value of a prospect. The importance of age in player development is due to an existing aging curve, which explains that you can expect a player’s performance to decline over time as they age due to a variety of factors.
The Hardball Times aging curve analysis from 2005-2019 shows that once a pitcher reaches their mid-to-late 20’s they will see a significant decline in performance over time, mostly as a result of declining fastball velocity (pretending Jacob DeGrom doesn’t exist). Our updated research from 2010-2021 supports similar theories when investigating velocity and both strikeout and walk percentages.
On average, pitchers saw a bump in velocity on their heater from around age 22 to 26 years of age. At ~27 years old, fastball velocity is expected to decline. It is important to note survivorship bias, which explains that we can only account for the older players that stayed in the big leagues, and can’t account for players who were released or retired in the sample.
Looking at how age affects command, we see that players tend to have their best walk rates between ages 22 and 30. After age 30, walk rates start to climb.
Lastly, due to both declining velocity and command, players 30 and older punch out hitters at a below league average level. Ages 20 to 25 show increasing, above average strikeout percentages. However, punchouts start to decline after age 25, until they reach below average at age 30.
In baseball, age is yet another statistic that gives context to the performance and valuation of a prospect or MLB player.
If a player is succeeding at a level where he is younger than the competition, you can be bullish on the value of his performance. On the other hand, it is less impressive for a prospect to be succeeding when he is significantly older than the competition. In this case, his statistics need to be taken with a grain of salt, or you could give him a promotion to see how he performs against his true peers and age level. There are extenuating circumstances though, such as a player being new to pitching even at a later age.
In the density plot below, we can see the age distribution for all pitchers who made their debut from 2015-2020. The average age of all players is 24.8 years old, the youngest were 19-20 years old, while the oldest to debut were 33-34 years old. All five of the oldest players to debut had playing experience in the Nippon Professional Baseball league in Japan.
Understanding the context behind age and its natural effects on performance can help players (development) and coaches/coordinators (evaluating, development, scouting) for a few reasons:
Getting to the big leagues is hard, while getting there and sticking is even harder. Pitchers are likely getting better at fending off aging effects with advanced training methods, but continuous declining performance still exists and can derail careers if not accounted for.
Driveline has the tools to not only help you maximize your potential, but also help you sustain that potential for as long as possible.
The “eye test” exists for a reason, and that’s because athletes at the highest level of their sport are usually physically imposing figures. The average pitcher in this sample was 6 feet 2.5 inches tall and weighed 213 pounds, while 70% of the pitchers weighed over 200 pounds. If you are an athlete struggling to put big numbers on the radar gun and weigh 170 pounds, increasing strength and body weight is a good place to start.
Looking the part matters.
For players trying to reach the big leagues, there are so many factors out of your control. However, it is widely understood that body weight, strength, and power are controllable factors that play a significant role in a pitcher’s ability to throw hard.
For a long time, it was frowned upon for a pitcher to lift heavy in the gym because it was thought to affect mobility and increase injuries, or a variety of other debunked things. Now, pitchers are spending more time in the weightroom in both the off-season and in-season, lifting heavier, and as a result, getting heavier. Between 1990 and 2010, the average weight of an MLB player increased by 20.9 pounds from 188lbs to 209lbs.
Major League Baseball is a diverse sport of players from many countries, and their impact on the culture of the game can be seen now more than ever. On active opening day rosters this season, there were 256 international players, representing 20 different countries. The US (72%), Dominican Republic (10%), and Venezuela (7%) were the top three countries supplying big league talent on opening day in 2021.
These trends were almost identical for pitchers debuting from 2015-2020. The United States represented 76% of players, Dominican Republic showed 11%, and Venezuela was in third with 7%. The rest of the world combined to make up the final 6%.
Digging deeper, we can break down the American players, both college and high school signees, by state. Unsurprisingly, California, Texas, and Florida were the top three states producing the most players, as they’re bigger in size and are commonly regarded as ametaur baseball hotbeds. Wyoming, Vermont, and Maine were without a single player during this five year span.The southeast and northeast regions had the highest populations of players when accounting for player-per-square mile.
*From publicly available data*
By which route did these players get to professional baseball? We broke down whether they entered professional baseball by way of the draft/free agent signs (college or high school), or international signings.
The majority broke into pro-ball via college, making up over half of the players at 59%. Louisville, Florida, Cal-State Fullerton, Kentucky, and Vanderbilt had the most debuts during this five year span. International signs accounted for nearly a quarter of the pitchers at 24%. Lastly, 17% of the players came straight from high school, with California, Florida, and Texas supplying the most of those prospects.
There are plenty of paths for amateur players to reach professional baseball and chase their dreams of making it to the big leagues. This piece aimed to give a more recent update on the people toeing the rubber in the show for the first time—who they are, and how they got there.

Rethinking the True Run Value of a Pitch With a Pitch Model - Driveline Baseball,2021-09-23T22:27:14+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/rethinking-the-true-run-value-of-a-pitch-with-a-pitch-model/,"By John Asel, Baseball Ops Intern
Our intrinsic pitch values combine stuff and pitch location to predict the expected change in run value a given pitch should create based on its raw flight characteristics. It is pretty darn good, but it is not perfect. Certain pitchers—through deception, sequencing, tunneling, etc—have demonstrated the ability to consistently exceed our expectations from year to year.
We know players like this will exist, but how much data do we need until we can confidently say that someone is an outlier relative to their peers?
That question is the basis of this investigation.
The metric we will be using across these analyses is the change in run value (RE12 with an xwOBA base) minus the intrinsic pitch value (from our pitch model); in other words, the difference between the observed and expected run value changes on a pitch-by-pitch basis.
We’ll refer to this metric as “intrinsic residual” where negative is the pitcher performing better than expected.
To test the reliability of “intrinsic residual”, we will be using Cronbach’s alpha. For those unfamiliar with Cronbach’s alpha, FanGraphs wrote a great introduction in 2015 which we highly encourage you to read if you have not already.
The gist is that Cronbach’s alpha measures the internal consistency of a sample, giving us an estimate of what proportion of the variance observed is reproducible (likely due to ‘true talent’) as opposed to randomness. The typical alpha threshold considered reliable is 0.7—where ~50% of the variance is attributable to a rough proxy for ‘true talent’.
With the gory math aside and our framework built out, we can first look at a player’s general intrinsic residual to give us a sense of the X factor they possess relative to our model.
A negative value indicates that a pitcher performed better than expected while a positive value indicates that a pitcher performed worse than expected. Taking the sum of these residuals on the pitch-by-pitch level can give us an idea which pitchers have cumulatively deviated from our model’s expectations the most during the Statcast era (2015-present).
Keep in mind that the units of these residuals are runs. So, Kyle Hendricks has prevented 219 more runs over the Statcast era than our model predicted—even though the model does account for his otherworldly command.
To put that in perspective, according to baseballreference.com, Hendricks has prevented 126 runs relative to a league average pitcher. Without his X factor, our model thinks he would have been as below average as he has been above average.
Had Hendricks not possessed such an ability to exceed expectations, he would not be the pitcher he is today and he would not get the playing time he gets today. In other words, players with poor X factors are fighting an uphill battle because they must be several runs better to survive.
This is the essence of survivorship bias and it explains why the pitchers who are beating our model by the most are doing so at a higher magnitude than those who are relatively underperforming. For example, if a hypothetical pitcher had a X factor that hurt them as much as Scherzer’s X factor helps him, they would have to possess elite stuff just to be league average.
Then again, the analysis above is just taking the sum of residuals, which is highly dependent on playing time accrued. To avoid playing-time bias, we need to build a rate statistic and use some sample size threshold to find the true leaders and laggards.
That brings us back to the question we set out to answer: At what point can we be confident that the intrinsic residual we are observing is not just randomness?
To answer this question, we need to look at the graphic above showing Cronbach’s alpha values at various sample sizes on the season (blue) and career (red) levels. It is a lot to look at if you have not seen one of these graphs before, so let’s do an example interpretation.
When X = 1000, the required sample size to be included is 1000 pitches thrown. Looking at the graph’s dotted lines, we see that ~50% of pitchers and ~30% of pitcher-seasons in the Statcast era have thrown 1000+ pitches. When those with less than 1000 pitches are filtered out of our sample, the alpha value is ~0.5 for both the season and career levels. Thus, we can infer that when looking at a player’s entire career or at a specific season, it takes approximately 1000 pitches for 25% of their average intrinsic residual to be explained by ‘true talent’ as opposed to randomness.
Example aside, we’re more concerned with the 0.7 threshold—the level where 50% of the variance is explained by ‘true talent’—and where it is crossed, as that is where most traditional baseball analysts consider a metric ‘reliable’. As shown above, this threshold is crossed just above 3000 pitches on both the season and career levels.
Below are the mean intrinsic residual leaders and laggards with a minimum of 3000 career pitches thrown in the Statcast era.
As in the previous table, we see that the pitcher-friendly residuals are of a larger absolute magnitude than the hitter-friendly residuals. Brad Ziegler, with his unorthodox release point, outperforms expectations by one run every 33 pitches!
Looking at general X factors like this is cool, but how does it break down on the pitch type level? Do all pitchers’ pitches exceed expectations uniformly or do certain pitch types deliver the bulk of the benefits? Let’s run the same procedure but treat each pitcher’s pitch types distinctly.
Grouping by pitch type cuts down on our sample size but is quite insightful. While players generally take 3040 pitches to reach career mean intrinsic residual reliability across all pitches, the average player-pitch type only takes 1400 pitches to do so. This suggests that, for any given pitcher, certain pitch types will systematically deviate from our model’s predictions to different degrees and—in some instances—in opposite directions.
An astute reader may be wondering, why do the season and career trends diverge around 400 pitches? Sample size is our friend here. What pitch types persist as the minimum sample size threshold is raised? Fastballs. If fastballs take longer to reliably defy our models, it makes sense for the slope of the Cronbach alpha chart to decrease as fastballs become a disproportionate part of the remaining pitch population.
To test this hypothesis, I looked at how long it takes each of the major pitch types to reach the alpha threshold of .7 at the career level.
Figure Three: Red = Four-seamers, Orange = Sinkers, Green = Changeups, Blue = Curveballs, Purple = Sliders, Brown = Cutters, Black = All Pitch Types. The dotted lines pertain to the remaining proportion of that pitch type’s population that survives the corresponding sample size threshold.
As hypothesized, fastballs take longer to become reliable and come to dominate the population of remaining pitch types as the sample size threshold is raised. That explains the season-career gap in Figure Two, but let’s see what this graph has to say about the speed at which various pitch types become reliable.
The intrinsic residuals of breaking balls reach the threshold far quicker than the other pitch types. This suggests a contextual nature to breaking balls. Whether due to arsenal interplay or a particular dependence on deception, the outcomes of sliders and curveballs relatively quickly diverge from what their raw flight characteristics would suggest.
With these pitch-type-specific thresholds, we can see which pitches have reliably defied our model at both extremes.
In looking at the table above, we observe a lot of sinkers at the top, no? Indeed and there is quite a good reason for it: Seam-shifted wake (SSW).
We have written about this before, so to avoid rehashing too heavily, here’s the gist: When the seams on a pitch are oriented in a certain way, the ball will gain a particularly deceptive type of movement. This effect is most commonly observed in sinkers and those atop this list are known creators of this funky movement.
Our model, developed before SSW was discovered, looks at just the flight characteristics of a given pitch and cannot tell whether movement was produced normally or via SSW. With SSW being a key to a sinker’s success, it makes sense that many of the largest residuals come from those who generate the effect.
On the other end of the spectrum, we see all sliders and curveballs. It is interesting to note how elite these pitches are—maybe it is a clue to why breaking balls reach intrinsic residual reliability so quickly. Perhaps hitters know the quality of the pitch and must sit on it to some extent so they don’t end up on PitchingNinja.
That might be part of the reason Sonny Gray has two pitches on opposite ends of the spectrum; hitters are terrified of being embarrassed by his curveball and give up some extra ground to his sinker.
After a certain number of pitches, we can be confident that a given pitcher’s pitch will continue defying our model’s expectations. But to what extent? At any given sample size, how much credit do we give the player? Thankfully, those Cronbach alpha values can help us out again. As detailed in a different FanGraphs article, the higher the alpha value, the less you regress to the mean.
So, in truth, there is no single point where you can suddenly start trusting the residuals. Instead, new data should be used in concert with what was already known to constantly refine our expectations going forward.
In the table above, we see some of the dirtiest breaking balls in the game at the top, with some position players at the bottom. Looking good.
That said, it is worth taking a moment to discuss how certain pitcher-pitch types end up at the top of this list. There are essentially three avenues that exist on a spectrum:
The first avenue is well exemplified by the sliders of both Dellin Betances and Max Scherzer. Our model recognizes them as nasty pitches, but based on extraordinary results in sufficient sample sizes, our refined expectations rightfully elevate them to some of the best pitches in baseball.
Although Sam Clay’s slider falls just outside the top five pitches, it is a golden example of the third avenue: Underperforming yet ultimately rate highly. The key to such a feat? Pitch count.
At the time of writing, Sam Clay has thrown 149 sliders in the major leagues. That pitch count corresponds with a high intrinsic pitch value reliability (alpha = 0.88), but a low intrinsic residual reliability (alpha = 0.20). In simpler terms, we have a strong belief that Clay’s SL is nasty, even by lofty big-league standards, and we cannot be sure that it will continue to underperform our expectations moving forward due to a small sample size.
Pitches can still rate highly if the results on the field provide insufficient evidence to overrule the model’s original output.
When evaluating an athlete, we need to understand which pitches are assets and which are ripe for improvement. Stuff+ from The Blob tells most of the story, but command and results need to be considered as well.
Imagine a pitcher with a changeup that grades below average in raw stuff, but who also has impeccable command with the pitch. If they could adopt a better shape with the same feel, that would be great, but there is likely lower hanging fruit in the arsenal. Further, if the changeup has consistently produced better results than expected, we can be confident that it is not in need of fixing.
Getting better starts when building a plan of attack; finding weaknesses and ways to improve them. With this infrastructure to weigh in-game success against raw flight characteristics, we can decode mixed signals and better aid the outliers on their path to greener pastures.

Bat Fitting: How to Choose a Bat,2021-09-22T01:00:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/09/how-were-using-science-to-make-sure-the-bat-you-swing-is-helping-your-performance/,"Written by Andrew Cresci – Hitting Intern
Working at every level of baseball, one of the most common questions I have been asked by both parents and athletes alike is “what bat is best for me / my son / my daughter?”
This is a question that will elicit many different responses, but the majority tend to err on the side of “feel” as the determining factor. Now, “feel” is certainly important, but these days selecting the right bat is about more than just feel; there is a science to help determine whether our equipment is improving our swing or amplifying its flaws.
Additionally, there’s also a possibility that the 34 inch/31 ounce bat you’ve been swinging all season is not actually what the label says it is. Not all bats with identical reported lengths and weights are found to be equal in actual dimensions… So, that bulk order of fresh lumber you bought prior to the season may, in fact, not always be true to your intended implement of choice.
That is a huge amount of uncertainty to navigate with just “feel” alone.
Our bat fitting process begins with finding the true measurements of a bat, including both length and weight. Calculating length is as simple as it sounds, but just 41 percent of bats logged in our database measured in as advertised. The numbers get significantly worse when dealing with weight, as not a single bat in our entire system measured true to the number etched on the barrel.
That’s not ideal.
Aside from finding these “true” measurement values, we also calculate how the weight of your bat is distributed and, ultimately, how this will affect the performance of your swing.
Utilizing specialty bat fitting equipment, we are able to measure what is called the MOI (or Moment of Inertia) of each bat in our facility.
This is a measurement of how difficult it is to change the rotational velocity of an object that is rotating around a “pivot point”. (Russell. Moment-of-Inertia of a Baseball or Softball Bat.)
This means that when weight is distributed towards the end of a bat, the MOI increases. If weight is distributed down towards the handle, the MOI decreases. A lower MOI bat requires less force to rotate around a pivot point.
A great example to illustrate this concept is our overload speed trainers—handle-load vs. barrel-load.
So, if bat speed is king and you can swing a lower MOI bat faster with less force, then the choice is easy, right?
Not quite.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
Lower MOI bats will see an increase in bat speed as well as adjustability because the weight distribution is placed towards the handle and, ultimately, the hitter’s body; however, these benefits will come with diminishing returns, as the lower the MOI, the less mass you’ll have present in the barrel.
Conversely, higher MOI bats will offer this greater barrel mass, which will transfer force from bat to ball at a greater rate (i.e. higher exit velocities), but can lower bat speed while also limiting adjustability.
An easy way to understand how these two values interact is by looking at Newton’s 2nd law:
Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma).
So, if an athlete’s potential bat speed remains constant while swinging a lower MOI bat, the exit velocity of their potential batted balls would decrease, holding all else equal.
For a more in-depth dive into bat physics, Driveline hitting trainer Richard Prigatano has written a great blog that can be found here.
Now that we have an understanding of the true measurements of our bats, as well as the pros and cons of weight distribution, the actual bat fitting process can begin.
As always, we are looking to replicate game-like intent and environment in order to gain accurate insight into a hitter’s metrics. In other words, you won’t just take a few swings off a tee and then receive a recommendation.
Athletes will swing an assortment of selected bats with a pre-determined variance in both size and MOI. Utilizing a bat sensor, combined with batted ball data, metrics will be collected and evaluated by Driveline hitting staff in order to match a hitter to an implement that best fits their swing profile.
Train at Driveline
As discussed previously, it’s not just about bat speed when selecting a bat, as simply increasing the length of an implement can give your numbers in that category a little boost. An athlete’s entire swing profile needs to be taken into account.
Utilizing all this data, as well as Driveline’s extensive research, our recommendation will include several bat models that will fit the size and MOI variations that provide the best fit for the athlete.
With Driveline’s massive resources in both research and athlete data, the bat fitting process will continue to improve and develop as we seek to better understand how we can measure and push the limits of baseball performance. For now, bat fitting snapshots will provide athletes with the certainty that their equipment specifications are in line with what the knob says they are, as well as being the best match for their swing so that they can maximize performance at the plate.
Baseball has followed many of the trends present in golf, so it is easy to envision a time when a hitter may possess several different bats with ranges in MOI that would be interchanged according to the situation or the opponent’s pitching arsenal.
While some major leaguers currently deploy different bats with slight variances in size, refining this to further specialize fit for skill set and MOI range performance is one of the many potential benefits that lies in the future of bat fitting.
With the technology available to us, we can finally take the guesswork out of equipment selection and instill hitters with the confidence that comes from knowing they are bringing the right gear to the plate. After all the work you have put in to improve your game, it only makes sense that your bat puts you in the best position to succeed and showcase your ability.

Quantitative vs. Qualitative Mechanical Analysis in Pitching Biomechanics -,2021-08-28T00:51:06+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/quantitative-vs-qualitative-mechanical-analysis-in-pitching-biomechanics/,"Written by Chris Langin
“Johnny! If you used those legs, you’d throw a good 5-7 miles per hour harder!”
If you’re reading this blog, you’re likely familiar with the mechanical jargon used throughout the world of baseball.
From youth fields across the globe to the 9-figure stadiums that play host to the world’s most talented hurlers, there’s undoubtedly a coach, parent, or spectator discussing their displeasure with a pitcher’s mechanics at this very second.
At some point during your baseball career, you’ve likely found yourself in Johnny’s shoes. You’ve also recently noticed that the umpire has yet to throw somebody out of a game for throwing the baseball too fast.
This realization seems pretty insightful, but given certainty isn’t your strength, you discuss the topic with your family during dinner. Your intuition turns out to be correct; the pitcher is, in fact, not restricted to any sort of speed limit.
A few months go by and you’re not quite certain how fast you’re throwing the baseball, but you know you want to throw it faster.
Then, one day during your bullpen session, you receive some critical feedback regarding your pitching technique: “If you used those legs, you’d throw a good 5-7 miles per hour harder!”
At first, you’re frustrated that you’ve done something incorrect. Usually, this type of thing only happens when you forget to do your homework. However, you grin inside when it sinks in that using your legs better could improve your velocity.
This is some of the best news you’ve heard. Heck, you couldn’t even stand on two feet and walk at one point in your life. Getting into those legs a bit more during your pitching motion seems elementary.
Three days later, your next bullpen opportunity arrives. “Just use your legs,” you tell yourself. Your confidence is extremely high while you’re playing catch. You lift your lead leg up and down for several reps, acknowledging that you indeed will use this leg today.
You alert your catcher that the ball is going to be coming in firmer today. He smells like chlorine and doesn’t seem to care much. After mimicking a few more leg lifts for good measure, you finally toe the rubber. You close your eyes and take a deep breath. Finally, you convince yourself you’re ready for this life-changing moment.
You wind-up and leverage your legs for the first time during an overhead toss in your life. The ball arrives at the plate and the dirt in front of the mound remains undamaged. Your catcher lifelessly tosses the ball back to you.
“How was that?” you ask.
“Little slower than last week,” he responds.
After three more tosses that end in a similar result, you scream this question at the top of your lungs:
“How the hell do I use my legs?”
Helping Johnny out is the motivation of our quantitative/qualitative study.
All performance coaches have good intentions:
Leverage the resources at your disposal to identify your athletes’ limiting factors.
Relay that information in a digestible manner, with the goal of improving that athlete’s performance.
With our motion capture lab, we’re able to precisely quantify how our athletes are moving to identify their movement limitations and track changes. However, most athletes and trainers don’t have access to a lab, so have to make due with what they do have. While the lab is the optimal solution for assessing mechanics, we’d be remiss if we claimed players and coaches are helpless without it.
While a trainer’s misplaced overconfidence in their understanding of how an athlete’s mechanics work could get in the way of the athlete, the other extreme of providing no feedback limits how much you can help an athlete.
Many of our pitching trainers at Driveline came from low-level college ranks. If a fresh set of baseballs wasn’t in the cards, there certainly wouldn’t be any motion capture labs in the budget.
While you can track if your athletes improve, there are a variety of competing variables that could be responsible such as strength, bodyweight, sleep, and simple throwing fitness improvements. Thus, it can be tough to know what is a result of your mechanical feedback (qualitative in the absence of a lab) or not, to use that as a proxy for how good you are at assessing mechanics.
This hindsight inspired us to partake in a qualitative/quantitative pitching kinematics study. Trainers could uncover their “true talent” level in evaluating kinematic positions in slow-motion. This also allows us to start peeling away at Johnny’s question: “How do I use my legs?”.
Johnny’s original question was a bit too broad, though he’s on the right track to question what exactly that meant. We intended to quantify some of the following mechanical jargon commonly passed around in the gym:
We wanted to identify whether there was validity to these qualitative categories. If so, what biomechanics actually define these classifications? The open/closed pelvis question is more easily defined. This question identified our trainers “true talent” in analyzing biomechanics qualitatively.
For reference, pitching assessments at Driveline last five days. On day one, athletes throw in the motion capture lab. Athletes have their biomechanics meeting on day three. The R&D department processes that report over that time period, giving us about a 48-hour window to provide a qualitative assessment, without it potentially being biased by having seen the actual report.
For an athlete to qualify for our study, trainers/athletes must meet the following criteria:
All in-gym trainers at Driveline took part in the study. To account for trainer bandwidth concerns, we assigned three trainers to each athlete. We took the weight of those three trainer samples over the weight of each individual trainer to get a better feel for department opinion. While we may incorporate this in a future analysis, there was a fear of significant noise given we didn’t have a 100+ athlete sample.
We used iPhone side-view video with a standardized set up. If parallax error was present, we omitted the athlete from the sample. We also saw some user errors occur when taking videos. We omitted athletes that had their videos return to regular speed prior to ball release.
This study started right at the start of collegiate summer. Our department analyzed the first athlete on May 3rd, and the last athlete on June 20th, creating a sample of 56 athletes. If two or more trainers chose the same positive response for a category, that athlete was binned accordingly.
Example: Two trainers responded with Athlete A being rotational, one responded “undecided”. That athlete would be a rotational thrower.
However, if the response was even across the board (one rotational, one linear, one undecided) we omitted the athlete from our analysis.
Let’s first begin by looking at our “qualitative categories”.
Rotational vs. Linear Thrower
Most compelling differences:
Whippy vs. Pushy Arm Action
Whippy pitchers…
Glute vs. Quad dominant
And finally, our lone qualitative kinematic question to judge our trainers “true talent” in assessing positions with slow-motion side view:
Open vs. Closed Pelvis at Foot Plant
Open pitchers had…
Slow motion video is a resource that should continue to be leveraged by coaches, trainers, and athletes. The pitching department could discern significant differentiators in pelvis angle at foot plant.
These findings could apply to daily throwing evaluation between a trainer and athlete. This study however doesn’t suggest trainers have the talent level to quantify kinematic positions at foot plant with even 90% certainty.
However, binning athletes in ~15 degree buckets (Open/Closed) could have some credence. Adding in multiple opinions from other trainers/coaches likely ups the certainty level in the accuracy of these buckets as well.
Any type of remote training especially gains value from these insights. While our in-gym population still benefits from feedback between retests, they’re still provided a retest report every 6 weeks that is void of subjective evaluation. Online trainers may have an athlete for 4+ months without a retest motion capture during that time period. The ability to bucket these athletes via collaboration between their co-workers and managers likely adds further accuracy to their evaluation.
In addition, our lab could detect (based on our trainers’ judgement) the validity of several qualitative categories.
The methods for this study were not very rigorous. Largely, this study’s intention was to detect signal for future work on the topic. With limited previous work, an extremely rigorous protocol didn’t seem efficient given the scarcity of trainer hours during the summer.
Selection bias is also unavoidable in this study. Evaluators in this study were all trainers from Driveline. Trainers evaluate several hundred motion capture reports a year. Identifying how accurately an average coach, or another portion of the population, could make kinematic evaluations would be a significant insight.
Further evaluation of qualitative categories is on the agenda. Quantifying these categories with kinematic variables provides us with more closure on what they’re detailing.
“Good/Bad Downward Move?”
“Vertical vs. Non-Vertical Shin Angle?”
“Heel Connection vs. Early Extension?”
The same exists with qualitative kinematic evaluations. It’s likely that certain kinematic variables (torso rotational velo,  are easier to evaluate without a motion capture session than others.
A study showcasing the error range to expect from the “coaching eye” provides coaches with some clarity during their evaluations. Certain metrics may warrant confident feedback when using side view as a resource. For others, perhaps voiding any opinion is best.
“Elbow Flexion Inside 90 degrees vs. Outside 90 degrees.”
“Shoulder Horizontal Abduction: Good/Average/Bad?”
Finally, we’d love to introduce a larger population into our evaluation pool. Detailing what the average coach’s evaluation looks like is the ultimate insight we’re looking for.
Most coaches/trainers aren’t going to have the luxury of constant access to a biomechanics lab. Furthermore, their livelihood isn’t dependent on delivering these mocap findings to athletes 365 days a year. The practical implications of these studies for a broader public depends on getting a study that includes evaluations from a variety of coaches.
And Johnny, to answer your question… just throw in a biomechanics lab.

How Different Drills and Ball Weights Affect an Athlete's Workload,2021-08-20T00:45:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/08/how-different-drills-and-ball-weights-affect-an-athletes-workload/,"By David Besky – Data Scientist
In any training program, in throwing as in lifting, the goal is to stress the body with an appropriate stimulus. The key is for this stimulus to be great enough to cause adaptation while also appropriate given the athlete’s needs and previous training such that they’ll be able to recover sufficiently to achieve that adaptation.
PULSE allows for precise tracking of throwing workload, and all you need to do is put the sensor on before throwing and sync the data post session (or mid-session if you want intermittent feedback to make on the fly adjustments).
Given that athletes will vary in terms of regulating volume and intensity, two athletes may differ moderately in terms of workload even when given the same instructions and program. With PULSE, you’re able to track that, provide individualized feedback, and adjust programming to optimize the athlete’s training.
That said, until you have a detailed picture of each athlete’s training habits, it can be helpful to have some ballpark numbers averaged across different athletes to create a rough framework for the workloads you want to prescribe, based on workout type, ball weight, and different drills.
Looking at data from our in-gym athletes, who have been using PULSE since September 2020, we can calculate those average values, as well as look at the variation between different athletes.
One of the main concerns when designing a program is determining how much an athlete should throw on a given day. This is dictated by their preparedness and desired/required throwing fitness goals or training state.
Generally, we recommend progressively increasing workload week over week when training during the offseason to avoid spiking the acute workload (workload for a given week) much over the level of throwing fitness the athlete has developed in prior weeks.
In our training programs, the desired throwing intensity and volume have historically been indicated by workout types as follows:
Below, we see the following average values of One Day Workload (a combined measure including number of throws for the day and intensity of those throws) for those different workout types:
Vertical lines indicate 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile values.
We see that the lower intensity throwing days (Recovery and Hybrid B days) generally have lower One Day Workloads, as might be expected.
Looking at those three main classes of velo days, we see that Plyo Ball ® velos have the lowest One Day Workloads in-gym on average, with a median One Day Workload of 14.0, compared to 17.8 for mound velos and 18.2 for pulldowns.
In addition to the cumulative One Day Workload, another consideration may be an athlete’s peak single throw torque on a given day. Generally, we’ll give more weight to One Day Workload as it incorporates the intensity of all throws and is not going to be as affected by an athlete cranking out a single throw at high intensity on submaximal days.
Still, especially in rehab settings, peak torque can be a useful check-point for ensuring that intensity is being increased as desired.
The other component of workload is total throws, so we can also break that down by day type:
The relatively higher workload days tend to be at least in part caused by athletes taking more throws on those days (rather than the increase being driven by intensity only).
And even though time doesn’t factor into cumulative workload, we can also compare how long athletes took to complete all their throws for different workouts using the time stamps on throws:
These times are just based on all the athlete’s throws on PULSE during the workout and thus do not include a general dynamic warm-up and non-throwing specific warm-up components (such as J-Bands, Wrist Weights, Shoulder Tube, etc.).
We see that our athletes usually spend 15-20 minutes throwing on recovery days, and between 25-50 minutes on other days, spending a bit longer on pulldown days than on other workout types, on average.
Within a workout, changing ball weight and using various constraint drills will have some effect on the workload of individual throws, so having a ballpark idea of the size of the effect may help you tailor programming as needed.
So, for example, if an athlete did 10 throws with the blue ball, that would on average be 1.57 workload units (10*0.157) towards their One Day Workload total. Alternatively, it’d take only about 5-6 (5.6 to be exact) gray ball throws to achieve that same cumulative workload (on average—individual athletes will differ, but these average values provide a starting point for comparing across different weights).
In addition to varying the number of throws an athlete will do with each ball weight, you may also vary drill volume for specific athletes based on what you want them to emphasize.
With a rough idea of how workload/torques vary between drills, we can make adjustments as necessary if switching the balance between the different drills.
While most of the actionable info comes from workload/torques, we can look at the other metrics as well to get an idea for any variation relevant to different drills:
We see that the more constrained drills like the pivot pickoff and the roll in, which are typically done with the heaviest balls, come in with the lowest average torques. They are typically used on recovery days more than the other drills, so that may bias the comparison slightly. Among the drills for which we’ll cycle through the four lighter balls (blue, red, yellow, gray), Janitors and Walking Windups have slightly higher torques than Step Backs and Drop Steps, across the different ball weights.
As with the torques, we see higher arm speeds for underload balls and less constrained drills.
We see a general trend where PULSE arm slots are a touch higher for heavier Plyo Ball ® (specifically the blue ball) within each of the less constrained drills that use all ball weights. The magnitude of difference in arm slots is only a couple degrees, but it’s interesting to see nonetheless (fully detailed in the table below).
Individual tracking enabled by PULSE allows for individualized athlete workload comparisons and adjustments, but some normative values can be helpful for providing a ballpark idea of how different drills and ball weights would affect an athlete’s workload from their program. Some guys tend to blow it out or may throw different Plyo Ball ® with varying intensities—which PULSE can provide feedback on for specific tailoring. Using either generic average or player specific info, you can build out a plan to reach specific goals, and then fine-tune this plan with adjustments based on the specific athlete’s daily feedback. A couple examples of these adjustments are:
PULSE will help you learn about and improve your athletes’ training habits. As you get started with PULSE and collect your own data, the reference ranges shown above can get you going in the right direction.

Caught Looking: July 2021 - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-16T00:45:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/caught-looking-july-2021/,"The importance of cognition, visuospatial processing, and intelligence is something we have been interested in  and is a relatively unknown frontier of baseball. How much do the non-physical aspects of training matter and can we work on developing them to improve athlete performance?
Bowman et al. recently published a study looking at The Athletic Intelligence Quotient (AIQ) and its relation to performance outcomes in professional baseball players.The AIQ was created to evaluate athletic intelligence, including the more dynamic cognitive that has been shown to predict performance better than the more traditional and academic cognitive tasks.
149 minor league baseball players from the same organization completed the AIQ assessment before the start of a season from which performance statistics were extracted. There were 73 position players and 76 pitchers.Four scores were used from the results of the AIQ to test its relationship with baseball performance:
For hitters, visual spatial processing was the most significant predictor of performance.
It showed a significant relationship with a hitting composite score, batting average, and OPS. On the pitching side, learning efficiency showed a significant correlation with FIP.
Even though the correlations between athlete intelligence and performance were weak, there may be some real opportunity here in the future. The correct answer is probably where it always is—it depends, and the key to success lies in multiple strengths.Intelligence and impressive cognition alone will not compensate for poor physical ability, or vice versa. But between this study and some previous literature, it’s clear that there is opportunity in non-physical aspects of athlete development.
We just have to keep digging to figure out how we can incorporate that to reach an athlete’s true potential.

Baseball pitching performance depends on energy flow through the kinetic chain.
One of the more recent studies looking at energy flow through the kinetic chain went one step further by also separating what portions of energy flow could be attributed to energy generation, absorption, and transfer.
Wasserberger et al. used 3D motion capture to record the mechanics of 40 youth pitchers. They then used the linear and angular velocities of the torso and arm as well as shoulder and elbow kinetics to separate the energy flow through the trunk, upper arm, and forearm into energy generation, absorption, and transfer across the shoulder and elbow joint.
These energetic measures were then related to ball speed and more traditional measures of pitching arm stress like elbow valgus torque and shoulder rotation torque.
What they found was that energy transfer was responsible for the majority of energy flow between the trunk, upper arm, and forearm indicating that the majority of energy generation likely happens more proximally in the kinetic chain (like in the pelvis or torso).
They additionally found significant amounts of energy absorption during arm deceleration and follow through providing evidence for the large eccentric demands placed on the elbow and shoulder musculature following ball release.
This means there might be other types of loading on the arm that we should pay attention to in the shoulder outside of just elbow valgus torque.
Energy-based analyses may offer additional player development insights by giving us a more holistic view of the demands placed on the pitching arm.
For example, previous studies show low shoulder rotation torques during arm deceleration and follow through. If we treat shoulder rotation torque as the only measure of shoulder stress, we would (wrongfully) assume that the shoulder isn’t at risk following ball release.
However, energy flow analysis revealed increased demands (due to increased energy absorption) during deceleration and follow-through giving us a more complete picture of the demands placed on the shoulder.
A more complete picture of throwing arm stresses could help us better manage throwing workloads to maximize pitcher development and performance. It could also help us more optimally progress injured athletes back during their throwing rehab.
____
Back on the theme of cognition and mental processes, Wu et al. in Taiwan looked into what is called mindfulness training, also known as a mindful-based intervention (MBI) and some of its effects on archery competitors.
Mindfulness is an idea that seems to balance somewhere between the cognition and psychologic function realm, but some believe it may be able to affect physical performance as well.
This experiment involved 23 archers who completed a four-week MBI training period at two sessions per week.
All athletes were tested before, in the middle, and after the training period with an archery shooting performance task, a cognitive function test, and three questionnaires to evaluate their psychological states.
The authors found that after the four-week intervention, the mean shooting accuracy (archery performance) and mean reaction time (cognition) significantly improved.
The primary limitation of this study is the lack of a control group, so we don’t know if the participants got better between pre and post tests because of their training programs, familiarity with the tests, or some other factor that was unaccounted for.
Either way, mindfulness is something that many people believe is good for health and performance.
There are also a lot of anecdotes and stories that seem to be very pseudo-science driven, but it’s possible that getting into a more stable and healthy psychological state could help with physical performance.
After all, Yogi Berra once declared, “Baseball is ninety percent mental. The other half is physical.”

Putting ForceHooks to the test - Driveline Baseball,2021-07-02T00:45:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/07/putting-forcehooks-to-the-test/,"ForceHooks are a portable dynamometer that can be secured to a weight room rack as shown below. The other end of the device is modular, currently featuring an eye bolt, a hook designed to secure a barbell, and an open attachment for handheld resistance measurements.
The ability to secure between a barbell and a rack is groundbreaking in that the device can be used to measure any barbell isometric exercise. This could make for a portable setup for the Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull (IMTP), like what we use in our strength assessment process. However, it could be done without the need for force plates or tests of which the output would be difficult to measure, even with force plates (i.e., an isometric row).
Before implementing the ForceHooks with our athletes in any capacity, we needed to validate the device’s accuracy. Using our portable dual-force plates from ForceDecks, we were able to set up an IMTP rig as shown below.
To reduce potential error that could occur from the setup of the rig and not the devices, we placed a plywood layer under the plates to account for the slight give of the rubber gym flooring. We also opted for a stiff 29mm power bar in place of a typical barbell to minimize the bend of the bar during the pull.
With a sample size of 65 trials, we compared the full signal force traces from the ForceHooks to the force plates and then calculated the difference between the two signals at each sample.
To get a better idea of how the magnitude of the pull affects the error of the hooks we also looked at a Bland Altman plot which illustrates how the error changes across varying magnitudes of a measure. This tells us if the error in measurement changes when a trial shows high vs. average or low forces.
Here is what we found:
With an average max force error of -28.97 N (~1%) and an r^2 for the full force trace of 0.979, we feel very confident implementing the ForceHooks. Their versatility will open up new isometric assessment options that previously were not feasible, including potentially expanding our strength assessment to include upper body force production.

Bat Fitting: The Physics of Choosing a Bat - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-21T23:44:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/bat-fitting-the-physics-of-choosing-a-bat/,"As hitters, we can often assess and address an area of weakness in our swing. However, we rarely perform a similar assessment on our equipment to see if it is either improving our swing or amplifying our swing flaws. As of right now, many of us choose our bat based on what “feels” the best.
If we get a little scientific, we can begin to develop a hypothesis as to what bat might best suit our unique swing characteristics. It’s possible that the right bat could positively influence our batted ball statistics. Given how difficult hitting is, it’s worth investigating anything that can give us a boost in the box.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
If I’m a college or high school athlete, will every 33in 30oz bat I pick up be the exact same? Of course not. We will focus primarily on the difference in each bat’s “Moment of Inertia”, or MOI.
Moment of Inertia: A quantity expressing a body’s tendency to resist angular acceleration.
This is a measurement of how difficult it is to change the rotational velocity of an object that is rotating around a “pivot point”. In baseball, the industry standard for measuring MOI starts with a pivot point six inches above the knob. Six inches is significant because this is roughly where most hitters’ grips will end.A bat’s MOI will tell us where the majority of the weight is situated on the bat. The two overload Axe Bat Speed Trainers are a perfect example for this.
If you were to put a 33 inch version of both the barrel-loaded and handle-loaded bat speed trainers on a scale, they would both display the same weight: 36 oz. Upon picking up and swinging each bat, however, you’d quickly notice that swinging the barrel load is much more difficult than swinging the handle load. The reason is that these bats have very different MOI values.
As weight is distributed towards the end cap of a bat, the MOI goes up. If weight is distributed down towards the handle, the MOI goes down. This means it will require much less force to rotate a bat with a lower MOI around a pivot point.
That might make immediate sense to you, but if you’d like to get a feel for it, grab a bat and take two swings, one with your hands in the usual position on the grip and the other holding the barrel. Which required more effort?
Now we need to answer the question, “How might the difference in MOIs affect my swing or outcomes?” If you’ve ever swung the Axe Bat Speed Trainers, I’m sure you’ve noticed the differences between the two. The barrel-loaded trainer requires more force, making it much more difficult to rotate, resulting in slower bat speeds. Additionally, the higher MOI makes the barrel load more difficult to manipulate and adjust.
On the handle-loaded bat speed trainer, the extra weight is closer to the body’s midline. This weight distribution is in a much more adjustable position, which allows us to rotate the bat at greater velocities.
Figure skaters are a great example of this concept. If you’ve ever seen a figure skater spinning on the ice, they bring their limbs tighter into a more proximal position (close to the body) in order to spin faster.
When trying to slow down their spin, they move their limbs from a proximal to a distal (away from the body) position, moving the weight farther from their midline. This same idea holds true for MOI in the bats we decided to use: the closer the weight is to the body, the easier it will be to swing the bat faster.
Assuming the concept above, using a bat with a lower MOI will allow you to rotate the bat faster, increase your bat speed, and decrease your time to contact, letting you make decisions later in the swing. A lower MOI bat will also produce increased bat to ball skills (smash factor). Because that weight is closer to the hands, we should be able to adjust and manipulate the bat much easier.
The opposite is true for a bat with a higher MOI. Because the weight is further away from the hands, it is now in a position that makes it more difficult to rotate the barrel at faster velocities, in turn decreasing bat speed. This end-loaded weight distribution also makes it more difficult to manipulate the barrel and adjust during the swing.
However, the fact that you can swing a bat with a lower MOI faster than a bat with a higher MOI does not mean you will be hitting the ball harder.
Let’s consider Newton’s 2nd law: “Force equals mass times acceleration” (F=ma). Removing mass from the barrel will decrease a bat’s MOI and increase bat speed (acceleration). However, the loss of mass has a significant effect of its own, often resulting in less force being transferred from the bat into the ball, and ultimately lower exit velocities. To simplify, in order to take advantage of the exit velocity benefits from adding bat speed to your swing, you would need to make those bat speed gains while swinging a bat with the same or similar MOI.

One begins to wonder if baseball will eventually follow golf’s lead as far as “fitting” the athlete with equipment based on their unique swing characteristics. Consider an athlete with an abnormally high whiff rate, but high peak exit velocity. This athlete is more than likely using a bat with a relatively high MOI. The higher MOI makes it more difficult to adjust during the swing, which could contribute to the high whiff rate.
That said, when the barrel does meet the ball, the position of mass in the barrel results in impressively high exit velocity. In theory, switching to a bat with a lower MOI could decrease this athlete’s whiff rate and improve their barrel percentage. However, this would come at the cost of slightly lowering their peak exit velocity.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, an athlete with impressive bat to ball skills who rarely swings and misses but shows abnormally low exit velocities might benefit from using a bat with a slightly higher MOI. This athlete has a little more room to swing and miss. But with a higher MOI bat, his batted balls will have increased exit velocity and become more valuable.
Another idea stemming from golf is to let the situation dictate the equipment. A golfer holds fourteen clubs in their bag, meaning that, given the situation, there are fourteen different implements to choose from to maximize the opportunity at success. In the future, if we are able to develop correlations from a bat’s MOI to its batted ball characteristics, you might actually see hitters swinging different bats in different situations.
For example, it’s a tie ball game, bottom of the 9th, runner on 3rd, less than 2 outs, and the infield is playing in. The goal is very clear: get the runner home and you win the game. If a player produces a higher average launch angle while using a bat with a higher MOI compared to a bat with a lower MOI, then a higher MOI bat would be a good choice here.
This is just one example of many, considering what we know already. To give another example, as mentioned above, a lower MOI bat would improve a hitter’s bat speed, thus decreasing time to contact. If this hitter were facing a high velocity pitcher, the decreased time to contact and added adjustability would benefit the hitter.
The hope is that in the future we will follow golf’s lead and use a hitter’s unique swing characteristics to hone in on the most optimal bat recommendations.

Caught Looking: June 2021 - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-21T00:46:16+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/caught-looking-june-2021/,"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33930560/
Since velocity is an important piece of pitching performance and one of the primary measures of player development, how increased velocity affects the physical demands on the pitcher’s arm is important to understand. This relationship has been studied before by ASMI’s group, and a study by Manzi et al. using data collected by Motus Global in the past just took another look at it. 91 professional pitchers were included in this analysis.
Manzi and the authors of this study published in April 2021 arrived at a similar conclusion: the inter-subject correlation (including all 91 athletes) is not strong, but the intra-subject correlation (looking at a single-subject’s throws), is very strong. For example, this means that when an athlete throws a 90 mph fastball, the associated elbow torque for that throw is also likely going to be higher than if that athlete throws an 85 mph fastball. But when you compare an athlete who throws 90 mph to a different athlete who throws 85 mph, the 90 mph thrower may not necessarily have a higher elbow torque for those throws than the athlete who throws 85 mph.
This is likely because there are many other differences between athletes that contribute to their elbow torque during the throw including (but not limited to) height, body composition, and technique. However, all that means is that there is more “noise” in the relationship. More noise just means that within a tight velocity or torque window, the relationship might not be that strong but if you were to compare a 65 mph thrower to a 90 mph thrower, you would likely see a big difference in elbow torque. That is what we see when we look at our entire biomechanics database which includes athletes of all levels from youth to MLB pitchers.
You can see a clear curvilinear relationship (curved line; a logarithmic relationship in this case) between elbow torque (x-axis) and pitch velocity (y-axis). A curvilinear relationship means that even though it’s not a straight linear relationship, velocity goes up as elbow torque goes up, just at a non consistent rate. Manzi et al. touch on this in the limitations, but broadening the sample of velocities and playing levels has an effect on the inter-subject relationship; their study only looked at professional pitchers.
Conclusion: it requires more force and torque to create elite fastball velocity than sub-elite fastball velocity. This makes managing that load on the body all the more important. Luckily, there are ways that athletes can measure and manage their workload. For more information, see our post about managing starting pitchers’ workloads.

Recent improvements in virtual reality present some pretty intriguing opportunities for adding to training methods in sports. Interceptive sports that require a high degree of coordination also require highly specific training; training to recognize a dot on a screen likely doesn’t have the same effect on a hitter’s ability to detect pitch type as training against live pitchers. The cool thing about virtual reality is that we might be able to recreate this live training environment in a virtual world, making it much more accessible to athletes who want to get more reps in.
One major concern however, is that if the virtual reality is not similar enough to an actual live setting, training with it may not work that great either. It could either not transfer well to competition, or even worse, it may train the skill negatively. It’s possible that training in a virtual environment might make you better in the virtual environment while also making you worse in the actual game. Not to say that is the most likely outcome, but it would require some creative research to ensure the training adaptations are net positive.
Oagaz et al. at the University of Colorado, Denver created a virtual reality (VR) ping pong training system and tested it out in an actual ping pong task. The system was tested by separating the subjects into two groups: an experimental group (9 people) and a control group (also 9 people). The control group didn’t do any training at all, so the experiment was comparing the virtual reality training to no training. This is because this is a new and introductory type of training.
The authors found that the VR training improved ping pong skill relative to no training at all. Between the pre and post test, the group that received VR training improved on ball speed and ball height but not on total number of returned balls. These were the only ping pong performance measures they test
These results do not necessarily mean that we can throw together a virtual baseball field and start training against animated opponents, but results like these are very exciting for the future of baseball training. Especially in a sport where every rep can have a significant impact on player health, virtual training has the ability to truly change how players, coaches, and organizations approach long term development.

Pitcher evaluation and development places a lot of focus on kinematic sequencing and the efficiency with which a pitcher transfers energy from the lower body segments, up through the arm, and to the ball. There is a set standard that a proximal-to-distal sequencing (PDS) is ideal.
In practice, this sequence is identified by the timing and order at which specific segments (typically pelvis, trunk, upper arm, forearm, and hand) reach their peak angular velocity. Aspects of the kinematic sequence in pitching and its relationship to injury risk factors have been a large focus of baseball biomechanics research. This study by Scarborough, et al. from 2020 introduces the first look at categorizing kinematic sequences and evaluating the relationship between them and biomechanical indicators of potential risk.
Scarborough, et al. took 3D motion capture data from 249 pitches thrown by 30 pitchers and categorized them by the kinematic sequencing pattern demonstrated in each pitch. The standard was based off of the PDS order of sequencing:
Those that followed that order were the PDS group. Those that differed were placed into groups defined by the first segment to be ‘out-of-order’ (pelvis/trunk – CORE group, Upper Arm – PUE group, Forearm – DUE group).
After comparing biomechanical indicators of potential risk (absolute shoulder torques, both external rotation and extension, and elbow valgus torques) between the different groups, this study corroborated the findings that the PDS group produced lower amounts of stress on the throwing arm. Shoulder ER and elbow valgus torques were the highest in the DUE group.
An interesting detail to note is that no pitches thrown in the study followed the 12345 order exactly. The closest was 12344, with forearm and hand angular velocities peaking at the same time, and those made up the PDS group. Additionally, the pitches in the PDS group were only 12% of the total number of pitches thrown in the study.
While this study backs the concept of proximal-to-distal energy transfer being ‘ideal’, it gives more insight into the implications of specific kinematic sequences that differ from this standard. It also highlights the variability, within an individual, to demonstrate different sequencing. These results introduce a new way to categorize kinetic sequencing and analyze or evaluate an individual based on which sequencing they demonstrate most frequently.

Count-Dependent Pitch Quality - Driveline Baseball,2021-06-14T00:57:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/06/count-dependent-pitch-quality/,"In the first part of the series, we took a stab at the what (which pitches), when (which counts), why (quality-command tradeoff), and how (velocity, movement) behind pitchers changing their pitch profiles depending on the count of an at-bat. There were notable velocity and movement differences across the league depending on if the pitcher was ahead, even, or behind in the count. This piece will utilize Stuff+ to investigate how pitchers manipulate the quality of their pitches depending on the count, count-specific pitch quality behavior, as well as list pitchers who stood out amongst the rest of the league.
To review, the motivation behind manipulating pitch profiles with respect to the count can be explained by a quality-command tradeoff. While ahead, pitchers are often looking to exploit their leverage in the count by upping their pitch quality via some combination of velocity and movement to achieve a called strike or swing and miss while the penalty for a ball is low.
Simply put, they throw their nastiest stuff when the reward for a whiff is high and the consequence of a ball is low. On the contrary, when behind in the count, the penalty for throwing a ball is higher, therefore, command normally takes a slight precedence over pitch quality. In this instance, some pitchers may sacrifice pitch quality, within reason, in favor of locating the baseball to get back in the count.
By bucketing counts into ahead, even, and behind by pitcher on a league-wide scale, we can see pitcher behavior of pitch types in each count. Amongst all pitch types, pitchers displayed a 6.5 and 4.8 bump in stuff+ while ahead compared to behind and even, respectively. This backs the initial theory that pitchers get nastier while they’re ahead, specifically with two strikes, on purpose. On the flipside, there is little difference in pitch quality between even count and behind count pitches.
We can also see the influence that the count weighs on the pitch quality of individual pitch types. The quality of curveballs and sliders were most improved while ahead, while changeups were largely unaffected by count.  In theory, the “get-me-over” and “put-away” labels normally apply to breaking balls and, as we saw in the previous blog, breaking balls tend to have more intentional variation in velocity and movement than other pitch types. As a result, it makes sense that the quality of sliders and curveballs varies more drastically than other pitches.
Digging deeper, when we break down each pitch type by their respective counts, we observe that there is a very clear trend of increased pitch quality transitioning from hitter friendly to pitcher friendly counts.
For example, we see a major bump in pitch quality in two-strike counts when pitchers are looking to punch tickets, likely for two reasons. First, as shown in Table 1, pitchers consciously improve the quality of their offerings when they get ahead. Second, pitchers also throw their nastiest pitches with two strikes, tossing their best pitch type when they need a whiff.
We can see this effect quite clearly when looking at 0-0 CBs, where hitters see more “get-me-over” pitches with an average stuff+ for curveballs of 89.1, about 11 percent below league average in terms of pitch quality. However, in 0-2 counts, hitters see CBs with an  average stuff+ of 116, 16 percent above league average. The difference in stuff+ between the 0-2 and 0-0 curveball is just about 27%, a very substantial change in the quality of pitch, which represents improvements in velocity and movement.
Across all pitch types, pitchers will throw roughly league average pitches in all counts excluding two-strike counts and 3-0. The 3-0 obviously sees a massive drop in pitch quality, as the sole purpose of the 3-0 count is to throw a strike knowing most of the time (not all the time) the batter isn’t going to swing. In two-strike counts, all pitch types are thrown with an average stuff+ of 107-108.6, the highest of any other counts, and for good reason.
This gives us a general scope of league wide pitch quality behavior. Due to the volatility of pitch profiles, some pitchers stood out from the league by how they manipulated their pitches. The next section will identify outliers in the league, as well as in-depth examples of certain pitchers.
Listed below are the MLB outliers in changing the velocity, movement, and quality of their pitches. For simplicity, only ahead-behind count differences are included.
This table represents the pitches that have the largest differences in profile or pitch quality in ahead counts compared to behind. Within the outliers, some of them were rather interesting. Seth Lugo’s ahead-count fastball (150 stuff+) is nearly 50 percent better in terms of raw stuff compared to his behind-count fastball (104 stuff+), mostly due to a velocity difference of 2.3 mph. Yu Darvish throws his cutter almost 5mph harder with a gain of 4.7in of vertical in ahead counts versus behind. Cam Hill’s slider gains an additional 4.8 inches of sweep.
Tyler Clippard’s changeup sticks out because he throws a traditional changeup in even/behind counts and a split-grip variation in ahead counts. As a result, Clippard’s changeups have the greatest velocity and movement differences in the league due to a massive difference in spin direction and spin rate.
More on them in detail below.

Patrick Corbin’s slider has been one of the most successful and consistently effective sliders in recent years and has played a major role in his ability to be a successful big league starter. Looking at his splits by count, his slider movement from 2020 doesn’t change depending on the count, however it is possible it changes due to other factors (batter handedness, scouting reports, hitter swing feedback). However, in the table above, we can see that he throws the pitch substantially harder depending on the count. It is rare for a pitcher to add velocity to a breaking ball without sacrificing some spin efficiency in the process.
On average, Corbin throws his slider 2.6 mph harder in ahead counts than behind. For context, sliders averaged a bump of 0.57 mph in ahead counts compared to behind in the 2020 season. Corbin threw his slider 4.5-times harder in ahead counts compared to behind relative to the behavior of the league, which results in an increase of 12.7 stuff+ while ahead and a 9.9 bump in stuff+ even counts compared to his behind count profile.
Our model has had difficulty reflecting the effectiveness of Corbin’s slider, as it grades well-below MLB average across all counts in terms of pitch quality despite his continued success with the pitch. It is likely Corbin is able to achieve impressive results from a rather pedestrian profile by exceptional command, pitch tunneling, and his ability to manipulate the speed of the pitch to disrupt hitter timing in various counts.
Patrick Corbin has an absolutely filthy slider. Turns out, he’s been gripping it the same exact way since he was a kid. His dad (!) taught him the grip. It’s the same grip he uses for his curveball. So many cool nuggets came out of this Behind the Seams pic.twitter.com/aB6KcEzZIb

With a confirmed 10 different pitches, there’s little room on a break chart that Darvish doesn’t occupy and that’s clearly evident by watching him pitch. Darvish has stated he possesses a “slow cutter” and a “cut fastball,” which are both labeled as cutters, but not the same pitch in terms of profile and how he uses them. His cutter is one of the largest count-dependent profiles in all of baseball. Where some pitchers may alter some aspect of the pitch, Darvish significantly changes this pitch across the board for velocity, shape, and movement. For velocity, his cutter comes in, on average, 4.3 mph harder in ahead counts compared to behind. That manipulation of intent also brings a change in shape. His profile has a massive shift in spin axis from 98 degrees/9:16 (slider shape) to 145 degrees/10:50 (cutter shape), trading sweep and depth for lift and velocity in ahead counts.
It can be assumed the slower version is primarily for getting back in counts, stealing strikes, and locating with an easier profile to control. The ahead count cut-fastball is thrown with maximum intent to produce a swing and miss. While both types are above league average, his ahead count, harder cutter has a stuff+ of 135, while the behind-count, slower cutter is 120, so his ahead count cutter is 15 percent better in terms of raw stuff compared to the cutter he throws behind in the count. This is likely a compromise he makes in order to improve accuracy, as the importance of a behind count pitch is throwing a strike, rather than getting a hitter to chase.

Tyler Glasnow’s curveball is one of the best pitches in all of baseball. His 12-6 has an average spin rate just beneath 3,000 rpms, is thrown very hard, and has plus movement. When we break down his curveball profile by count, he saw one of the biggest pitch quality differences in the league, but was just beneath the minimum sample required for behind-count pitches to be included amongst the league outliers. The theory here is simple: he throws his curveball harder when he is ahead in the count, specifically, 2.1 mph harder, which results in his stuff+ skyrocketing from 140.59 while behind, to 205.70 while ahead, a difference of 65.1.

Mentioned in the previous blog, Sergio Romo owes the vast majority of his career success to his ability to throw a slider. Contrary to the norm, Romo throws his slider more than any other pitch in his arsenal, using it 64.6 percent of the time in 2020, good for the highest mark of his career. Since 2008, Sergio Romo has a .225 wOBA against his slider.
As you can see from the break chart above, his slider takes on many different shapes, due to Romo intentionally manipulating the shape and speed of the pitch. It is likely that Romo manipulates his slider based on a variety of conditions such as scouting reports, batter swing feedback, or batter handedness, but we also see the count of the at-bat plays a role as well.
Romo’s slider behavior is actually counterintuitive in that it decreased in quality last season when he was in advantageous counts, largely due to an increase in velocity while behind. In ahead counts, Romo shows an increase of both spin and spin efficiency, which results in a 4-5 inch increase in sweep in ahead counts. Where the trend from the rest of the league has been increasing velocity when ahead, it looks like Romo is going for more sweep when he is looking for a punchout.
In the interview below for Jomboy Media, Sergio talks about his mindset behind the slider when he struck out Miguel Cabrera for the last out in the 2012 World Series. While discussing his sequencing, he talks about his 0-0 slider he likes to throw “to get a strike if I’m trying to get ahead or if a guy hasn’t faced me, different look.” When he gets ahead on Cabrera, he says “I gotta throw him my best strikeout one right here.” While his pitch quality technically decreased when he got ahead, the bigger movement profile may be better suited for whiffs rather than raw run values, giving Romo a very specific slider for a very specific circumstance.

Hill’s slider led the league with the largest difference in horizontal break in ahead counts compared to behind. This is evident qualitatively by the width of slider movement on his break chart. When we look at his profiles, his slider gained an extra 4.8 inches of sweep in ahead counts due to a significant increase in spin efficiency from 44.6 percent while behind to 64.8 perfect while ahead. This change resulted in a jump of 20 stuff+ for his ahead count slider. During his debut season in 2020, Hill’s slider proved to be a major weapon for him with a wOBA of .168 and a whiff% of 43.3 percent. While it may not be directly tied to the success of Hill’s slider, it is possible his ability to produce greater gloveside movement contributed to the effectiveness of the pitch in ahead counts, especially with two strikes, as well as his ability to flash it for strikes when necessary.
CIRCLE CHANGEUP: https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=55608537-2fee-4383-84ea-8752bc80877b
SPLIT CHANGE: https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=4e0a5ffb-f73e-4d81-a519-647abba24475
The profile differences for Tyler Clippard’s changeup nearly jump off the page as he led the league in multiple categories. Across the board, the pitch is considerably different in velocity, spin, shape movement, and pitch quality. His ahead count changeup is 2.6mph harder while losing ~500 rpms, 10.6 inches of run, and 12 inches of lift. On paper, you would assume they are two entirely different pitches… and that’s because they are.
Upon viewing in-game video of his changeup during ahead counts and behind, it is clear he throws a split-finger variation strictly while ahead, and a circle changeup during even and behind counts. This explains the increase in velocity and massive drop in movement seen, as the split-finger grip kills spin and can result in a drop in spin efficiency.
The mindset of the split-finger variation while ahead for Clippard is likely to achieve whiffs with something harder with a more north-south movement profile than the standard changeup. Normally, pitchers make these changes to improve their offerings in two strike counts, while Clippard counterintuitively decreases his stuff+ by 30-40 compared to his changeup in other counts. Although the quality of the pitch decreases, it is possible the north-south, split-grip changeup is better suited to miss barrels in two-strike counts than the horizontal fashion of the standard changeup.
Understanding how pitchers change their pitches relative to count states is potentially important and can be a strategy in player development. While it may not be wise to recommend every pitcher should have two shapes of every pitch or throw pitches differently depending on the count, there are certain scenarios where manipulating the velocity or shape of the pitch can help improve an athlete’s effectiveness on the bump. However, this likely takes a significant period of trial and error with finding something that works and actually accomplishes what we want. A few points to consider:
In a perfect world, a pitcher locates their best stuff and maximizes pitch quality in any count. In reality, there’s a reason these trends exist at the highest level of the game. The game of baseball evolves over time and for good reason. Successful trends and strategies stick, negative ones fade away. If there were no underlying benefits of manipulating pitch types, it is likely it would not have started occurring or continue to occur in the game today at the highest level.

Not just a pitching lab: The brand-new Driveline Sports Science Laboratory,2021-05-31T23:16:39+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/not-just-a-pitching-lab-the-brand-new-driveline-sports-science-laboratory/,"Over the last few months, we have been putting the finishing touches on a lab you might expect to see from the future—the biggest and baddest sport science lab in the industry.
The 5,000 square foot area will feature tens of new and upgraded motion capture cameras, high speed video, force measurements—you name it. More tech and more data will lead to more insights, in turn producing better athlete results.
Prior to the latest additions, the Driveline Sports Science Lab featured:
We’ve been using this to steadily build a massive database of pitching and hitting biomechanics—and now we’re adding force plates and other tech to it!
Here is a look our recent additions:
These additions allow for a more dynamic space where we can collect solely pitching biomechanics, solely hitting biomechanics, and even biomechanics from pitchers and hitters in live competition. This is all on top of the ever-progressing performance tracking (away from the lab) that we use in the training environment to steer training programs and improve athlete development.
Because of these additions and the ridiculous amount of data we will be able to collect in one area, the Driveline Sports Science Lab will be the new home of Driveline’s infamous live at-bats.
Live at-bats at Driveline have a special legacy—and they just got a lot better. Having multiple measurements for athlete assessments is obviously valuable for helping our coaches train athletes, but the more exciting part of having the world’s best sports science lab is that we can collect all of this data during live at-bats. Now, instead of bringing all the energy and some of the data, we can bring all the energy and all the data.
Most high-precision biomechanics research happens in very controlled settings. Those controlled research settings represent a very different environment than what an actual game is like. Our new setup is extremely exciting for the same reasons it’s exciting to see Hawkeye being used in professional baseball stadiums—biomechanics research in the competitive environment is now possible, which creates the opportunity to generate a completely new dimension of insights.
How do biomechanics change throughout an at-bat? How do hitters adjust their load and stride against different types of pitchers? Can we figure out how to create more deception as a pitcher or how to combat it as a hitter using high speed video?We don’t know—but we are now a few steps closer to finding out.
With more athletes and more employees in the facility during the summer, there’s an opportunity to do some very interesting and important research. Outside of live at-bats and athlete assessments, here is a list of some studies we hope to collect data for this summer in the lab:

That’s absolutely right. What all of this technology does is deliver an objective measure of your movement and performance to aid our coaches in determining what you need the most. It also allows us to continue analyzing all of this data to learn what things are best at helping athletes improve.
So come to improve, or don’t. Either way, we will be here, continuing to push the boundaries of baseball player development and learning how to build baseball’s future monsters.

Caught Looking: May 2021 - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-14T00:47:20+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/caught-looking-may-2021/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this month.
As the baseball community continues to put more emphasis on manipulating pitched ball flight and spin characteristics, various groups have looked into legal ways to improve spin rate. Many of those investigations have involved grip strength measurements and hand size measurements. What those studies have lacked for the most part is wrist flexion and extension strength.
Wong et al. in a collaboration between the Texas Rangers, the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Texas Metroplex Institute did an investigation that included wrist strength to the typical measurements for these studies. With a sample of 90 professional pitchers, the following measurements were taken:
A model using the wrist strength measures–including peak force and the time taken to reach that peak force–explained a significant amount of variance in spin rate. The two most significant predictors in this model were wrist extension strength and radial deviation strength.
One thing to consider when interpreting these results is that the analysis was not controlled for fastball velocity. Since spin rate is positively related to velocity (as velocity goes up, so does spin rate), the results may lack some applicability for player development purposes. It’s possible that the relationship between wrist strength and spin rate was confounded by velocity, meaning the pitchers who had stronger wrists and higher spin rates may have also just thrown harder. If this were the case, it’s unlikely an athlete’s spin rate would increase just from gaining wrist strength without improving their velocity.
Nonetheless, these results definitely warrant a deeper look into the idea of wrist strength affecting spin rate. Coaches, athletes, and researchers for quite a while have been interested in how to improve spin rate without the use of foreign substances so the results from this study are very exciting for the world of pitching player development.
In amateur baseball, starting position on the pitching rubber is something that pitching coaches and athletes tweak to hopefully improve some type of outcome for the pitcher. For myself, it was always to make an adjustment in my pitch location if I kept missing to the same side. It was also a way for me to avoid stepping in craters created from myself and other pitchers since high school pitching mounds aren’t also maintained very well.
As the baseball community continues to find quantitative ways to become more deceptive and effective as a pitcher, specifically with pitch movement, starting position on the rubber can be added to the list of things for pitchers to use to their advantage. Depending on the way your pitches move, there could be advantages to adjusting the position on the mound that you pitch from.
All of this to say that if starting from a different position on the rubber leads to adverse mechanical effects for pitchers who change their starting position that also could lead to a decrease in performance or health, it is probably not worth the change. Slowik et al. at ASMI looked at these biomechanical effects with a very large biomechanics database. They separated the sample into four groups–pitchers who:
These were all between-groups comparisons, meaning they didn’t study the change in mechanics of the same player when moving them from one side of the rubber to the other but instead just compared pitchers who exhibited the above characteristics. Each group had 36 pitchers
The authors found that shoulder horizontal adduction at ball release (how far out front the pitcher releases the ball) and maximum shoulder internal rotation velocity exhibited non-trivial (meaningful) difference between groups. Both effects were small, however.
There was also an interaction effect (the combination of stride direction and rear foot positioning mattered) which could explain the difference in peak shoulder internal rotation velocity (since higher velo is associated with higher arm speed). A difference in shoulder horizontal adduction at ball release also makes sense, since those who stride closed, toward the third base dugout for righties and first base dugout for legites, the arm will have to be more out front at release to compensate for the stride direction.
As with the spin rate study above, since these comparisons were not made within-subjects by measuring mechanics from the same person starting on both sides of the rubber, we can’t necessarily apply these findings to a situation when an athlete changes their starting position but in the grand scheme–there are very few mechanical differences from different starting positions on the mound. If it helps a pitcher be more successful in the game, it should definitely be considered as a reasonable strategic change.
Energy flow between body segments in baseball pitching delivery have recently become more popular in applied biomechanics labs. Dr. Aguinaldo’s group at PLNU has done a lot of work with induced power analysis to decompose active and passive contributions to power in the arm. Dr. Oliver’s group at Auburn University, including one of our incredible sports science interns Kyle Wasserberger, has done a lot of biomechanical modeling of energy flow through various joints in athletic movements as well. When combining the results of these studies with some work we have done with rotational velocity and energy using our internal datasets, it has been made clear that trunk movement is very important in the throw.
Diego da Silva Carvalho et al. in Brazil looked into power flow throughout an instep soccer kick. 18 soccer players were assessed for instep kicking using 3D motion capture and force plates. With some relatively complex biomechanical modelling, the authors were able to calculate the flow of power throughout the segments using joint torques and joint displacements (basically just doing some cool math) to study how power propagates throughout the body during the instep kick.
The reason I am discussing a soccer biomechanics study in this edition of Caught Looking is because of their conclusion. The authors found that the energy during the kick flows downward in the following order:
This is interesting because of the work that has been done in baseball biomechanics labs where it is clear the trunk is a very important part of generating and transferring power and energy throughout the movement. As with quite a few of the studies that we often highlight on this blog series, it won’t necessarily change the way we train athletes, but it absolutely highlights the importance of the trunk’s movement in explosive movements and should be treated appropriately when training as a player or when evaluating an athlete’s needs as a coach.

Predicted Velocity Through Jump and Strength Testing - Driveline Baseball,2021-05-04T00:31:08+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/05/predicted-pitch-velocity/,"As we’ve collected data through our force plate strength assessment, trainees commonly ask exactly how those physical qualities show up in their sport skill (hitting or pitching). Examining how high performance metrics from our force plate assessment directionally relates with skill outcomes is a strong area of interest for us and we wanted to go beyond correlational analyses and build out our own in-house predictive models.
Our High Performance R&D Intern, Anthony Osnacz, did just this, using our force plate data to investigate how the physical qualities measured in our jump and strength assessments show up on the mound or in the batter’s box. The current model we use to predict pitch velocity—this specific piece talks about using force plate metrics to predict a pitcher’s fastball velocity; position players’ data is used to predict bat speed—from our force plate assessments takes physical qualities in a vacuum—absent any skill, intent, readiness, or any of the many other factors important for a pitcher.
Our in-house models are not intended to tell us, “If you have x force plate metrics, you will throw y velocity.” Rather, they say, “If you have x force plate metrics, we would expect you to throw y velocity, with all other variables equal.” This allows trainers to quickly determine whether an athlete’s actual mound results are out-or underperforming their predicted fastball velocities, therefore allowing us to quickly identify and communicate lowest hanging fruit for a pitcher’s training.
Athletes A and B (velocities shown in table below) have a similar predicted fastball velocity from their force plate profiles, but their actual motion capture tests are 16 mph apart. This helps demonstrate how two similar force plate tests can result in different training recommendations.
The typical interpretation for Athlete A’s mound velocity outperforming his predicted velocity was that his throwing skill was outperforming his general physical qualities, and with that in mind his lowest hanging fruit this offseason was improving the physical areas he lacked the most. This meant allocating more of his training economy to building strength and power in the weight room and less training economy to specific throwing work.
Athlete B is in essentially the opposite situation, with his mocap velocity underperforming his predicted velocity. Typically, an athlete in this situation needs a focus on the skill side, so this offseason he had throwing work emphasized, with reduced volume in the weight room reflected in his training economy balance.
In the past we’ve implemented ordinary least squares regression models to predict throwing velocity off of force plate metrics, but now with a larger sample size we decided to re-run the analysis using some different methods.
We split the data 75/25 into training and test datasets respectively, then we trained a few multi-linear regression models. After an examination of relevant feature impact, multicollinearity, and error diagnostics/residual behavior (among other factors), we settled on a model with a 2.7 MAE (mean absolute error; in other words, on average the model was +/- 2.7 mph off of an athlete’s actual average velocity) and R^2 of 0.54.
The metrics that are weighted the heaviest in the model are Squat Jump Peak Power (W), RSI-modified (m/s) from the Countermovement Jump, the Reactive Strength Index (Flight Time / Ground Contact Time) recorded during the Hop Test, and Net Peak Force (N) from the Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull. All the aforementioned independent variables shared a Variance Inflation Factor under 5, which was an encouraging sign towards managing multicollinearity. Current limitations of the model include not accounting for anatomical differences such as limb length and not having any information on an athlete’s upper body strength or power.

Count-dependent Pitch Profile Manipulation - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-26T00:59:36+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/count-dependent-pitch-profile-manipulation/,"“That’s my put-away pitch”
“That’s my get-me-over pitch”
If you’re a coach, player, or have simply been around the game long enough, there’s a good chance you’ve heard a pitcher make comments similar to the ones above. There’s nothing too crazy about that, as, at its core, the idea is that some pitchers intentionally alter the shape of a pitch type depending on the context of a given at-bat, sequence, or game-state in order to gain a slight edge.
However, what’s less understood is just how many pitchers intentionally manipulate the shape of their pitches depending on circumstances, as well as how much they’re willing to adjust a pitch’s shape overall.
Rather than focus on pitch type consistency or overall variance of a pitch’s given shape (which includes both intentional and unintentional pitch manipulation), this blog will attempt to analyze just the intentional variance MLB pitchers impart to their given pitch types over the course of a given season. Specifically, we’ll look at which pitchers change a pitch’s basic shape on purpose, when they do it, and by how much they switch things up.
Before we can get into the intentional manipulation of pitch types, we felt it’d be important to touch on the natural, inherent causes of pitch shape variation that every pitcher experiences when on the bump. These factors include but are not limited to:
These factors contribute to changing a pitch profile unintentionally, while other components such as count, batter handedness, scouting reports, hitter swings, the number of times a hitter has seen a certain pitch in a single at-bat, and the times through the order penalty may lead to intentional changes of pitch shape.
Pitchers make these changes to improve pitch effectiveness through the manipulation of velocity and shape, as one version of the pitch may be more effective in the current situation than another.
If intentional profile manipulation does occur, we believe that the count has the biggest influence.
As mentioned above, pitchers often refer to a pitch they would throw in behind counts, and sometimes in even counts, as their “get-me-over” version. This version is thrown to steal a strike or when they have a suspicion that the batter is looking for a different pitch type. For example, the “get-me-over” version works largely due to the count and situation, as a batter is usually not sitting curveball in 0-0 and 2-0 counts, and a pitcher knows they don’t need to throw their nastiest curveball in that situation to achieve a positive outcome. Thus, the focus here is less on maximizing pitch quality and more on location and reliance on the likelihood that the hitter will take or, if they swing, be off timing.
In some cases, a pitcher will throw a lesser version of a pitch (in terms of movement and velocity) earlier in the count and “save the good one” for when they need a swing and miss, as they don’t want the hitter to see and adjust to the better version. In this situation, the “best one” or “put-away” version of a pitch is the one that is most likely to produce a swing and miss or strike out later in the count, when that outcome is more achievable and beneficial.
With this in mind, it is no surprise that velocity varies depending on the count; pitchers tend to increase the intensity when they’re ahead in the count as generally they are more focused on achieving a whiff, rather than locating. It is logical that a pitcher would increase intent on their heater in an 0-2 count rather than in a 3-1 count because the consequences of missing aren’t equal. If you miss in the 3-1 count, the batter walks. If you miss 0-2, you are 1-2 and still in command of the at-bat. Aside from velocity, there are pitchers who strive for a certain shape in a certain count.
While theoretically this strategy may not seem novel, it is still relatively unknown whether this change in intent actually results in distinct movement profiles. The rest of this blog will tackle normal variance in pitch profiles, significant arsenal deviations, and league-wide tendencies.
To start, we’ll use the common break chart to qualitatively view the deviation of a certain pitch, where horizontal and vertical movement are plotted from the pitcher’s perspective.
A pitcher who is consistent with their pitch shapes will have well defined clusters for every pitch type and standard movement deviation. Take Blake Snell’s break chart, for example, which features distinct clusters that can be clearly identified for each pitch type.
Rather than focus on pitchers like Snell who largely stay consistent with pitch shape regardless of the game and count state, the primary focus of this blog will be the pitchers whose break charts are not as clean. In the examples below, pitch type clusters are not as tight and instead cover a wide range of movement for certain pitch types.
This qualitatively indicates that the pitchers listed are frequently manipulating the movement of their pitches depending on game context, most likely intentionally and with purpose.
The pitches in the images above that stick out are Sergio Romo and Dinelson Lamets’ sliders, Zac Gallen’s cutter, and Yu Darvish’s, well, everything. Given the sheer magnitude of variation in each offering, one can infer that at least some proportion of the variation in the shape of these pitch types is intentional. In some cases, there is a clear trend in the movement deviation that demonstrates its purpose.
For example, Zac Gallen’s cutter follows a very specific trend in which he manipulates the speed and vertical break of the pitch. His cutter has shown vertical break ranging positively near his fastball, near zero like a slider, and then negatively nearing his curveball. Depending on the count, the pitch takes a shape that could be classified objectively as a fastball, cutter, slider, and even a curveball.
Given that we do see some evidence that pitches can change shape on a pitch to pitch basis, it’s important to understand how they change on a league-wide scale, as well as what is considered a significant change. First, let’s look at average league-wide pitch profile behavior related to the count.
As we touched on previously, it is of no surprise that the velocity of different pitch types changes depending on the count. When looking across all pitch types thrown at the MLB level over the past 5 years, we observe that the average pitch is thrown ~.5mph harder when ahead in the count vs behind, and ~.37mph harder when ahead relative to even. Specifically, curveballs and four-seam fastballs were thrown the hardest when ahead, while the velocity of changeups and cutters were least affected by the count. Overall, left-handed pitchers threw their pitches harder in ahead counts compared to right-handed pitchers.
We see a similar trend when looking at vertical break, as almost all pitch types in our sample are thrown with more negative vertical break while ahead in the count relative to behind or even.
For fastballs, sinkers, changeups, and cutters, this would be referred to as less lift. Four-seam fastballs, on average, showed a drop in spin efficiency of -0.039% in ahead counts compared to behind, which could result in the slight drop in vertical break. It is also common for athletes, specifically those with lower average spin efficiency, to decrease their efficiency as fastball intent increases. Knowing that pitchers tend to add velocity ahead in the count with their fastballs while potentially lowering spin efficiency, we might be able to explain the loss of lift.
For curveballs and sliders, this would be referred to as more drop or depth. Sinkers were the only pitch type with more vertical break (more lift) when ahead in the count, which is perhaps counterintuitive given the purpose of a sinker.
Less surprisingly, however, sliders and cutters were the two pitch types with the biggest change in VB from count to count. For sliders, it is likely that a pitcher wants to increase depth and downward movement to induce a swing and miss, while the same may be true for cutters as well.
On average, the count didn’t seem to have as big of an effect on horizontal break as it did on velocity and vertical break. As seen above, the average deviation in horizontal break is significantly lower than in vertical break, as all values hover around 0. However, the horizontal break of sliders and cutters was most affected in ahead counts, while all other pitch types were essentially unaffected. It is possible given the abundance of curveballs and sliders thrown harder while ahead that there are pitchers who sacrifice movement in exchange for the increase in velocity.
In order to determine whether a change in velocity or movement is intentional, we need an understanding of the league-wide standard deviations for each pitch type. Below is a table showing the average pitch variation in movement, spin, and velocity across all counts.
The pitches and metrics with smaller deviations indicate that they don’t fluctuate as much as other pitch types. The lowest expected deviation we found was mostly with sinkers, as they showed the smallest deviations in speed, spin, and horizontal break. This means that across the league sinkers were the most consistent pitch type in terms of velocity and movement. The opposite is true for changeups and curveballs, as they were two of the types with the most variance.
The lower chart indicates our cutoffs for determining significant, or outlier, deviations per metric. These numbers were multiplied by a z score of 2.326, using an alpha level of 0.01. So, in order to determine the frequency of sliders that were significantly manipulated by a pitcher within a given count or game state, we simply flagged pitches that fell above or below the thresholds above.
For example, the deviation of significance for slider velocity was found to be 0.959mph, so we simply flagged the pitchers who threw their SLs .959mph above or below their own average as significantly changing the velocity of that pitch within a given count. The same methods were used for horizontal and vertical break.
With a quantitative blueprint for deeming pitch type movement variation as intentional, we can evaluate all pitch types across all counts. This generates insights into what pitches and metrics are manipulated the most/least in certain counts.
As mentioned previously, velocity was significantly higher in ahead counts compared to even and behind counts. Excluding the cutter, pitchers threw 33.6% of all pitches significantly harder while ahead relative to even or behind. Across all pitch types, 28% of pitches were significantly harder in ahead counts compared to behind, while 4% were significantly slower. Cumulatively, 32% of all pitch types were significantly different in terms of velocity when ahead versus behind. When we include all counts, 21% of all pitches were either significantly harder or slower relative to the specific count state.
At the league-wide level, sinker velocity was most influenced by the count, with 38% coming in significantly harder and 2% coming in significantly slower when ahead versus behind. The four-seamer, slider, curveball and changeup were all 30%-33% harder while ahead. At just 10% harder in ahead counts, cutter velocity was least affected by the count. Overall, in terms of  both significantly gaining and/or losing velocity in all counts, sinkers were the most manipulated (27%) and cutters were the least (10%).
There are a few theories as to why horizontal break would be intentionally changed depending on the count. With breaking balls, there is a velocity-sweep tradeoff which describes an increase in velocity as usually requiring a sacrifice in horizontal movement, and vice versa. In ahead counts, some pitchers may opt to throw their breaking balls harder with less sweep, and some may throw theirs slower with more sweep. It is also possible that a change in horizontal break is the indirect consequence of changing intent and velocity with the pitch, so the main focus is throwing the pitch harder, but the movement possibly decreases as a result. On the other hand, pitchers could take a tick or two off their breakers to increase movement.
When looking at ahead-behind comparisons amongst all pitches, there were similar results for significantly more HB (22%) and less HB (20%), for a total of 42% of pitches significantly manipulated by horizontal break in either direction. This balance potentially describes both strategies of increasing velocity (less sweep) and/or increasing movement (more sweep) in order to achieve a whiff. Gloveside breaking pitches (sliders, curveballs, cutters) seemed to favor more sweep in ahead counts. Pitches with armside movement (four-seam fastballs, changeups, sinkers) favored less horizontal break while ahead.
Again, sinkers lead the way with 49% of pitches showing significantly different horizontal break while ahead compared to behind. Four-seamers, cutters, sliders, and curveballs saw significance in the 40%-44% range for either gaining or losing HB in ahead counts. In all counts, 34% of all pitch types were significantly manipulated by horizontal break. Overall, in terms of both significantly gaining/losing horizontal break in all counts, sinkers were the most manipulated (40%) and both sliders and changeups were the least (30%).
Nearly across the board, pitches tended to have negative vertical break (less lift, more drop) while ahead in the count. For gloveside pitches, curveballs, cutters, and sliders favored more depth (negative VB) while ahead in the count. This supports the theory that while ahead, pitchers may add more downward movement in an attempt to induce a swing and miss. Fastballs and sinkers were roughly split, with the same percentage of more lift and less lift while ahead. Cutters saw a drastic favoring of more lift while ahead in the count at 30%, compared to the 10% of pitches that showed less lift. Overall, in terms of both significantly gaining and losing lift in all counts, sinkers were the most manipulated (41%) and changeups were the least (27%).
When we take into consideration significant deviations in all pitch types across velocity or movement, 59% of all pitches are thrown with a significantly different profile compared to their profiles in other counts. Specifically, 73% of ahead-count pitches have significant deviation in velocity, movement or both compared to behind counts. 52% of ahead count pitches were intentionally manipulated relative to even counts, while 53% of even count profiles were manipulated compared to behind counts.
Given the intricacies of pitching strategy and pitch movement, it is no surprise that there is meaningful pitch profile manipulation occurring on a pitch by pitch basis in the big leagues. In this piece we aimed to provide quantitative context for which pitch types are changed, how, by how much, and when.

The Impact of Seam-Shifted Wakes on Pitch Quality - Driveline Baseball,2021-03-11T00:34:47+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/the-impact-of-seam-shifted-wakes-on-pitch-quality/,"In the months since our introductory piece on the Seam-Shifted Wake effect, many different wings of the industry have taken a stab at proving its (SSW) existence and relevance from player to player across varying pitch types (Baseball Prospectus, Alan Nathan, Glenn Healey and Lequan Wang, Trip Somers). With strong evidence that SSW not only exists, but can also strongly influence performance, many solutions have been proposed to try and quantify its value.
While some analyses (including our own) have used Spin Direction (or Axis) Deviation to tackle performance-related Seam-Shifted Wake questions, this method does not explain the full relevance of SSW and other non-Magnus effects. For example, consider that:
Fortunately, in early 2021, Baseball Savant revealed their new Spin Direction Leaderboard, which allowed us access to directly measured Spin Efficiency (or Active Spin), Spin Rate, and Observed Spin Direction on a per player-season basis.
With the above parameters, one can reverse engineer how much a pitch should move based on spin and trajectory out of hand (similar to that of Rapsodo) and juxtapose it to how much it actually moved. By comparing the two, we can determine on a player pitch type basis who benefits from SSW (and other non-Magnus effects) using our proprietary pitcher “stuff” metric, Stuff+. Hopefully, this will be a step forward in defining the value behind non-Magnus effects, and determining which pitchers and pitch types stand to gain the most from Seam-Shifted Wakes.
Although Seam-Shifted Wakes are often credited as the sole source of non-Magnus effects on the baseball, there are other important factors that can influence pitch flight. Solely using deviation between Observed and Inferred Spin Direction can be misleading in its raw form, as there are often other wrinkles at play that can cause a discrepancy between the two.
Sometimes, a ball’s flight can be obstructed by forces out of a pitcher’s control, namely air conditions at ball release. Air density, wind, and other environmental factors at pitch release can cause irregular movement. While there are methods to make adjustments for these factors, it is a tall task to control for all of these at the exact moment a pitch is released, as we know that weather is oftentimes unpredictable. Coors Field in particular can suppress a pitch’s movement by ~25%. If we don’t attempt to control for environment, we can’t begin to attribute movement to other sorts of external forces, like SSW.
This may be an effect that many are unfamiliar with, and it is certainly a bit more perplexing if you don’t come from a traditional physics background. Many are taught that Gyro Spin doesn’t contribute to the movement of a pitch, but that isn’t entirely correct. Gyro Spin (or Rifle Spin) can indeed contribute to movement depending on the pitch’s trajectory, the amount of Gyro Spin it has, and which direction the Gyro Degree is pointed to.*
*In this piece, we classified non-Magnus as forces unrelated to the expected Magnus force due to spin out of hand. While Gyro to Transverse falls into this category, technically, it is a Magnus effect as the axis is shifting during ball flight.
To gain a better perspective on the magnitude of this effect on the baseball, we compared Gyro Spin out of hand to the difference between Trajectory Horizontal Break and Spin-Based Horizontal Break values from in-facility Rapsodo sessions. In this case, a change of -1 inch would be 1 inch of additional sweep that occurs during ball flight.
We can see that at most, a RHP can look to gain ~2 inches of gloveside movement in the extreme case of 2500 RPM of Gyro Spin. While an additional 2 inches is nothing to sniff at, this effect generally provides somewhat trivial gains, with the median SL/CT in our dataset adding .75 inches of gloveside movement.
We owe an awful lot to Barton Smith and his continued research on Seam-Shifted Wakes, as his work has spawned many insightful and impactful pieces of public research. The SSW Effect can be summarized by the following: when altering the seam orientation of the ball, you can break the symmetry of the ball’s wake, causing turbulence on one side of the baseball that creates force, and thus movement, that wouldn’t be expected when looking solely at Magnus.
Up until 2020, inferring non-Magnus effects would’ve been an impossible task at the Major League Level, as there were no in-game pitch-tracking technologies that directly measured spin characteristics at release, which are needed to surmise expected break. With the introduction of Hawk-Eye last season, an optical (meaning camera-based) tracking system that does measure these values, the wheels were set into motion.
With this newfound, directly-measured data in hand, we were able to measure expected movement, or Spin-Based Breaks (both horizontal and vertical), out of hand, by deriving average velocity and spin vectors for a player pitch type. From here, we removed drag and the effect of environmental conditions for both break sets so that we could isolate dragless movement from ball release.
When comparing this data with Trajectory Breaks, which describe the total movement of the pitch, we can attribute any difference between the two to either non-Magnus effects or Hawk-Eye error.
When looking at different systems, there are a multitude of concerns: where the sensor (in this case a camera) is positioned within a park, the calibration of the system, weather, misreads due to a model error, as well as potential tagging issues. These issues are commonplace, with both PITCHf/x and Trackman both struggling during initial rollout.
Public baseball analyst Lau Sze Yui (@903124S on Twitter) outlined some concerns regarding potential errors with Hawk-Eye in a thread (our very own Alex Caravan also dove in), detailing the differences in Observed and Inferred Spin Directions for different parks and pitch types. In this case, extreme outliers are somewhat worrisome, as they suggest broad differences in Observed and Inferred SDs, which signal a larger non-Magnus effect. If these differences are inflated, that throws a wrench into measuring the magnitude and direction of non-Magnus.
In our own attempts to correct Hawk-Eye’s Spin Directions using the popular Standard Candle Method, we didn’t find much to be concerned about. Especially considering the magnitude of Spin Direction values (0-360°), small discrepancies do little to make us question the validity of Hawk-Eye’s output.
At most, we found the largest amount of park error to be less than 2°. With 21 out of 30 parks coming in below 1° of error, this does not appear to be a league-wide issue.
With a better understanding of the factors above, and our Spin-Based and Trajectory Breaks in hand, we can start to get an idea of how prevalent non-Magnus effects like SSW are at the major-league level, as well as how they impact the quality of a pitcher’s arsenal.
On a macro-scale, each pitch type is impacted by non-Magnus effects in different ways, with Gyro Spin-heavy pitches like sliders and cutters likelier to be influenced by Gyro to Transverse, and pitches that move to the armside (sinkers and changeups) being more likely to present seam-effects. However, non-Magnus effects are not mutually exclusive, meaning that many can be present at once.
Given the league-wide trends above, some expected outcomes appear. Sinkers, which have been at the center of SSW discussion, are heavily impacted both vertically and horizontally. The average sinker gained more than 3 inches of run and nearly 4 inches of depth due to non-Magnus effects — that is a significant amount of movement. Changeups (and splitters) don’t see quite the same gain with regards to run, but still benefit from a considerable amount of additional drop (which is generally a positive trait for offspeed pitches).
On the flip side, cutters also showed substantial changes, generating around 3 extra inches of gloveside movement and 2 additional inches of drop. Cutters typically have the heaviest gyro components, so they have the potential to be influenced by the Gyro to Transverse effect. Fourseamers, especially those with lower Spin Efficiencies (and thus more Gyro Spin), also generate a fair amount of “cut” but don’t seem to be as prone to losing ride as other pitch types.
Somewhat surprisingly, sliders and curveballs don’t seem to have any noticeable, large, league-wide effects. While at the extremes, there are certainly pitchers that have significant amounts of movement added/subtracted to their breaking balls due to non-Magnus effects, these pitches appear to be less susceptible to non-Magnus effects on average.
Perhaps these effects are clearer when examining a specific pitcher’s arsenal. Below, we can see that recent Astros’ signee Jake Odorizzi has an arsenal that is heavily impacted by non-Magnus effects, with the circle points representing Spin Breaks (expected) and the diamonds representing Trajectory Breaks (actual movement).
Odorizzi has a deep and varied arsenal, and each pitch was affected by SSW (and company) in a different way. For example, his fourseamer lost around 2 inches of rise, which significantly lowered the quality of the offering according to our Stuff+ metric (more on this below), while his changeup (which is more accurately classified as a splitter) benefitted from considerably more drop than what was expected.
In contrast, Max Scherzer’s arsenal appears to be predominantly Magnus-heavy, with most of his pitches impacted only marginally by seam-effects.
Scherzer’s highest non-Magnus gain in Stuff+ comes from his changeup, with the pitch dropping an additional 4 inches relative to expectation. Scherzer also sees a non-Magnus bump in Stuff+ on his cutter, which follows a similar trend to the league, adding a fair amount of gloveside movement.
As noted when mentioning the pitfalls of using Spin Direction as a proxy for movement, an inch of Horizontal Break is not always equivalent in value to an inch of Vertical Break, and vice versa. The quality of a pitch is multi-faceted, and the presence of non-Magnus break doesn’t always impact a pitcher’s “stuff” as we think it would. Internally, we use Stuff+ to assess pitch quality, taking into account the physical characteristics of a pitch, controlling for count, batter talent, location, and other external factors. Stuff+, like other “+” metrics, has a league average of 100. So, for a FB with a Stuff+ of 105, we can say that it is 5% better than league average.
Typically, Stuff+ is based upon Trajectory Breaks, as those are the break values that we have access to through MLB’s public data streams. These also represent the actual movement of the pitch. However, when comparing these traditional Stuff+ values to Stuff+ based on Spin Breaks (how we expect the pitch to move), we are able to determine how much value a player gains from harnessing (inadvertently or not) forces other than the Magnus effect.
For fastballs, the effects of SSW can cause dramatic shifts in pitch quality. At the top end, sinkers that generate an extreme amount of, well, sink due to shifted-wakes find themselves in a much better position than they would be if seam-effects weren’t present. It’s not an exaggeration to say that sinkers must have the presence of seam-effects, or else they will likely fall well below the threshold of an effective major-league offering (barring extremes in regards to velocity or command of the pitch).
On the opposite end, we see some aces that get docked pretty heavily, and there’s logic behind this. Out of hand, the sinkers of Darvish, Woodruff, and Burnes have a movement profile more similar to their fourseamer, featuring more ride and less run. During flight, due to seam-effects, these pitches are all brought into a movement profile that we refer to as the “dead zone”, where Vertical and Horizontal Break are almost equal and outcomes are more favorable to a batter.
Because Stuff+ is very high on heaters that have excess Vertical Break, but lower on dead zone sinkers, this suggests that SSW actually pushes these pitches into a profile that isn’t as effective.
As noted before, cutters usually have heavy gyro components, so they have more potential to be influenced by the Gyro to Transverse effect alongside any potential seam-effects. Cutters also have Observed Spin Directions very similar to a fastball (for example, Burnes’ cutter is at 192° & his fourseamer is at 190°), so when they end up generating more gloveside movement than expected, it leads to big gains in Stuff+.
Sliders are an interesting case, as we are aware that most don’t have much to add from non-Magnus forces. But, for some, the pitch appears to be more “slurvy” out of hand, only to end up with a monster, sweep-heavy profile (Yohan Ramirez, Jake Diekman, Mike Clevinger, Justin Topa).
But, because it’s likely that these pitches already rate out well without any unexpected movement, in most cases there aren’t massive gains to be had. There are some sliders, though, that seemingly “back-up” on the way to the plate, and lose HBreak in the process (Seth Romero, Jack Flaherty), which results in a pitch with a worse profile.
Offspeed pitches are often the trickiest to properly grade out, as much of their success is determined by how well they play with a pitcher’s mix of fastballs (Harry Pavlidis covered this idea in a series at BP). Additionally, we group splitters and changeups together, and these pitches have varying components that could be influenced by outside forces in a variety of ways.
Traditional changeups, like sinkers, are more susceptible to seam-effects due to seam orientation at release. However, changeup and splitter grips are a dime a dozen, and with so many varying grips, it’s hard to pinpoint which lead to the most extreme movement changes due to non-Magnus.
Generally, though, additional drop for a changeup is a valuable trait, as it helps increase separation between the offering and a pitcher’s FB. Those who are dinged the most when looking at Stuff+ tend to add lift to their offspeed, limiting the effectiveness of the pitch.
If you’re curious about Spin and Trajectory Breaks and have a Rapsodo unit with CSV access, you’re in luck. Given that Rapsodo is optical-based, like Hawk-Eye, it has the ability to pick up key parameters out of hand that help calculate both Spin-Based and Trajectory-Based Breaks.  When you compare the two metrics against one another, you can start to measure the magnitude of non-Magnus effects both vertically and laterally.
If subscribed to Rapsodo’s Advanced or Advisor Cloud tiers, you have access to CSV files that include both break sets. However, you’ll need to be mindful of measurement error, placement of the unit, calibration, and other potential issues before diving in. As such, it’s important to view this solution as just a rough estimate of non-Magnus movement, rather than ground truth.
While it is clear that Seam-Shifted Wakes are not the only non-Magnus force to impact ball flight, they appear to be accountable for the lion’s share of non-Magnus movement. At the extremes, SSW can contribute ~9 inches of lateral and/or vertical movement to a pitch, changing the profile and subsequent outcomes achieved by a pitch type altogether.
Most pitch types at the MLB level get a sizable boost in quality due to these effects, but like most hard and fast rules, there are some exceptions. For example, around 42% of pitches in our 2020 MLB sample had a lower Stuff+ relative to their Spin-Based estimate, indicating that the value in obtaining a SSW effect should be considered in relation to a pitch type’s initial spin-profile rather than without context.
Not mentioned in this piece is the component to SSW that is perhaps the most interesting — late break. Unfortunately, because a pitch’s trajectory is still reported via Statcast using the 9 parameter fit, we still have work left to do to uncover when non-Magnus forces take place during ball flight.
Theoretically, being able to parse out “late break” would be a boon for understanding pitch quality, but until that data is available to the public at the pitch-level, we will have to continue to engineer workarounds at the per-season level like the ones provided in this piece.
Given that we’re still scratching the surface with SSW, we’ve provided a free spreadsheet (normalized so that all values are from the RHP perspective) that contains both Hawk-Eye’s Trajectory Breaks and derived Spin-Based Breaks. With our understanding on non-Magnus effects changing week-by-week, we hope that this can be a resource to the community as we continue to dissect and evaluate the true movement characteristics of a pitch.

Effects of Weighted Balls on Pitching Mechanics: A Full Signal Analysis -,2021-03-05T01:08:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/effects-of-weighted-balls-on-pitching-mechanics-a-full-signal-analysis/,"Dr. Glenn Fleisig and his research group at ASMI published a study—as we have at Driveline—investigating the effects of weighted balls on pitching mechanics using optical motion capture (the gold-standard in biomechanics measurement).
The ASMI and Driveline studies both investigated how pitchers’ mechanics changed as they threw differently weighted balls, and both studies found similar changes. Both studies found that peak rotational speeds decreased, torso forward tilt increased, and pitch velocity decreased as ball weight increased from 3 ounces to 7 ounces, while the ASMI study produced a few additional results (although they didn’t adjust for multiple comparisons). One significant problem with these studies, however, is that they compared mechanics by measuring a few handfuls of single values for each throw, rather than comparing measurements throughout the whole throw.
These singular values to describe the biomechanics of a throw are calculated by taking various measurements at standard points in time. For example, measuring pelvis position at the time when the pitcher’s front foot strikes the ground (foot plant, FP) or when the ball is released from the hand (ball release, BR). We can also take measurements when they reach their global maximums or minimums, such as maximum elbow flexion, throughout the throw.  However, there is much more to the pitching delivery than a few instantaneous positions, so being able to compare metrics for the entire duration of the throw is invaluable. To address this limitation, we used statistical parametric mapping to compare the entire throw using the same dataset as our pre-printed study. Here is an example with forward trunk tilt: Would you rather compare trunk tilt throughout two whole throws like the plot here on the left, or compare the degree of trunk tilt in these throws at one time point, as seen in the plot on the right?
We discuss this limitation in more detail in our first full signal analysis post with an example of our solution, but, in summary, full signal analysis using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) allows us to compare entire throws from start to finish, rather than at only a handful of time points. We should also mention that full signal analysis has its own limitations due to a large number of comparisons and because the signals need to be time normalized, but these are overshadowed by the benefits of full signal analysis.
Here’s a quick summary of the results of the study using full signal analysis:
All things considered, the one major effect of 3 – 7 oz weighted baseballs is the speed at which athletes deploy their arms. Throwing these balls resulted in little to no ‘practically significant’ differences in pitching mechanics. This supports using weighted balls to possibly train more efficiently, improve athlete comfort, and train for power and speed.
And now for the specifics.
For this investigation we use the same statistics package as in the aforementioned analysis (statistical parametric mapping) to compare mechanics from the start of the throw to the finish. For example, one of the metrics we investigated was elbow flexion/extension velocity. The effect of ball weight on elbow flexion was evaluated for the whole throw using an ANOVA statistical test, and since the test showed that ball weight affected elbow flexion, we compared elbow flexion between pitches with different weights (3 oz vs. 4 oz, 4 oz vs. 6 oz, etc.).
Statistical difference between conditions is shown by the red line on the right plot; when it exceeds the threshold of significance (black horizontal dashed line on the right hand side), we can say with confidence that the two conditions are statistically different. For example, the red line exceeds the horizontal dashed line near the end of the plot below, telling us that ball weight significantly affected this metric near the end of the throw, since we know that the ball is released at frame 300 on the x-axis.
This process is basically repeated for all chosen metrics to see not only what aspects of the throw are different when throwing different ball weights but when in the throw they are different.
For the metrics that are shown to be significantly affected by ball weight, we compare each ball weight to see which are actually different. You can see the results of this type of comparison below, which compares throws with the 3 oz weighted baseball to throws with the 7 oz weighted baseball.
Similar to our investigation using point of interest data (e.g. comparing pelvis angle at front foot plant between 3 oz and 4 oz throws), we grouped biomechanical metrics into categories to describe overall types of movements in the throw. These categories were arm position measurements such as elbow flexion, mid-section position measurements such as pelvis rotation angle, lead knee flexion, the only lower body measurement we took, kinematic velocity measurements such as torso rotation velocity, and kinetics such as elbow valgus torque. The metrics that were significantly affected by ball weight within subjects (which mostly coincided with our point of interest analysis) included:
This means that within each subject (each participant in the study compared to himself), the above metrics had at least one point in time throughout the throw which differed when throwing different ball weights.
Now let’s look further at each of those kinematic and kinetic changes.
Elbow flexion and shoulder rotation were both significantly affected by ball weight in the arm kinematics category. The two other metrics tested in the arm kinematics category, shoulder horizontal abduction and shoulder abduction, did not show a significant effect from weighted balls.
We will start with elbow flexion:
The red, vertical lines in the plots above represent the moment of foot plant. You can see that the black line on the right plot reaches statistical significance (by crossing the horizontal dashed line) just a bit after foot plant meaning that the two conditions become different at this point in the throw. If you look at the same spot on the left graph, you can see that the difference is around the peak of the elbow flexion signal with the 3 oz line being higher than the 6 oz line, meaning 3 oz throws resulted in a significantly higher peak elbow flexion on average. Higher peak elbow flexion corresponds to the arm being more bent at the elbow—their hand being closer to their body. This is what we found in our point of interest analysis as well.
Now for shoulder rotation:
This 4 oz vs. 7 oz comparison shows how shoulder rotation is affected by weighted balls, but it’s not where you might think. Maximum shoulder external rotation is not affected by weighted baseballs (at least 3 oz – 7oz) in a max intent pitch, but lighter balls have more internal rotation at the end of the throw, right before ball release.
This makes sense for a few reasons. First, shoulder internal rotation velocity is faster with light balls so it makes sense that light balls would have more internal rotation later in the throw. Second, the lighter ball weights may require a lower trajectory out of the hand, which could affect shoulder positioning at ball release. Last but not least, the position of the torso at ball release is slightly different, which will affect shoulder rotation since shoulder angles are calculated as the position of the humerus (upper arm) with respect to the position of the torso. More below.
To test mid-section mechanics, we included comparisons of pelvis and trunk (torso) forward and lateral tilt, pelvis and torso rotation, and hip shoulder separation. Only trunk forward tilt was significantly affected by weighted balls, as we see here.
At the end of the throw, athletes exhibited significantly more forward trunk tilt (chest more parallel with the ground) with heavier balls just before ball release, which we also found in our point of interest analysis. This is interesting in its own right because it suggests that athletes more actively use their mid-sections to throw heavier balls, but it’s also interesting because it ties in to shoulder rotation. Since shoulder angles are calculated by comparing the position of the humerus (upper arm) relative to the torso (the chest), if the torso is tilted further forward when throwing heavier balls but the arm is at a similar position at ball release, shoulder external rotation is going to be greater.
Shoulder internal rotation velocity and elbow extension velocity were both affected by weighted balls, but pelvis and trunk rotational velocity and front knee extension velocity were unaffected.
Light balls measured in terms of both elbow extension velocity and shoulder internal rotation velocity elicited higher peaks, meaning athletes extended their elbow faster and internally rotated their shoulder faster when throwing lighter balls. This is somewhat intuitive and also what we found with our point of interest analysis.
The only two kinetics tested in this analysis were the elbow varus moment (can be thought of as the same thing as valgus torque) and shoulder internal rotation moment (the torque involved in the internal rotation movement of the shoulder). In our point of interest analysis, we did not find a significant difference in peak values of either of these metrics, but we wanted to look at more than just the peak values in this case. The results are as follows:
We found (again) that peak values in both metrics of stress/kinetics/torques (whichever you prefer to call it) were not affected by weighted balls on average. We did find a significant difference between light and heavy balls at foot plant, but this difference is not practically important because it happens when the torques are right around zero. You can see that the 3 oz throws in both elbow varus moment and shoulder internal rotation moment produce significantly lower values than the 6 oz at foot plant, but it is a difference of 7.16 Nm for 3 oz and 13.04 Nm for 6 oz.
Since both of these values are so low compared to their respective peaks (about 147 Nm for both), the effect we see here of weighted ball on shoulder and elbow torques is not an implication for injury; rather, this effect has more implications on timing analysis, i.e. suggesting that athletes start to resist external rotation a short time earlier with heavy balls than with light balls.
After analyzing commonly used discrete points of interest throughout the throw, incorporating previously published literature, and also doing full signal kinematic analysis on our current dataset, there is one thing we have learned about 3 – 7 oz leather weighted baseballs: they don’t change pitching mechanics hardly at all. Athletes move their arms faster with lighter balls and slower with heavier balls, but as far as positioning and movement effects, they are pretty minimal.
Sure, when you add a movement constraint into the mix like we do here at Driveline, the combination of a weighted implement and the constraint may affect how an athlete moves. However, that is a question for another day. What we now know about conservatively weighted overload and underload baseballs is that they affect how fast an athlete’s arm can move, they affect some end ranges of motion of arm and mid-section kinematics (not the ones you’d think), and they have little to no impact on elbow and shoulder kinematics.
Weighted baseballs do have an effect on throwing kinematics; however, it’s important to note that the magnitude of this effect is very small and likely practically insignificant. For example, as we saw with the point of interest analysis, the greatest mean difference in elbow flexion between any two ball weights was a 2 degree difference between 4 oz and 6 oz throws. The typical range of motion of elbow flexion/extension was around 90 degrees. This means that the biggest effect between different ball weights was about a 2% difference. Doesn’t seem practically significant, does it?
Since 3 – 7 oz weighted baseballs don’t change mechanics very much, let’s talk about how they can be valuable. There are a few things I think should be considered: power/speed adaptation; throwing fitness and throwing volume; training efficiency; and athlete comfort.
Many training programs (outside of baseball as well) use underload and overspeed training. The theory is that using underload implements or assisting movements so they can be performed faster would require the body to recruit different motor units and learn to use faster control patterns. If this is the case, then using 3 and 4 oz weighted baseballs would be a low-risk addition to a training program, since we saw that the athletes’ arms moved faster when throwing a lighter ball with relatively no adverse effects on throwing mechanics or stress on the body/arm.
Building throwing fitness and increasing volume in a training program can be done by varying throw frequency, throw intensity, total number of throws, and changing the load. Small increases in ball weight can add more load to a throwing exercise without regressing mechanics, so throwing these leather weighted baseballs can be a good approach to changing total workload (for lack of a more encompassing term) without further increasing total number of throws.
Similarly, since mechanics don’t change with a 7 oz baseball (2 oz overload), maybe it is possible to get similar training effects with fewer throws by using the heavier ball. When I head into the weight room and set up the bench press for a few sets, I can reach max exertion with fewer reps if I use a heavier load. So, if I have less time to do a workout or a warm-up, maybe I would load up the bar a bit more than my typical load if I knew it wasn’t going to adversely affect my movement.
A movement like a throw in which every throw places the arm under a high degree of stress is more complex than the bench press, which supports the use of a light overload even further. If I can place my arm under less high stress repetitions and get a more efficient training effect by using a light overload baseball, that sounds like a good idea.
A training study (or multiple training studies) would be required to be sure of these effects, but knowing that mechanics do not change significantly when throwing 3 – 7 oz weighted baseballs makes this a less risky idea to pursue.
If an athlete really enjoys using overload or underload baseballs to enhance how their body and arm feel for competition or training, we can now say with confidence that their mechanics shouldn’t change as a result (at least not acutely, intra-session). Knowing this, if an athlete enjoys using these different ball weights, a coach or trainer should be comfortable with their use.
We have not observed any significant adverse effects of using 3 – 7 oz leather weighted baseballs for throwing. This is based on two peer-reviewed, controlled studies of pitching mechanics.
If you, an athlete in your training program or team, a teammate, or anybody else is comfortable using leather weighted baseballs for pitching, there is no reason not to (if they’re used responsibly). With proper warm up (i.e. don’t throw a 7 oz with max intent right when you arrive at the field), proper on-ramping (start with conservative volume and increase from there), and proper monitoring (if the overload/underload throws seem to be associated with unusual soreness or pain, adjust volume/intensity appropriately), there is no compelling reason not to incorporate these implements.

Weighted Ball Training: Recreating and Validating 3-7oz Ball Research,2021-03-04T02:32:48+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/03/weighted-ball-training-recreating-and-validating-3-7oz-ball-research/,"Weighted ball training has grown in popularity in recent years, but although there have been numerous papers on the effectiveness of weighted balls, there is still some debate as to how exactly they work to improve velocity.As we’ve said previously, we didn’t think weighted balls worked until we tried them. Of course, there are a number of variables to account for in a player’s training, and as for weighted balls themselves, research has been heavy on programming investigations and light on specific biomechanical changes.
Soviet Sports Science’s research on over/underweight implements hypothesized that changing weights worked on the ‘speed-strength’ spectrum, with some suggesting that athletes should only adjust the weights within 20% overload or underload of the competition weight.
The closest we’re going to get to figuring out ‘how weighted balls work’ is going to be by looking at the acute biomechanical changes and pairing that with studies on specific programming.
As training becomes increasingly holistic, it’s important to note how difficult it is to identify what aspects of training may have caused a given result. Weighted balls, Plyo Ball ®, cues, drills, mobility work, strength work and programming are all factors in a player’s development, good or bad. After all, studies that look at specific programming with weighted balls are studies of both the types of weighted balls used and the programming: sets, reps, and intensity of the throws. Making their results only true to that specific programming and not relevant to other studies with other sets, reps, and intensities.ASMI looked at 4-7 oz balls in pulldowns and off the mound and found that the heavier balls (6 & 7 oz balls) produced less torque than a standard baseball. We’ve talked about the results of that study many times previously, but since the pitchers in that study didn’t throw 3 oz baseballs, we wanted to recreate the study with 3 to 7 oz baseballs thrown only off a mound.
Going into the study, our hypothesis was that we’d find similar results to ASMI.
“…we hypothesized that varying the pitched ball weight between three, four, five, six, and seven ounces would significantly affect pitched ball velocity, upper body kinematics, lower body kinematics, kinematic velocities, and throwing arm joint kinetics during a maximum intent throwing workout.”
We had 26 athletes throw in the study. They were acclimated to weighted ball training, so it is possible that results would be different in athletes who are new to training. We also had athletes throw the ball weights in the progression that we programmed for mound work or pulldown days: 5 oz, 6 oz, 7 oz, 5 oz, 4 oz, 3 oz.
Because we had them throw weighted balls in a specific progression and not random, we consider the results of our study to be specific to this sequence of weighted balls and not all weighted ball throwing. Lastly, in another difference from ASMI our throws only took place on the mound, no running throws.
Unsurprisingly, we found fairly similar results to ASMI, with only a few differences. Peak rotational speeds decreased, torso forward tilt increased, and pitch velocity decreased as ball weight increased from 3 ounces to 7 ounces.There are two important things to note. First, below are the discrete metrics that we tested; think snapshots in specific moments of time. We’ll look at the full signal analysis in a separate blog. Second, the threshold we used for significance was strict to account for the number of comparisons that we made. Below are what we found significant, along with a few key metrics we didn’t find significant:
So, pitchers are more anteriorly tilted at ball release, have lower peak elbow flexion, have a slower pelvis, and slower arm with heavy balls and vice versa. They also throw slower with heavy balls. There was no significant effect on the elbow or shoulder kinetics we tested.These were the relationships where we found significant differences. We’ll take deeper dives into what we think they mean below.
As a quick reminder, here are some definitions:Kinematics: Motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause it
Example: Arm speed or other rotational velocities
Kinetics: The study of forces acting on a mechanism
Example: The torque on the elbow or shoulder
Heavier balls led to lower maximum elbow flexion between the 3 & 6 oz ball, 4 & 6 oz ball and 4 & 7 oz ball. As we said previously the size of these differences was very small: 2 degrees.
We found no significant difference in maximum external rotation. Although it has been hypothesised that throwing heavier balls increases external rotation when throwing, we found no evidence of this when analyzing the group as a whole with 6 & 7 oz balls.
Heavier balls led to more forward trunk tilt at ball release, with the biggest difference being 2 degrees between 3 and 7 oz balls, though we saw a significant difference between the 3 & 4 oz baseballs and all other conditions. That said, it’s important to repeat that the size of these changes was also very small, with the biggest difference being 2 degrees.
Heavier balls led to lower peak pelvis angular velo. The most significant difference was the ~30 deg/second difference between the 3 and 7 oz balls, while there were also significant differences between the 3 & 6 oz and 4 & 7 oz balls. The pelvis rotated faster in the underload condition.
Similar to previous findings by ASMI, these results suggest that changing the ball weight can change kinematics outside the arm.
Underload balls seem to result in a slightly faster pelvis and slightly forward trunk at ball release. It’s important to note that even though these differences were found, they are likely small enough to not have a significant effect on training decisions. More research looking at targeted throwing of underload balls to change those conditions would be needed.
A somewhat interesting finding was significant differences between all ball velocities, with velocities decreasing as ball weight increased. However, not every ball weight resulted in significant differences in internal rotation or elbow extension.For internal rotation, the 7 oz produced significantly lower arm speed than the 3, 4 and 5 oz balls. The 3 oz had significantly higher arm speed than the 6 oz and 5 oz. For elbow extension, the 3 oz was significantly different than the 6 and 7 oz balls.These results do differ from ASMI’s findings, which found significant differences between all ball weights, and differences between 4-7 oz balls in shoulder internal rotation and elbow extension.One reason this may have occurred is that ASMI had players throw weighted balls in a random order, where our athletes threw in a progression. This means that fatigue could have been a factor when throwing the underload balls in our study with the underload balls being thrown last.It’s also possible that single point analysis of peak arm speeds is incomplete, and that there would be differences in full signal analysis or small differences in timing between the peaks.
Another surprising difference between our findings and ASMI was that we didn’t see a significant difference in torque between ball weights. This was a key finding of ASMI’s paper that we discussed previously, with torques decreasing as the ball weight increased.Our theories for why we had these differences come down to the previously mentioned difference in sequencing of the ball weights thrown and fatigue, though there is the possibility that there may be a training effect depending on how experienced someone is in throwing weighted balls.
Overall, these results support the thesis that throwing weighted balls from 3 to 7 ounces results in few significant differences in pitching mechanics. The significant differences we did find are very small in size. Supporting the thesis that athletes may throw 3 to 7 oz balls and stay relatively ‘within’ their mechanics.If we look at our findings and specific differences between the competition weight of 5 oz and the 3, 4, 6, and 7 oz baseballs, we only found three: a difference in elbow extension between the 3 and the 5 oz, and difference in forward trunk tilt between the 3 & 5 oz and 4 & 5 oz.Put another way, when looking at 4, 5, and 6 oz baseballs, we found one significant difference between the 4 & 6 oz baseball in elbow flexion (of less than 2 degrees) and differences in forward trunk tilt between the 4 & 6 and 4 & 5 oz. This supports the previously mentioned thesis that training within 20% of competition weight can train an athlete on the speed-strength spectrum while staying within their own mechanics.
More changes were seen between the different weighted balls and not between the competition weight and weighted balls.These findings and ASMI’s comments that the effects they found were relatively small fully support the thesis that pitchers can train with implements within 20% of competition weight and see nearly no change in their mechanics. Further, changes outside of that 20% threshold still see relatively small differences. For reference 4 & 6 oz balls are 20% lower and higher than a 5 oz competition weight. 3 & 7 oz balls are 40% from competition weight.We can then think of training at high intent with weighted balls as a speed/strength tool that is relatively agnostic to changes in pitching mechanics. So, we can separate work to make specific changes in mechanics from work with Plyo Ball ®, constraint drills and cues. Plyo Ball ® are heavier and the drills we use them in are intended to make mechanical changes. But that can be paired with more specific velocity work with weighted balls (3-7 oz) that may have a complementary effect on velocity while having a much smaller effect on pitching mechanics.Of course, these statements are relative to each player’s starting point and the specific programming that is assigned to them. We also have some unanswered questions regarding changes in arm speed and its relationship to changes in velocity. This goes to show that there are still plenty of biomechanics-related questions that remain unanswered, which we hope to address in the following years.
Good article. Are there any weighted ball studies that go beyond the 7oz ball (some weighted ball sets go as high as 12oz)? Personally, I have gone up to 9oz with my players and have seen increases in velocity, but these are purely anecdotal. Thanks

Bat speed versus throwing velocity: A preliminary investigation,2021-02-13T00:06:35+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2021/02/bat-speed-versus-throwing-velocity-a-preliminary-investigation/,"If you can swing a bat at a high velocity, can you throw a ball at a high velocity?  Is it really as they say, “rotation is rotation”?  Could there be a relationship between bat speed and throwing velocity? This past Fall, we sought an answer to this exact question.
The primary purpose of this investigation was to find the relationship between peak bat speed and high intent throwing velocity.  If a strong relationship was found, this could potentially demonstrate that elite throwers are elite rotators in the general sense.  Furthermore, a strong relationship may warrant further investigation through the implementation of a bat speed training protocol.
For this preliminary investigation, we expected to see a strong and direct relationship between average bat speed and throwing velocity off the mound.
69 total subjects (20 youth, 7 high school, 34 college, and 8 professional athletes) had their peak and average bat speed measured using a Blast sensor off of a stationary tee.  After a thorough warm up, all HS level players and up made 10 high effort swings with a ‘-3’ bat (33in, 30oz), while youth athletes made 10 high effort swings with their personal bat ranging between ‘-7’ and ‘-10’.  These Blast measurements were then compared to their throwing velocity (the average of three max-effort pitches) off a mound in our motion capture lab.  It should be noted that each athlete had their bat speed tested 48 hours before or after their motion capture assessment.   Furthermore, youth athletes in this group ranged between 11 and 14 years of age.
When looking at the results as a whole, including all samples, we can see a pretty strong relationship between average bat speed and throwing velocity off the mound.  However, given that this dataset includes athletes of all skill levels, this should not come as a surprise.  The older and more physically mature athletes will naturally throw and swing harder than youth athletes.
So, case closed, right?  The harder you can swing a bat, the harder you can throw a baseball.  Well, not so fast.  Based on our dataset, we can separate athletes into three throwing velocity buckets (<80mph, 80 – 86.9, and >87).  When we bucket athletes based on their throwing velocity, a different picture begins to take shape.
Needless to say, we were fairly surprised with our results.  The results of this investigation begin to highlight there may be a positive relationship between average bat speed and average throwing velocity, albeit a positive relationship up to a certain skill level.  The slower throwing athlete group (< 80mph) displayed a significant relationship between average bat speed and throwing velocity with a r value of .748.  From this information, it is reasonable to assume that with lesser skilled athletes an increase in average bat speed may be predictive of an increase in throwing velocity.
This strong relationship begins to wane as skill level increases, however.  Results from this investigation showed weak to no correlations for the two harder throwing athlete groups (80-86.9mph and >87mph) displaying a r value of .046 and 0.01, respectively.  From this information, it is reasonable to assume that with higher-skilled athletes an increase in average bat speed may not be predictive of an increase in average throwing velocity, or vice versa.  One potential reason for this may be that higher average throwing velocities generally require more precise sequencing, ‘sound’ mechanics, high strength levels, and high kinematic velocities via lead leg extension, pelvis rotation, torso rotation, elbow extension, and shoulder internal rotation as compared to hitting and generating bat speed.
Based upon the results of this investigation, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between average bat speed and average throwing velocity for higher-skilled athletes.  That being said, I think the results of this investigation do support the idea and importance of “building skills that scale” —a phrase often stated by our Director of Youth Training, Deven Morgan.  This phrase serves as the driving force and philosophy behind our Youth Academy teams.  Designing a fun, yet competitive training environment that improves raw qualities or skills (ie. bat speed) that translate to many aspects of the game of baseball, and other sports as well.

The definition of potentiation from Merriam Webster is, “to make effective or active or more effective or more active; to augment the activity of (something, such as a drug) synergistically.” Post-activation potentiation is the idea of leading one exercise with another that will theoretically improve the performance or outcome of the trailing exercise.
Concurrent Activation Potentiation (CAP) is the idea of activating some contraction or muscle activation while the activity you want to optimize is being performed. One practical example of this used is jaw clenching or jaw opening while an activity is being performed, such as lifting weights.
Mace et al. at Florida Southern College looked into the effects of CAP on bat speed of 13 NCAA softball players by having them test their bat speed off of a tee in two different conditions: while clenching their jaws and one while they relaxed their jaw muscles.
The order was counterbalanced so that the effects that might be observed from the order of the two conditions were minimized. Using a simple paired t-test, the authors found that the group mean bat speed was significantly higher in the jaw-clenched condition than the jaw-relaxed condition (62.7, 65.8 mph). 10 of the 13 participants observed an increase in mean bat speed from the relaxed condition to the clenched condition.
This study is awesome because the results are clear cut and the readers can easily apply the results. However, the idea of a clenched jaw improving athletic performance and strength/speed output is not something I imagine is surprising to many.
Many performers will make a “game face” or grunt, clench their jaw, contract other face muscles, clench fists even in a lower-body activity, etc. Maybe this factors into why some people have seen performance increases from wearing a mouthpiece while performing—because it allows them to clench harder more comfortably. Regardless of the cause, this idea is very cool and deserves to be considered for those interested in optimizing athletic performance.
Despite the increasing number of Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) constructions in baseball, the performance effects of this reconstruction procedure, if any, are not fully understood. Some say that pitchers come back from rehabilitation throwing harder since they have a new ligament, or they come back with worse command. McKnight et al. in Los Angeles used MLB in-game data paired with injury data of MLB pitchers to investigate performance differences before and after UCL surgery.
This study included 39 pitchers who underwent UCL reconstruction surgery in 2011 or 2012. Fastball velocity, baseball accuracy, and curveball movement were recorded and compared between the one year pre-operative and three years post-operative. Fastball velocity and curveball movement are pretty straightforward measurements, but fastball accuracy is a tough metric to measure with confidence. This study used COMMANDf/x, which incorporates pitch characteristics and the location of the catcher’s glove with the pitch is released.
Out of the three measures included in this study, the only one that was significantly different between pre-op and post-op was fastball accuracy. There was just over a 9% accuracy degradation one year and three years after UCL reconstruction for fastball accuracy in this sample, both of which were statistically significant difference. However, fastball accuracy two years after UCL reconstruction was not significantly different—but was about 4% worse than pre-op on average. Fastball velocity and curveball movement did not exhibit significant differences before and after UCL reconstruction, despite the confounding factor of age.
There could be something to the idea that command gets worse after UCL reconstruction. With different tissues in the arm, movement, stability, and strength may be affected—especially since accuracy was worse on average in all three years post-op.
However, the validity of the COMMANDf/x measurement needs to be considered since there are a lot of confounding factors. Measurement variability aside (error in measurement), we cannot be sure that using the position of the catchers’ gloves when the pitch is released as a measure of the pitch target is a valid measurement. There is a lot of movement in the position and orientation of catchers’ gloves before receiving a pitch. If the variability in the pre-receipt glove movement of the catcher is not random, it will show up in statistical tests, confounding the command measurement.
It’s not to say that these results are invalid—the measurement quality of fastball accuracy just needs to be considered when interpreting these results. I think these results warrant a more controlled look at accuracy pre- and post-UCL reconstruction. A study like this would be tough to execute because it would require a prospective design that would involve measuring the accuracy in a controlled setting of many pitchers since the researchers would not know who will need UCL reconstruction in the future. This is the main reason injury research is so difficult.
Aside from command, the null results (no difference) of fastball velocity and curveball movement are both interesting in their own right. One thing that should be noted is that comparing performance after surgery to the year before surgery could have limitations. Pitchers may not be achieving peak performance the year before surgery if they are technically injured.
A closer-to-perfect comparison, in my opinion, would be to compare each pitcher’s post-surgery performance to a measure of their peak performance in their career. However, I still think these results show how successful this operation has been for keeping athletes in the game longer since they can consistently return to their pre-UCL reconstruction performance.
Tanaka et al. in Japan collected an impressively large dataset to test for biomechanical parameters that are associated with peak elbow load. 107 high school pitchers with an average age of 16.3 years were included.
This group used multiple linear regression to test the association of 26 different parameters with peak elbow varus torque. The authors ended up with a model that included five different parameters that explained 38% of the elbow torque variance. Those five parameters are:
Interestingly, the relationships between these measurements and velocity in the study, on average, were weak. The authors explicitly reported on this part of the analysis. This is interesting because, at first impression, the role of velocity and performance in the increase of elbow load was something I assumed would account for most of these relationships. In other words, often we find that indicators of performance are decent indicators of torque since it takes more torque to accelerate and move faster. However, the authors reported on these relationships, so based on their analysis, that doesn’t seem to be the driver of this load.
One of the problems with these types of analyses, which is something we have to be careful about at Driveline as well with our biomechanical data, is that they are descriptive and cross-sectional. In other words, they only describe the dataset at one point in time. This study’s results are very interesting, and I think studies like these warrant more controlled experiments in which the subjects try to manipulate their kinematics with experimenters observing the effects on load measures. Alternatively, a follow-up could include a longitudinal dataset as well: measuring pitcher’s kinematics at two or more points in time and observing the association between the changes in these measurements and elbow load.
The last thing to note is that elbow load is not entirely understood, and we still cannot predict injury with kinetic measures like peak elbow varus torque. Right now, it is merely our best proxy for the workload an athlete is undergoing. Either way, the results of this study are thought-provoking and something to consider for biomechanists to investigate further. We are not in a position to start making sound applications of these results in the applied settings, however. More testing is required.

"CAUGHT LOOKING: ROSIN, PORTABLE JUMP TESTS AND PERCEPTION TRAINING - Driveline Baseball",2020-12-31T21:06:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/12/caught-looking-rosin-portable-jump-tests-and-perception-training/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
With the use of sticky substances being the talk of the town these days among MLB pitchers, this study takes an interesting and topical look at what one particular traditional and legal substance (rosin) has on the friction coefficient between the finger and the surface of a baseball.
For a long time, rosin has been used to change the feel of how the baseball releases from the pitcher’s hand. The friction coefficient is one way to quantify this characteristic by basically describing how much force it takes to slide a finger across the surface of a baseball. The idea is that with a higher friction coefficient, it’s more sticky and therefore harder for the ball to slide across the finger, leading to the ball rolling off the finger instead of sliding and causing more rotation (more spin) of the baseball.
The illegal sticky substances that have recently been talked about, such as pine tar, are seemingly used to increase the friction coefficient, but rosin has less of a clear-cut purpose. This study looks at the effects of rosin on the fraction coefficient in wet and dry conditions.
10 young adult male subjects participated, sliding their dominant hand’s index finger across leather removed from a baseball and attached to a force measurement device.
They tested the effect when there was a large normal force (subjects pressing down really hard) and when there was a small normal force (subjects did not push down their finger very hard) Yamaguchi et al. found that:
When the subjects put a lot of pressure on the surface (large normal force)
When the subject put little pressure on the surface (small normal force)
Basically, when the ball is wet, rosin makes the ball “more sticky” when applying a lot of pressure, but in all other conditions, rosin makes the ball less sticky. This would suggest that if you are hoping to throw a stickier ball, then rosin is best to use when the ball or your hand is wet. Alternatively, there may be times when you want the ball to be less sticky, in which case, it looks like rosin would be a good option.
As mentioned above, rosin has been used for a long time and likely for reasons other than trying to make the ball more sticky. From personal experience, it felt like rosin made the ball less sticky. Nonetheless, this is good information for pitchers who use rosin to know the effect it may have on the spin characteristics of their pitches. With these results, you would think that rosin will decrease the pitcher’s spin rate in most cases.
As force plate assessments (jump testing, specifically) become more and more common in the integration of skilled and S&C training settings, it is useful to identify valid tools for measurement that are more accessible than force plates. Although force plates are considered the gold standard for many force and jump testing assessments, they are inaccessible to many due to price.
Watkins et al. at the Auckland University of Technology validated three portable and accessible vertical jump assessment technologies measuring the squat jump, counter-movement jump, and drop jump. Two-dimensional motion capture with video, G-Flight, and Push were the three technologies compared to the gold-standard force plate measurement.
Two-dimensional motion capture was done using an iPhone with a front-view of the athlete, which was later imported to Kinovea for frame-by-frame manual analysis. G-Flight is an optical-based timing system with sensors placed on either side of the force plates, and the PUSH accelerometer-based sensor was placed on the subjects’ lower back using a strap.
A range of statistical tests and descriptions were used to exhibit the three measurement tools’ validity with force plates in terms of jump height, contact-time, and reactive strength index. The authors concluded that reactive strength index (jump height divided by contact-time) was the most valid across the three technologies. The results for each of the three technologies include the following:
Two-dimensional motion capture:
G-Flight:
PUSH:
Overall, for a coach, parent, or player who wants to implement jump testing assessments or monitoring, motion capture is the most accurate if processing time and effort is not a priority. G-Flight would be best for larger groups despite slightly larger variability because the processing time is short, and it is easy to switch between athletes (no physical attachment to the subject).
PUSH had reasonable variability, but its use becomes cumbersome for groups due to switching the unit between subjects. Overall, it is clear that accessible and portable alternatives to force plates exist. And lastly, with the appropriate considerations, including jump assessments into an athlete’s training/monitoring is a reasonable venture.
There are several products on the market created to train vision and perception skills in hitting that are video-based. Most of them do not include the actual task of swinging a bat but rather identifying a pitch, working on timing, identifying a strike vs. a ball, etc. Nasu et al. in Japan did a study with softball hitters that suggests the action of swinging a bat is important for assessing their perception skill.
This study included an assessment of identifying a “fast ball” or a “slow ball” from a live pitcher by actually swinging and trying to hit the pitch, as well as an assessment of identifying the pitch and pushing a button without having to try to hit the pitch. To compare these two assessments, a timing measurement was created to determine how accurately the hitters adjusted the initiation of their swing to the different pitch speeds. This measure was then correlated to hitting performance measured by exit velocity and whiff percentage.
The same hitters then did the same activity, but instead of trying to hit the pitch, the subjects were instructed to push a button when it was a fastball as fast as possible. This identification performance was then compared to their exit velocity and whiff percentage to see how well it correlated to hitting performance. The authors found that the batting task explained almost twice as much of the variance in batting performance (67%) than the button-pressing task (34%).
I’ll start this discussion by mentioning how this study is limited by the study design because I believe that for the most valid comparison of the two conditions, in the button-pressing task, the subjects should have been instructed to time the pressing of the button when the pitch crosses the strike/swing zone as opposed to pressing it as soon as they identify the pitch type. However, the significantly improved predictive performance of the batting task goes to show you that it is important to incorporate the actual act of swinging the bat in these perception tasks.
If including an actual swing in a live test describes the batters’ ability by almost double that of a non-swinging task, it seems reasonable that training perception without actually swinging a bat will not yield optimal results. Not-to-mention, this study was done against a live pitcher. I imagine it would be even less descriptive of batter ability if the test was done while facing a virtual pitcher from a video.
This isn’t to say that using the currently-available vision and perception training tools will not work—we have not done any training studies ourselves—but the transferability should be considered when training hitters’ vision and perception in non-live scenarios. In summary, it looks like this is more evidence to suggest training against live arms, in a live situation, is important.

"Caught Looking: Batter Eye Movement, Arm and Elbow Injuries - Driveline Baseball",2020-12-17T19:59:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/12/caught-looking-batter-eye-movement-arm-and-elbow-injuries/,"Here are two studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
We’ve written a lot about the value of workload monitoring for pitching with more detail than throw or pitch count alone—including throw intent, throw distance, warm-up throws, throws in the field, and taking into account the accumulation of volume over some amount of time, among other things.
A lot of that conversation has been around the potential for tools like MotusTHROW to improve that process, but none of that data has directly highlighted the importance of incorporating more workload context than this paper.
Shitara et al. recently published a prospective study of daily maximum intent throws and their relationship with elbow and shoulder injury incidence.
90 pitchers were separated into groups based on how many average daily throws they executed (lower volume group had 38 pitchers, higher volume group had 52 pitchers); the cutoff to separate the groups was determined using a receiver operating characteristics analysis (basically, they used a quantitative approach for the cutoff rather than just choosing a random number).
The authors found that:
Let me preface this discussion because there many factors going into injury.
Looking at the relationship between injury and one single measurement is a significant limitation in itself (and kind of the point of this summary, honestly). There is a lot of potential bias in this categorization of pitchers, including the fact that those who threw more pitches were likely more conditioned for throwing more pitches, which undoubtedly impacts injury risk. It is not to say that the authors of this piece thought this was the best measurement of workload, but this really highlights the use of more involved workload measurements.
It is clear with these results that counting pitches is limited when it comes to avoiding injury. Some things that could potentially improve upon this measure of workload:
Lastly, this discussion is in the frame of avoiding injury, but think about the implications this can have for performance. If we can promote better recovery and put athletes in situations where they are more ready to perform as measured by their accumulated workload, they will absolutely perform better.
This is not all for a sales pitch for MotusTHROW, but MotusTHROW happens to cover all of these bases. I hope that this interesting study and other workload management studies can continue making it clear that quantitative and contextual workload monitoring is a tool that can be used by the entire baseball industry to improve performance and mitigate injury risk.
This study is a bit denser and uses more of a basic science approach to describing how we should approach youth overhand throwing training. It should be noted that this is very theoretical work. Part of this analysis gets pretty ‘noisy’ as far as some of the data modeling goes, but the idea is very interesting.
Tsutsui et al. at Waseda University in Japan looked at the inertial properties (mass and size) of the forearm and how it develops over a young man’s growth compared to shoulder musculature. This is important because the large amount of stress placed on the elbow and the shoulder in the throw arise from accelerating the forearm, hand, and ball toward the throwing target.
If shoulder musculature development lags behind an increase in inertia (the size and weight of the object the shoulder needs to move) of the forearm, then that discrepancy in time could mean that the shoulder is unfit to withstand that increase in load until it catches up to the development of the forearm/hand mass.
This experiment found that with some modeling, the peak inertia value of the forearm and hand mass peaked about 4 months earlier than the peak shoulder musculature, which could theoretically mean that there is an average of about four months between the ages of 12 and 13 years old when these athletes are more at risk for a shoulder injury.
This timeline is created from a small group of 8 to 14-year-olds, so it cannot be generalized.
This analysis is limited—as far as application goes—because we cannot be sure that this difference in peak forearm inertia and peak shoulder musculature actually leads to an imbalance of loading the tissues in the arm.
We also don’t know that lean body mass in the shoulder explains one’s ability to create or withstand the forces during the throw. It is known that the inertia of the forearm and hand mass alone does not explain the load that is placed on the shoulder—how fast it is being moved and in what direction is important. Lastly, this sample only included athletes from the ages of 8 to 14 years old—which cannot explain the relationship between forearm/hand inertia development and shoulder musculature in older, more developed athletes.
That being said, this is an interesting way to look at the development of young athletes and highlights how we might want to pay more attention to the load they place on their bodies throughout these development years. Maybe when athletes are in this rapid-development phase of their life, we can emphasize workload monitoring and not overload their conditioning level.
Not to continue beating a dead horse about workload monitoring/management, but it’s clear it has a place in the future of baseball.
Vision research is back.
At The Ohio State University, Fogt et al. looked at eye and head movements of two different hitters using a pupil tracking system, an internal measurement unit (IMU), and an electromagnetic motion capture device. This article is also more on the research (less applied) side of things, but it adds to the evidence suggesting that the ball is tracked by hitters to some extent, at least by skilled hitters.In this study, they used the rotational movements of the eyes and head to compare the hitters’ gaze position to the ball’s position with respect to the hitter. They found that both hitters (former D3 college baseball players) followed similar head movement patterns throughout the pitch.
Both hitters:
However, one hitter moved their eyes downward for the first 450ms while the other did not move their eyes much at all. Although as with much of the vision research in baseball thus far, it wasn’t collected during a live setting but rather against a pitching machine throwing tennis balls.
More research needs to be done comparing elite hitters to non-elite hitters to identify elite vision patterns, but even more research still needs to be done on how to train it.
The main takeaway from this paper is that head movement is important in tracking the baseball. There may be a differentiation in how different hitters use their eyes in combination with their head movement to pick up the most information about the pitch to make quality contact.
This week’s edition was heavy on the theory and research side of R&D, but this information can still be used long-term to improve how we approach training for baseball players.

"Caught Looking: Change of Direction Ability, Warm-up Effects and Dry Cupping - Driveline Baseball",2020-12-04T05:10:47+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/12/caught-looking-change-of-direction-ability-warm-up-effects-and-dry-cupping/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
When considering how important change of direction in baseball might be, it may seem inconsequential to sports like tennis or basketball. However, without analyzing the association between things like change of direction performance and base stealing or various defensive metrics (that can be for another day), I believe change of direction has the potential to be a considerable predictive measurement.
A study in the European Journal of Sport Science looked at the association between vertical and horizontal force-velocity measures and change of direction performance using a modified 505 test (similar to a shuttle test) in 54 male athletes. Tennis, basketball, and soccer athletes were included in the sample.
Vertical force-velocity profiling was done using a validated method incorporating body mass, jump height, and push-off height during loaded and unloaded counter-movement jumps, and horizontal force-velocity profiling was done using a continuous horizontal velocity measurement with a Stalker ATS Radar Device.
Baena-Raya et al. found that the performance measures of the horizontal force-velocity profile were more closely associated with change of direction performance than vertical force-velocity profile measures. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was as high as -0.941 (-1.0 would be a perfect negative association) between maximum theoretical force and change of direction performance for the non-dominant side of tennis players.
This means that an increase in maximum theoretical force in the horizontal direction was associated with a decrease in change of direction score (which is better; lower time = faster). Additionally, change of direction performance exhibited significant correlations with sprint times across the board.
Correlation between maximum theoretical horizontal force and change of direction performance on the athlete’s non-dominant side. All three correlations are statistically significant.
Despite the lack of baseball players in this sample and not knowing the true impact of change in direction performance on in-game baseball performance, the main takeaway from this study can be that horizontal force-velocity profiling may be a valid measurement for position players in baseball.
If we assume that change of direction is an important aspect of playing the field and running the bases in baseball, then a simple measure (done with some code/spreadsheets and a Stalker ATS II) of an athlete’s horizontal force-velocity profile may be a worthwhile strength and conditioning assessment addition.
Dry cupping is a common therapy for soft tissue discomfort in baseball. Other therapies are also widespread—including Graston—which are often tough to quantify and standardize.
For example, when an operator is providing dry cupping therapy, how much air to pump out of the cups, how long to leave the cups attached to the skin, the location and size of the cups, and whether or not to avoid a specific area of somebody’s body are all things that can be inconsistent between users. The experience of the operator is most commonly relied upon to make these judgments while providing the therapy.
In an interesting effort to quantify the use of dry cupping, Chiu et al. in Taiwan tested an electronic system for measuring negative pressure inside the cups and the distance which the skin moved during the cupping therapy. Optical sensors to measure distance and pressure sensors were placed inside the cups and were wired to a processor to provide quantitative measurements of the cupping therapy.
Two groups were created, 9 baseball players with subjectively identified myofascial pain syndrome and 9 players without, and were given four weeks of dry cupping therapy with 6 cups for 15 minutes, two times per week, with the same pressure.
The two groups were evaluated for qualitative shoulder and arm function, internal pressure trends of the cups during the 15-minute cupping sessions, and the distance and compliance of the skin (basically how much the skin moved during the cupping session with the fixed* amount of force/pressure. The main findings of this study were:
All in all, there aren’t many takeaways from this that will change when, why, or who gets dry cupping therapy. One positive, however, is that both groups showed an improvement in shoulder function. Whether that is due to the cupping, measurement error, or an unknown confounding factor, we can’t be 100 percent sure.
This study is more of an interesting look into the quantification of cupping’s effects and specifications than a drastic change of approach with dry cupping in baseball players.
However, this study does do a good job of highlighting the limitations associated with these types of therapy. They are very often reliant upon the experience and subjective judgment of the operator. At some point in the near future, maybe instrumented cups will be used for this type of therapy to allow for its standardization and even improve its effectiveness.
As we move to more standardized warm-ups in our program, it seems appropriate to consider how warming up affects athletic performance. Many warm-ups are non-standardized and vary in specificity, but understanding the effects of warm-up intensity is important for creating a protocol that will sufficiently prepare an athlete for performance.
Tsurubami et al. looked into warm-up intensity and its effect on heart rate, muscle temperature, subjective fatigue level, and countermovement jump (CMJ) performance. These measures were taken at three different time intervals after the warm-up was completed: immediately after, 10 minutes after, and 20 minutes after completing the warm-up. The warm-up intensities that were tested included a 15-minute warm-up at 80% VO2 max, 60% VO2 max, and no warm-up, all completed on a treadmill.
The experimenters found that, as you might expect, heart rate, muscle temperature, subjective fatigue, and CMJ jump height increased after the warmup for the experimental groups and decreased as time went on. Additionally, the high-intensity warmup (80% VO2 max for 15 minutes) elicited significantly higher heart rate, subjective fatigue, and muscle temperature at almost all post-warm-up time points.
CMJ Jump height as a function of warm-up intensity and length of time post-warm-up. ‘Post’ is immediately after the warm-up, ‘Post 10’ is 10 minutes post-warm-up, and ‘Post 20’ is 20 minutes post-warm-up. This figure is a rough estimate of the data presented in the study.
This leads us to believe that higher intensity warm-ups are more ideal; however, subjective fatigue was significantly greater in the high-intensity condition immediately after completing the warm-up. Additionally, although mean jump height was higher in the high-intensity warm-up condition than the other conditions at all time-points, the difference wasn’t significant.
There are a few limitations to this study, including sample size (though the within-subjects comparison alleviates some of this), and specificity.
Since running on a treadmill isn’t specific to the jumping task, it’s possible that these results would be different with a more specific warm-up activity. Additionally, the effect of warm-up intensity on jump performance may not be the same effect observed in a more applied, skilled task such as throwing a baseball or swinging a bat. Despite these limitations, the experimental design does an awesome job of exhibiting the importance of an intentional warm-up and how intensity can affect an athlete’s subsequent performance.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week — November 19 - Driveline Baseball,2020-11-20T04:37:48+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/11/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-november-19/,"Here are two studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
As we get closer to implementing 3D motion capture with our gold-standard biomechanics lab in hitting (which we primarily use for pitching assessments), studies like this one by Kazumichi Ae and company can help us familiarize ourselves with more specific measurements that matter in the swing.
This study looks at using a simulation model to find how the upper body can be optimized for bat speed and distributing forces on the bat between the hands.
Since we talk a lot about how bat speed works, it’s interesting to look at how a computer simulation would adjust the upper body movement in the swing to optimize bat speed. Basically, how this works:
When optimizing the swing to reach 40 m/s (~89 mph), the results of the simulation showed the model making these changes shortly before ball contact to achieve such a bat speed (all changes were small in magnitude):
This type of analysis is powerful because, without a simulation, we rely on measuring the best hitters (or at least the hitters with the highest bat speeds) to learn what is required to achieve this elite swing behavior. Properly constrained optimizations give us the ability to use what we do know from athletes that we have measured to project what changes can be made to push the bat speed envelope.
Not to mention, who is to say that the current elite hitters (by bat speed) are achieving their bat speed ceiling? It’s possible that even the best of the best can make changes to improve their bat speed.
One of the main benefits of using a more involved workload tracking system than counting pitches like wearing an IMU (sensor-based movement measurement) device is that you can not only count all throws instead of just pitches, but you can also gauge the intensity of the throws using the magnitude of the IMU measurements.
These are things that the MotusTHROW system currently does to calculate workload, but this group did a similar project with their own sensor setup.
Rose et al. at the University of Michigan created a system that uses an IMU sensor to measure movement for some workload research. The data from this measurement was used to automatically detect throws and estimate the intensity after a model was trained with some practice and warmup data.
The model accurately detected low, medium, and high intensity throws correctly about 97%, 87%, and 68% of the time, respectively. Additionally, even though the high-intensity throws were significantly less accurate, the model classified them as medium intent throws for about 85% of those errors. This model was then used to monitor throw count and intensities for a team of 11 11U baseball players throughout the season.
An interesting finding from this group was that three athletes had very similar throw counts and high-intensity throw counts, but one was a position player, and the two others were frequent pitchers. The difference, however, is that the position player had more medium-intensity throws than the two pitchers who had more low-intensity throws than the position players.
Although this could be a limitation of data collection (sensors were not always charged, so some data was missed), it could also highlight the importance of considering the effects of fielding throws in workload. If we aren’t counting the throws a position player makes in the field and only the throws they make off the mound, we are likely getting a very inaccurate and incomplete picture of the load being placed on his body and arm.
It is exciting to see more in-depth workload monitoring becoming more common in all of baseball and specifically at the youth level. We in youth baseball have historically primarily used in-game pitch counts to monitor and enforce workload restrictions. I think this provides an opportunity to avoid some potential injuries and improve performance, in addition to more effective physical development for better, long-term athletic careers.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week — November 5 - Driveline Baseball,2020-11-06T05:16:19+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/11/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-november-5/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
Studying the skill of command in pitching seems like an easy task—but that’s not necessarily true without conducting a controlled experiment. Using in-game data and video makes it doable, but you have to assume the target is where the catcher’s glove is, which is a less-than-perfect measurement of the pitcher’s target.
Ogawa et al. at the University of Tokyo studied the difference in pitching command performance between different athletes’ age groups. There were 78 total athletes, including elementary schoolers, middle schoolers, high schoolers, and college baseball players. Command was looked at holistically but also separated into two categories: “form” and “release timing.”
The way these are separated, release angle (what they attribute to “form” or mechanics), and release timing, is very interesting. The location spray charts that were measured in this study generally followed an ellipse-type shape of which the orientation matched the athlete’s arm slot.
For example, the righties had ellipses that were rotated clockwise. This ellipse was then evaluated by measuring the length of the “minor axis” (the shorter dashed line in the figure below which the authors attributed to mechanics) and the “major axis” (the longer dashed line in the figure below which the authors attributed to release timing.
Along with pitching velocity, they found that the following performance command metrics were affected by age group:
Theoretically, older athletes had improved release/arm slot *angle* consistency and/or release dynamics of the baseball but did not show significantly more consistent release timing.
This study is limited in generalizability by the setting in which data was collected since the participants didn’t need to compete against an opponent and they weren’t pushed to throw their pitches as hard as they could, but this is a very interesting approach.
Separating the pitch location spread into two directions corresponding to different aspects of command or control seems like it might be a good way to get more granular with the skill of command without collecting actual movement data from the pitcher. This is even something you could do with publicly available MLB pitch data—tag us on Twitter if you run some cool analyses @DrivelineBB.
With sensor-based products ever increasing in the baseball and sports training space, validating these products and understanding their respective strengths and limitations is important. In fact, as many of you likely know, much of the work in our research department involves validating measurement technology. One such technology used for training is an IMU-sensor-based velocity measurement tool that is used for strength and conditioning purposes.
Orser et al. at the Canadian Sport Institute completed a validation study of the Push Band 2.0 for tracking bar velocity in a squat jump. The authors compared Push Band’s measurements to force plate measurements, assuming that force plates are the gold standard for velocity and power measurements.
Bar velocity is often measured to assess power and speed in the weight room and/or provide training feedback for athletes during their sessions. This can be done with a cable-type system like the Tendo device or can be done with movement sensors like those used in the Push Band. We have done an abbreviated validation test for a couple of similar products (Push included) that can be found here, but these authors completed a more involved and robust evaluation of the Push Band.
The Push Band during the squat jump:
Coefficients of Determination between the Push Band and Force Plates (more is better)
Upper limit of agreement between Push Band and Force Plates (less is better)
The authors’ main takeaways are that Push can be used as a reliable velocity measurement tool but not to estimate power. They discuss a couple of reasons why the observed error in power was so high, one of which being their bucketed analysis which analyzed each load individually (less loads, higher velocity, higher error trends).
The other main consideration they discussed was the difference in models for how power is calculated by Push and by the force plate software they used, a conversation for another blog but a likely reason for some of the large error in power. All things considered, bar velocity can still be used for training feedback to drive intent in the weight room, so the results of this study (and our abbreviated in-gym analysis) suggest that Push may be a usable option for adding some feedback to your weight room—even if it doesn’t estimate power very well.
Many athletes use foam rolling in their warm-up protocol.
There are some conflicting opinions and some conflicting commentaries on the usefulness of foam rolling and its tangible effects. These potential effects include movement effects, performance effects, and even more subjective measures like comfort level.
This commentary by David Behm and others reviews the foam rolling literature and uses effect sizes to measure how the number and duration of sets among other aspects of foam rolling technique affect range of motion, performance, and fatigue. With very low effect sizes on performance (jumping and sprinting) and fatigue (small sample), this study’s analysis suggests that the best increases in ROM come when the foam rolling involves:
These are broad suggestions that leave a lot of room for individuals to adjust how they see and feel is fit for their case, but at the very least, it shows that foam rolling for an hour before your workout may not actually provide many benefits.
One major thing to keep in mind is that this review includes studies investigating foam rolling on various joints/body segments, with different foam rolling protocols and different measurement types. As always, take these results with a grain of salt, but we can be confident that a little bit of foam rolling in a warm-up protocol can be worthwhile.

An Introduction to Seam-Shifted Wakes and their Effect on Sinkers - Driveline Baseball,2020-11-02T09:12:30+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/11/more-than-what-it-seams-an-introduction-to-seam-shifted-wakes-and-their-effect-on-sinkers/,"Chances are that if you’re reading this blog post, you’ve had the fortune of watching a Mariano Rivera cutter, a Roy Halladay sinker, or a Pedro Martinez changeup – generational pitches that seemingly defied the naked eye as they approached home plate.
Beyond having elite movement profiles, the three pitches above are probably best known for possessing “late” movement– the label often used by scouts, coaches, and players to describe pitches that seemingly change direction just before crossing home plate.
If you talk to most scouts who have racked up countless innings behind home, they’ll often tell you that this late, darting movement is a prerequisite to a plus pitch. Not only do scouts believe late movement on a pitch exists – it’s often what they look for when evaluating a given pitcher.
However, if you talk to most physicists, they’ll tell you that late movement is nothing more than an optical illusion – a function of Newton’s Second Law that deceives us into thinking a new force has been imparted on the ball mid-flight when, in fact, a pitch was moving exactly how we’d expect it to given the spin, release point, and velocity parameters of the pitch itself at ball release.
With such a gap between experiential and theoretical knowledge, what gives? Are there other forces in play that affect ball movement and have gone unnoticed after all these years? If so, are these forces significant, trainable, and noteworthy – or are we just getting caught up in an optical illusion?
Prior to the 2020 season, no large-scale evidence had really been found to support either side of the theoretical “unexpected break” debate, as no pitch-tracking technology had been able to reliably compare how a pitch should move (given it’s spin and velocity parameters at release) with how it actually moved during its full trajectory.
Enter Hawk-Eye, the new tracking system of choice for MLB in 2020, which finally gives us access to enough data points to help answer the question of whether pitches can change their shape on the path to home plate.
When we compare projected and actual movement against one another, we get some wild results that have the potential to change pitch design, arsenal optimization, and perhaps pitch evaluation as we know it. Here, we will be taking a deep dive on this effect, otherwise known as the Seam-Shifted Wake Effect, and how it interacts with a pitch that has faded out of the baseball landscape: the sinker.
To fully understand Seam-Shifted Wakes, we have to throw things back to a topic we’ve covered in the past, the Magnus effect (covered in more detail here: Spin Rate Part I, Spin Rate Part II). Most pitch movement is explained by this force, with the movement coming perpendicular to the Spin Axis of a pitch.
For example, for the above right-handed sinker spinning at an axis just higher than 1:30 (233°) at 100% efficiency, we’d expect it to move with just about equal amounts of horizontal break and vertical break (armside run and rise, respectively).
(GIF of Topspinning Cylinder From Wikipedia)
For the object seen above, we can observe that as more topspin is added (like that of a curveball), the airflow that moves towards the top of the object is halted, while the flow on the bottom is deflected upwards. As a result, there is a downward force on the object, reminding us of Newton’s Third Law of Motion (every action has an equal and opposite reaction).
Now, whether you know it or not, you’ve likely seen a very common, real-world example of wake. If you’ve ever observed a duck making its way across a pond, it’s likely that you’ve noticed ripples forming behind it to either side.
(Image of Duck From Reading Weather and Climate Blog)
It’s a silly example, but the image above shows the same phenomenon that happens with any projectile. On either side of the duck (or a projectile), there is flow caused by surface tension, which is likely symmetric in this case (unless the duck has unique features that cause otherwise). In this example, the displaced water behind the duck would be the wake. In the case of a baseball (or the object shown in the GIF), it is instead displaced air.
What makes a baseball so unique is the presence of seams in conjunction with smooth surfaces on the ball itself, potentially allowing for specific grips of the ball to create different movement profiles.
We can see this happening in the GIF below, where a cricket ball is shown with a rough side and a smooth side. As the ball interacts with the air around it, we can see that the turbulent airflow (shown to the left) sticks to the ball longer than the smooth airflow. This results in a deflection that forces the ball to move to the left (from our perspective). This effect on sports balls (and baseballs) was detailed in this paper by Rod Cross.
(GIF of Laminar Flow From Vertasium)
While the above is certainly applicable to all kinds of sports, it was a splitter thrown by Freddy Garcia in 2011 that really garnered the baseball community’s interest. While most splitters move to the armside with a small amount of backspin, this pitch moved in the opposite direction.
It is well known that throughout baseball’s history, many pitchers have employed “spitballs” or “scuffballs”, which oftentimes resulted in movement profiles that are irregular due to the alterations made to the surface of the baseball.
(The axis of rotation from this pitch suggests spin should deflect the pitch up and in to the batter, rather than down and away.)
In dissecting the above pitch, Alan Nathan was able to determine (using PITCHf/x data) that much of that splitter’s acceleration wasn’t explained by Magnus force, but rather laminar/turbulent airflow (or boundary layer asymmetry).
Dr. Barton Smith and his colleagues at USU have made it their passion to uncover some of the underlying components behind the “Laminar” pitch, publishing their research here, as well as coining the more descriptive term Seam-Shifted Wake in the process.
Their work has pushed the public’s understanding of Seam Shifted Wake pitch to new heights, potentially changing how we view and evaluate pitches for a long time to come.
(An image of Driveline’s visit to the USU  Experimental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in January of 2019. From left to right: Dean Jackson, Kyle Boddy, Barton Smith, Nazmus Sakib, Eric Jagers and Joe Marsh.)
With all this history in mind, the main concept to grasp is that when you break the symmetry of a wake (creating turbulence on one side), you can create force, and thus movement, that isn’t typical. This can be achieved through seam orientation, hence a “Seam-Shifted Wake”.
We are choosing to focus on sinkers to get the ball rolling due to a variety of reasons. First, most work on the subject of Seam-Shifted Wakes in baseball has focused on pitches that move armside, primarily sinkers/two-seamers and changeups. This would make a deep dive into sinkers logical, as we can take steps to corroborate already established, public-facing work. Additionally, the effect seems to be the most pronounced amongst sinkers, making them a logical jumping-off point into further study/analysis of SSW.
Second, to properly do a deep dive on breaking balls (especially sliders), we would need access to spin vectors. These are currently not available in public data provided by MLB, so that is a roadblock to a deeper analysis of those pitches. This is due to the fact that for breaking balls (and any pitch with sub 100% efficiency), some amount of gyrospin is converted to transverse spin during ball flight due to the descent and Spin Axis of the ball itself.
For sinkers, because Spin Efficiency is closer to 100% relative to other secondary pitch types, we don’t have to be as concerned about these effects taking place, better isolating the Seam-Shifted Wake effect. Additionally, the conversion of gyro to transverse typically moves pitches to the gloveside, while we’re specifically looking at an arm-side effect here.
Of course, there isn’t a variable that simply comes right out and says “SSW Effect”, so we have to do a touch of work (and make some assumptions) to see if this effect actually is taking place. We chose to imply the existence of a Seam-Shifted Wake for sinkers by comparing the Inferred Spin Axis (or Spin Direction) from movement to the actual Observed Spin Axis values provided by Hawk-Eye. We chose to call this difference (in degrees) “2D Axis Deviation”.
For both righties and lefties, a positive 2D Axis Deviation signifies a case where the movement of a pitch would suggest a more vertical Spin Axis than what Hawk-Eye believes actually occurred at release (controlled for handedness).
For example, if the Inferred Spin Axis for a particular pitch from a righty was 270°, and the Observed value was 250°, that would result in a 2D Axis Deviation of +20°. Pitches with a positive 2D Axis Deviation are moving more to the arm-side and/or down than we’d expect based on their directly Observed Spin Axis, implying the effect of a Seam-Shifted Wake. Pitches with a negative 2D Axis Deviation generate less arm-side and/or sinking movement than we’d expect.
(The above compares Kyle Hendricks’ inferred Tilt (left) to his Observed Tilt (right))
The league average 2D Axis Deviation in 2020 (the only year with Hawk-Eye data) for sinkers was ~17.6°. You can see the full spread in the density plot below.
(Distribution of 2D Axis Deviation for Sinkers thrown during the 2020 Season)
When looking at this effect at the player level, it’s interesting to see several well-known sinkerballers amongst the leaders. Kyle Hendricks and Dallas Keuchel have made careers out of their prolific sinkers, and based on 2020 data, it appears as though those pitches have gained additional movement through a SSW.
(Runs and Expected Runs are scaled on a per-pitch basis, whereas Runs Saved/9 is meant to be a proxy for how many runs that the pitch would outperform expectations by during a 9 inning game.)
In contrast, those in the Bottom 20 are all examples of cases where the pitcher actually generates less traditional two-seam movement on their sinker than their directly Observed Spin Axis would suggest.
(At the player-level, sinkers in 2020 averaged -0.004 Runs, 0.006 Expected Runs, and -0.735 Runs Saved/9)
Though it’s a bit of an inexact science, we scoured the internet for any documentation on grips for those pitchers that had the largest 2D Axis Deviations, and what we found was quite interesting.
Out of the Top 20, twelve pitchers were documented in some form of media (articles, video, Twitter) as throwing a variation of a one-seam sinker. While this grip comes in many forms, it primarily involves one or both fingers living on only one seam of the baseball, rather than sitting between or on top of the tracks of the ball.
This is surprising, as before, the poster child of Seam-Shifted Wakes among sinkers/two-seamers was the Laminar Express. And while some pitchers in the Top 20 still throw a variant of that pitch, it appears as though a majority of the other top deviators threw a member of the one-seamer family.
As an example of this, note the Edgertronic footage below of an in-gym athlete that had a >20° 2D Axis Deviation this past season. Despite the axes on his four-seamer and one-seamer having just a ~1° of measured difference at release, the inferred difference between the pitches amounted to nearly 30° during the 2020 season. This SSW effect helped the athlete generate nearly 5 inches of run and 6 inches of drop off of his four-seamer, giving him a unique GB-inducing weapon in his arsenal.
(One-Seamer (Top) is paired with a fourseamer (bottom) from the same athlete. Despite having the same reported axes, both pitches varied significantly from one another in terms of movement)
By comparing the actual run values of sinkers thrown in 2020 to the run values that we expected based on our arsenal scores, we can get a sense if this additional effect on the baseball adds any in-game value. The following plot tries to describe this relationship.
(Run values at the pitch level for Sinkers during the 2020 Season.)
As we can see, there’s a pretty direct relationship between 2D Axis Deviation and Run Value – Expected Run Value (our arsenal score). This suggests that pitches with a greater SSW effect outperform expectations. But, does this deviation explain anything in regards to just pure runs?
Controlling for arm angle, velocity, and pitch movement (horizontal and vertical), we found that 2D Axis Deviation does explain some decrease in runs at the pitch-level. Additionally, running the above features through a variable importance algorithm, 2D Axis Deviation consistently ranked ahead of release speed and horizontal break in regards to importance in relation to run value, coming in just behind vertical break.
(Variable Importance (in relation to Runs) at the pitch-level)
Given the abbreviated nature of the 2020 MLB season, we are going off of a limited sample, but at the introductory level, it does appear that Seam-Shifted Wake sinkers beat expectations and the magnitude of the effect itself plays an important role in predicting run values on their own.
Though we are just now scratching the surface with sinkers, it’s clear that other pitch types, primarily changeups and sliders, warrant a closer look. If MLB were to release spin vectors publicly, we could directly measure metrics like spin efficiency, spin based movement, and others that are necessary for an in-depth look (especially with sliders).
We are also hoping to conduct further investigation into the one-seam sinker at our facility in an attempt to see if that pitch (or grips/orientations within that family) allow us to “hack” SSW. Our current hypothesis is that sinkers within the one-seamer family, along with Laminar Express-style pitches, are more prone to taking advantage of this effect.
From a trainer/athlete perspective, the concept of a Seam-Shifted Wake can be summarized with the following: because of how the seams of the baseball interact with the air around the ball during flight, specific orientations of the baseball at release can give an athlete access to movement profiles that normally would only be achievable by shifting their arm slot or Spin Axis drastically.
There is certainly still more work here to be done, but it appears as though Seam-Shifted Wake pitches are real, and quite valuable if you can find the right combination of forces. Being able to validate this effect, bridging the gap between experiential and theoretical knowledge, is massive in understanding how pitches play at the major-league level, and gives credence to all those in the game that have seen this take place with the naked-eye for decades.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week — Oct. 22 - Driveline Baseball,2020-10-23T04:24:11+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/10/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-oct-22/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
A few weeks ago, in the 8/27 edition of Caught Looking, we discussed a motor learning study from Dr. Rob Gray at Arizona State University. This study looked into the idea of “freezing” and “freeing” degrees of freedom when learning a task. Basically, this is just the idea that we simplify new tasks by disabling certain joint movements when we are learning them to coordinate a solution to the task easier. As we become better at the task, we begin to “free” those disabled joint movements since we can afford for the task to become a bit more complex to create more optimal task solutions.
Palmer et al. investigated this theory in addition to a few other learning theories and paradigms that have been proposed for overhand throwing. This study used 3D motion capture to compare the overhand throwing mechanics of six participants in each of three age groups: six years old, 10 years old, and 14 years old. The groups’ throwing mechanics were compared to measure how throwing mechanics change as a function of age to compare to a similar study looking into how adults learn to throw with their non-dominant hand.
There were three measurement types used to compare mechanics and coordination between age groups:
Based on these measures of throwing mechanics, there were changes observed as a function of age. Those were:
This study is limited by skill level and age representation (only captures participants 6 to 14 years of age) and by sample size (6 athletes in each group). Additionally, it is limited by outcome measures since none of the three measurement groups capture the three groups’ micro-scale mechanical differences or proficiencies. Consequently, this study is interesting and potentially useful on the motor learning side as we learn more about how humans (specific to non-overhand throwing athletes) learn the motion of throwing overhand—but has little value in training elite throwing populations.
On the other hand, it does provide some additional evidence toward the theory of freezing and freeing degrees of freedom while learning new tasks, which, as mentioned in the discussion of Gray’s study, can absolutely be used for training high school, college, and even potentially professional overhand-throwing athletes. Freezing and freeing degrees of freedom in training can be done using constraints and conditions of practice.
This study discusses the relative age effect (RAE) among baseball players and other athletes in Japan—on a different side of the coin that we at Driveline are currently working on.
Why is that the other side of the coin? Because it is innate—we can’t change an athlete’s birth date and the subsequent advantage or disadvantage they have accumulated throughout their sporting career based on where their birth date falls on their sports calendar. The relative age effect is the observation that has been made in various sports for years now, describing the bias in the distributions of birth dates among players of the same sporting age.
For example, the cutoff for age groups in Canadian Hockey is the New Year, so there is a biased distribution of elite hockey players in Canada toward the early months of the year. Sasano et al. looked at this relative age effect in Japanese athletes of multiple sports (N = 7805 total athletes) and compared the effect between four years: 1993, 2001, 2010, and 2018. They found that the magnitude of this effect (the amount of bias) decreased over time in soccer, baseball, and volleyball—but not in basketball.
The underlying mechanism of the RAE is not fully understood. It likely has to do with the playing time and competition opportunities that more developed youth athletes receive if they are older than their peers in the same age group.
If this is the case, it is very interesting that the RAE’s magnitude is on the decline in certain sports because it could mean player development is becoming more robust. The authors of this paper propose a couple of different mechanisms leading to a decrease in RAEs over time, including sports participation, but there seems to be a possible alternative explanation in player development.
If more athletes have access to quality coaching, player development tools, and knowledge, maybe this could be partially explaining the decrease in the RAE bias—this is player development overcoming the advantage given to those born just after athletic age cutoff dates. Additionally, it could be a function of coaches and parents becoming more focused on training than other motivations such as winning or competing in tournaments.
Whatever the mechanism for a decrease in the relative age effect and any other innate or given advantages, it serves as a target for player development techniques to overcome. A great measure of success for player development initiatives would be to effectively improve athletes’ skills enough to overshadow any advantage one has over the other based on an unchangeable factor such as birth date.
In the last edition of Caught Looking, we reviewed a piece about monitoring workload in baseball. Running the risk of overloading you all with workload management discussion, here we feature another editorial about monitoring training load in a general sense for sports. West et al. do a good job in this document framing workload as a tool not necessarily a tool for eliminating all injuries or perfecting every training program, but as a more general tool for more broad use. This use is context.
Five ways in which training load can provide information are described in this paper including: feedback, in-session adjustment, day-to-day planning, season planning, and long-term use. An example of each follows:
The main takeaway from this article—which I think really hits home with the way that workload and Motus should be used for throwing training—is that we don’t expect a perfect prediction of whether or not somebody is going to get hurt. We don’t expect a perfect prediction of whether an athlete is going to gain 2 mph on his fastball within 6 weeks or not.
We do, however, expect it to provide us with the context of training that we wouldn’t otherwise have. That can help us make informed adjustments within-career, within-season, within-training sessions, and within-activity based on more information than a standard and static template.
Monitoring training and workload is not a replacement for athlete management as we know it. Workload and training monitoring is an augmentation to traditional athlete management and coaching to help improve our understanding of how to make athletes better.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week — October 8 - Driveline Baseball,2020-10-08T23:52:49+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/10/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-october-8/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
Much of motor learning literature is a bit out of reach and is not easily applied to baseball and sports training. Still, this study out of the University of Copenhagen results in a takeaway that I believe can be applied in the baseball training environment. Christiansen et al. published the study as a continuation of their previous work investigating the effects of progressing the difficulty of a training task on how quickly and effectively subjects learned a new task.
The present study compared two groups trained with an arcade-like task (similar to the game Breakout for those familiar) with one group progressing in difficulty based on their performance in the game and one group training at the same ‘Day 1’ baseline difficulty for the entire training period.
For the group whose difficulty progressed, the difficulty was chosen based on their performance. It balanced the idea of making the task hard to complete and easy enough to complete, so participants did not lose interest and motivation.
Neural and muscle activity was measured during this experiment, but I will focus on task performance. This study showed that the group whose task difficulty progressed as their task performance increased performed better than the control group at a more difficult task during training and 8 days after training was completed.
Somewhat intuitive, but this shows that you are better off having training and practice with tasks that are closer to the difficulty of where you will be tested to be better at a tougher task.
In baseball terms, if you are going to face a 95 mph fastball, you will perform better if you progress your training difficulty closer to that 95 mph fastball than if you were to focus solely on catching solid barrels against an 85 mph fastball.
As mentioned above, this may be intuitive to many in the baseball industry, but it is still not widely accepted that progressing difficulty in training positively affects training outcomes. This is a good piece to support and motivate us as trainers, coaches, parents, and, last but certainly not least, athletes, to create challenging and creative training environments. Finding the balance between task difficulty and comfort will go a long way in developing a successful on-field performance.
As a part of our high-performance assessment for pitchers, scapular movement during an arm elevation and depression movement is visually assessed to check for proper scapular action and mobility. Identifying insufficient or improper scapular movement during this assessment can improve overall shoulder movement capacity so that it’s less likely to be a cause of pain or injury from throwing.
For a similar purpose, a study out of the Korea National Sport University investigated the effects of an eight-week scapular exercise/training program on the muscle activity in various back and shoulder muscles.
Song et al. put 23 baseball pitchers through a training program including movements that targeted the activation of scapular muscles such as scapular protraction and retraction and movements that resulted in scapular movement such as the push-up plus. The participants included seven athletes with scapular movement and position irregularities or pain and 16 athletes without irregularities as a control group.
After eight weeks of the program, they found there were increases in activation of the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and the serratus anterior during elevation and depression of the arm. Some changes were observed in both groups, though more changes were observed in the group with scapular irregularities and/or pain.
Scapular movement and function are tough to evaluate. Even our current assessment is visual-based and somewhat subjective. This study finds a way to quantify an aspect of scapular activity to evaluate the effectiveness of a program with common scapular movements.
However, we have to remember that muscle activation is tough to interpret, and that more active muscles during arm elevation and depression don’t necessarily mean that the athletes will be significantly more or less healthy in the actual pitching motion. Nonetheless, it’s assuring to know that scapular activation and movement patterns can be altered with proper training if necessary.
For a look at an investigation we did into serratus anterior muscle activation during one of our recovery protocols, check out our kettlebell carry blog.
Last but certainly not least, a review was recently published in the Journal of Athletic training discussing the current state of workload monitoring in baseball pitching. Dowling et al. summarized the idea behind monitoring workload, defined different types of workload, and outlined techniques for monitoring workload.
One important point made by the authors of this publication is that workload should include more than the total volume of activity i.e. number of throws. Workload monitoring should also include the intensity of these throws to better describe the ‘load’ placed on the body. These are described as internal and external components of load, respectively.
Additionally, the authors of this review did an excellent job describing internal and external workload monitoring in ways that can be applied even without a lot of experience, technical ability, budget, etc.
For throwing volume (external load), this can just be done by counting total throws and making sure to include all practice throws such as PFPs and position player throws for two-way players.  For intensity (internal load), this can be described using subjective methods such as rating of perceived exertion, heart rate characteristics, type of throw, etc.
One day workload–the fundamental workload measurement used by MotusTHROW
Lastly, recovery is also important to monitor closely as the final portion of overall workload monitoring. As the volume and intensity of throwing increases, so does the requisite recovery. Using these various tools to monitor load then adjusting recovery time to sufficiently address that load is an important step to mitigating injury risk and improving performance.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week — September 24 - Driveline Baseball,2020-09-25T03:51:06+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/09/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-sept-24/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
Solomito et al. recently published this study investigating the relationships between stride length and a few different biomechanical parameters from an impressive dataset (99 collegiate level pitchers). Stride length is an aspect of pitching mechanics that is often manipulated by players and coaches to achieve desired mechanical and performance outcomes, and many attempts at quantitatively determining its effects have resulted in mixed conclusions.
This experiment tested the association between two different measurements of normalized stride length (stride length divided by body height, stride length divided by lower limb length) to mid-section mechanics, throwing arm joint kinetics (torques and forces on the shoulder and elbow), and ball velocity.
Stride length should be normalized to account for differences in height between pitchers. A taller pitcher will be able to stride farther due to having longer limbs than a shorter pitcher. If we compared the two pitchers and their stride length, we wouldn’t be sure any differences in biomechanics were from the difference in stride length or their difference in height.
The results showed that normalized stride length was associated with a more open mid-section. This means that for throwers who strode farther down the mound relative to their height, they also were more rotated open toward the plate (body more square with home plate and the back stop), and the torso was more tilted forward (chest closer to home plate) at foot plant (when the front foot plants into the ground.
However, a longer normalized stride length was not associated with a change in ball velocity or a change in throwing arm joint kinetics. These are very interesting results that add to a growing number of analyses contributing to our understanding of the stride in the pitching delivery. Samples this large are not very common, which is a significant strength to this experiment.
The study found no significant relationship between normalized stride length and ball velocity or arm joint kinetics
The authors hypothesize that the increases in mid-section rotation and forward tilt associated with increased stride length may contribute to more joint load based on relationships in previously published research. I am not very confident in this association, however, because there was no direct statistical relationship in the present study with an extremely large sample. Nonetheless, the relationship between stride length and mid-section mechanics is still noteworthy. Coaches and players can use it as a potential fix when pitchers are too open or too closed at foot plant.
In more outsider fashion, we reviewed a tennis biomechanics study.
Giles et al. at the University of Western Australia investigated the biomechanical differences in forehand tennis strokes with varying ‘entry speed’—defined as how fast the athlete approached the position where they struck the ball. The reason this was interesting to us was that this environment is similar to what a position player in baseball might be experiencing: having to make a lateral athletic move toward a batted ball, fielding it, and throwing the ball to a target.
This experiment resulted in some statistically significant relationships between entry speed and biomechanics. Those were:
In summary, it seems that participants executed a more significant load during the high entry speed trials. Without being able to apply these findings directly to baseball, my main takeaway is that tennis stroke mechanics (very similar to baseball throwing mechanics) are affected by the way an athlete approaches the throwing cycle.
In baseball, whether that is crow hopping from the outfield, fielding a back-hand ground ball and throwing a runner out at first, doing a run-and-gun workout, or many other potential constraints on the field, mechanics will change. Maybe normal, flat ground training won’t address the particular needs of these situations in the field.
On another note, a constraints-led training approach uses an exploratory approach for the athlete to find movement solutions to a particular task by destabilizing their current learned pattern/solution.
If there are mechanical changes that we aim for in the pitch that also present themselves in a more athletic throw—like fielding a ground ball or throwing off-balance (such as more loaded lower half as seen in this study)—perhaps we can use more creative solutions like this one to teach desired mechanics. A pitcher fielding back-hand ground balls at high speeds for example—food for thought.
For a look into how we approach breaking down mechanics for athletes who train here in Kent, take a look at this blog from last spring.
The Auburn University biomechanics lab is back at it again with another interesting study on softball pitchers.
Dr. Gretchen Oliver et al. experimented with bicep tendon thickness and compared how it changes following a pitching appearance to how kinematics and kinetics change throughout that appearance.
The study basically tells us, “Does bicep tendon thickness change from before to after a pitching workout” and “if so, what mechanical changes are associated with this change in tendon properties.” These ideas could help us better understand potential injury risk, what training we can do to minimize these adverse mechanical changes, and what fatigue indicators we can use to determine when to take a pitcher out of the game.
From this experiment, they found that bicep tendon longitudinal thickness did change from pre- to post-simulated game. Additionally, after separating the participants into a group who experienced a change in tendon properties and a group of those who didn’t, it was found that trunk rotation and trunk flexion changed more from pre- to the post-simulated game in the group that experienced tendon changes. This suggests that certain trunk mechanics may contribute (or are at least associated with) physical properties of the bicep tendon.
Longitudinal thickness is the thickness of the tendon in the direction along the length of the humerus (upper arm)
These are interesting results and ones that will hopefully be built upon in the coming years to better understand the material and functional effects of fatigue from throwing. Injuries are all too common in baseball and softball pitching.
An important note to make when interpreting these results is that the association between tendon property changes and injury rates is unknown. We cannot be sure that the bicep changes measured in this study indicate an increase in injury risk, so the results need to be taken with a grain of salt and cannot be generalized as a solution to the injury problem in baseball softball. However, this is exciting research and excellent work coming out of the Auburn University biomechanics lab, as usual.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week - September 10 - Driveline Baseball,2020-09-11T02:52:08+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/09/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-september-10/,"Shoulder rotation range of motion and isometric strength are two very common measures used to assess movement and health in baseball players, both of which have shown to be affected by throwing training and in-season workload.
Additionally, there is reason to believe that adequate hip movement contributes to increase energy transfer from inferior to superior segments in the kinetic chain (AKA better sequencing the movement of important body segments).
Downs et al. in the Auburn University biomechanics lab looked at how shoulder rotation range of motion and isometric strength changed over a season in two different groups. The first was an intervention group that included an additional lower-body warm-up routine before their throwing protocol. The second was a control group who didn’t participate in the extra warm-up exercises.
The warm-up routine included two sets of ten glute bridge, banded hip abduction, banded hip extension, and banded deep squat exercises. These exercises were chosen based on previous research establishing a relationship between the hip, pelvis, and spine complex muscle activations and muscle activation of scapular muscles (Oliver et al. 2016,; Oliver et al. 2018a; Oliver et al. 2018b).
They found that the group of athletes who completed the pre-throwing warm-up routine lost more stride hip (front hip; left hip for a righty) external rotation but gained more external rotation isometric strength than the control group. Additionally, they maintained shoulder range of motion throughout the season better than the control group in their throwing shoulder.
These findings are interesting because:
Experimental group with lower body warm-up gained less total ROM
More investigations would need to be completed to confirm and further describe the relationship between lower body exercises and throwing shoulder movement. More good work out of Dr. Oliver’s lab at Auburn!
We recently published a blog about pre-pitch strategies for hitters and how pre-ball flight information is an important aspect of predicting pitch information. Takamido et al. at Nagoya University recently published an article supporting a similar conclusion but with windmill softball pitching videos. They investigated the effects of changing “advanced kinematic information” which they manipulated by adjusting the video playback speed of an actual windmill softball pitcher.
The interpretation of this data is tough due to the involved study design and the three different sub-experiments that were completed, but they’re three of the main takeaways:
There are a few serious limitations with this study, including sample size (8 athletes) and the use of video for all aspects of visual cues (neither the pitching movement or the ball flight information were live). However, these analyses can still be used to provide more insight into the role of pre-ball flight visual information.
One additional note is that the use of video is a limitation as far as generalizing these results to live situations. Still, it is also a strength in this study design due to the heightened ability to control the independent variable. Video allowed the experimenters to control the conditions much more effectively than if it were a live scenario.
These findings support the theory (in the aforementioned blog) that a considerable amount of visual information is utilized for pitch trajectory prediction. A clear next step for furthering these results would be to complete a similar experiment with baseball pitchers in a live environment while we control some of the pre-ball flight movement of the pitcher to determine its effect on hitting performance and gaze behavior
Velocity and command are both important aspects of pitching. Does the target location of a pitch affect the pitcher’s ability to do either of these? Dr. Roland van den Tillaar completed a research project with handball players investigating the effects of target location on throwing velocity and throwing accuracy. There were four targets set up in a handball net in quadrant fashion (one in the direction of each corner of the net).
Representation of the target setup for a right-handed thrower
The main findings from this analysis were that ball velocity was higher on the ipsilateral side (throwing arm-side) when compared to throws toward contralateral (glove-side) targets, and accuracy was worse when participants were throwing toward the upper, contralateral-side target (elevated glove-side target) than the other targets. Additionally, there was no trade-off between ball velocity and accuracy for any of the four targets.
These findings are potentially very important because in baseball pitching, pitchers are almost always throwing toward a specific target set-up by the catcher. Maybe pitchers can throw harder to arm-side targets and potentially have better command there. Perhaps this means that command training should be more heavily focused on glove side targets to account for the difference in difficulty locating. Regardless, these are very interesting and applicable results. This is something to look into with more command-focused throwing workouts.
For a closer look and velocity, command, and their relationship, check out our blog on the speed-accuracy trade off.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week — August 27 - Driveline Baseball,2020-08-28T04:06:02+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/08/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-august-27/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
One of the most common applications of biomechanics in pitching is finding metrics that are related to various arm joint kinetics (joint loads). Kinetics in the context of the throwing arm often refers to the forces and torques placed upon the shoulder and elbow joints during the throw.
Often this research is aimed at finding the effect of “performance” increases which is often described as increases in pitch velocity. In this study, Nicholson et al. at the Wake Forest pitching biomechanics lab investigated a relatively large sample of high school and college pitchers to explore the relationship between pitch velocity and two kinetic measurements on the throwing arm:
After using correlational analysis to determine the relationship between pitch velocity and these two measurements of joint load, they found they are both positively correlated to velocity. However, the correlations are weak (r2 = 0.32, r2 = 0.44).
The relationships were stronger in the high school sample than the college sample and were also stronger with slower throwing pitchers than harder throwing pitchers. This means that at lower velocities, an athlete who exhibits larger joint loads in their throwing arm is also likely going to throw harder than another pitcher who exhibits lower throwing arm joint loads, but this relationship doesn’t hold up in harder throwing populations.
Graphics created from Nicholson et al. 2020
This is similar to what Slowik et al. found in 2019 when they looked at the relationship between elbow valgus torque in professional-level pitchers. The relationship between pitch velocity and elbow valgus torque between pitchers in their case was even lower than the present study (r2 = 0.076) which follows a similar trend showing weaker relationships between velocity and joint loads as the level of play and velocity increases.
Additionally, the within-pitcher relationship between pitch velocity and elbow valgus torque is very strong (r2 = 0.957). This means that when comparing harder throwing pitchers to slower throwing pitchers, the relationship between the difference in velocity and the difference in joint loads will be weaker than when comparing the joint loads between a single pitcher’s hardest thrown fastball to their own slower thrown fastball.
As we know, there is a lot involved in being able to throw a baseball at high velocities. These studies suggest that:
Throwing is a very complex movement.
Hitting is a very tough visual task that requires fast and accurate reactions. A study published in the UK looked into the relationship between visual reaction times and gaze stability (how many blinks and saccades the participant executes during a specified time period) to determine if a more stable gaze behavior (less blinks and fast eye movements) can explain the ability to react quickly and accurately.
Barrett et al. investigated a sample of 44 cricketers, 21 rugby players, and 50 non-sporting controls and found a few different relationships worth noting including:
Graphic created with data from Barrett et al. 2020
The study is an interesting look into gaze patterns of elite athletes because it doesn’t use the quiet eye method—common in much of the existing gaze behavior research of elite athletes. includes the use of a quiet eye measurement
Although gaze stability was not measured using this definition of a quiet eye, the gaze stability in the present study still provides a similar description of gaze behavior. Since a longer quiet eye fixation is often associated with better performance, it would seem that a quiet eye will cause better visual perception, which isn’t necessarily supported with the present study from Barrett et al.
This is shown when they controlled for their measure of gaze stability and the visual reaction times did not change between groups. This is a long way of saying that if you have a very stable, and even potentially use a quiet eye strategy, it may not improve your visual reaction times.
The main limitation of this study is that the visual reaction time test was not sport-specific. Visual reaction times were measured using a generic test in which the participants were required to respond to an object appearing on a screen in front of them. This is a limitation because it doesn’t represent the task required by the sports in which the subjects participated in. However, since the athlete groups still performed better than the control groups despite the non-specificity of the task, we can assume that the task at least partially describes the reaction time that would be seen in a sport-specific task.
There is still a lot to learn about the role of vision and perception in baseball and cricket hitting, but this study and many others (including the quiet eye publications mentioned above) slowly contribute to our deeper understanding of how to train this part of hitting. If you want to read more into some of the pre-pitch visual approach research we have done with our gaze tracking system so far, check out our blog here.
Skill acquisition. Without getting too into the weeds here, there is a really cool study from Rob Gray at Arizona State University about a theory of how participants innately approach the learning of a new skill.
There is a theory that when somebody is learning a new movement, one approach is to restrict certain individual movements and movement directions to make the task easier to accomplish. For example, would it be easier to learn how to drive a car if you had to control all four wheels independently or if you could control the speed and direction of all of them with one pedal and one steering wheel? Probably the latter.
The same thing can be done when swinging a bat—if you can move your shoulder in three directions, elbow in two directions, and wrist in two or three directions, that is a lot of joints and movements to control. Conversely, if you limit the movement (freeze them) in any of those directions of movement in your elbow, wrist, or shoulder joint, there is less to control and could potentially make it easier to accomplish the task of hitting a baseball; similar to how controlling all four wheels at once instead of each one independently would make it easier to drive a car.
The important thing to note, however, is when you limit directions of movement, you limit the flexibility (and variability) of the movement. If becoming proficient in a task requires flexibility in movement, and adapting to unique circumstances such as hitting a high pitch instead of a pitch down the middle, or hitting a curveball instead of a fastball, limiting these movements can negatively impact your performance.
So, the theory is that when learning a task, we can limit movements to accomplish a base level of performance (i.e. hitting the ball) and then start to free up these movements as we get more comfortable with the task to accomplish higher levels of performance (i.e. hitting the ball harder or farther).
In this study, Gray looked into the process of unfreezing (freeing) these directions as participants became more proficient in a task. He looked at timing aspects of the swing rather than movement but found evidence that variability in timing increased after a training period, with an associated increase in task performance.
Graphic created with data from Gray, 2020
You can see from pre- to post-training period, as proficiency with the task increases from the six-week training program, their measure of “good variability” increases. This suggests that they unfroze or freed up variability, and different movement solutions as they became better at the test task.
There are many more nuances to this study, but the main takeaway is that the theory of freezing, or limiting the different types of movement that can be used to learn a task and then slowly re-incorporating those movements to help increase task proficiency is supported.
This study is limited to only timing analysis with force plates, but this work can be built upon with other biomechanical measurements to see if movement variability in body segments follows a similar trend to the timing aspects seen in this study.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week — August 13 - Driveline Baseball,2020-08-14T03:09:54+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/08/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-august-13/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
Injury prevention in baseball is often discussed in terms of mechanics and decreasing the load on the body, but understanding tissues’ mechanical properties can also provide insight into how to avoid injury. The better we understand workload and how the body responds to stress throughout the various training cycles and seasons, the better we can address injury risk.
Chalmers et al. conducted a study on minor league baseball players using ultrasound imaging to assess the physical properties of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) at the beginning of a season, at the end of that season, and again at the beginning of the next season. Ligament thickness and laxity (stretchiness) were evaluated at these three points by using the ultrasound imaging. They found that the UCL becomes thicker and more lax (more stretchy) during the season, but becomes thinner and less lax (tighter) during the off-season. This suggests that the UCL responds to the in-season workload by becoming thicker and looser, but during the offseason programs of the included subjects, the UCL became thinner and tighter.
UCL thickness and laxity were measured at three different instances of time
A couple of limitations (which the authors do a good job of addressing): physical properties of the UCL are very difficult to measure, the study only included professional baseball players within the same organization (so likely their training is similar), and longitudinal datasets (data collected over a long time with the same subjects) often have a lot of unwanted contributing factors outside of what is being measured. Despite these limitations, and a few more listed in the study, this study is very insightful for learning how the UCL responds to an in-season and off-season workload. Furthering this research will hopefully allow us to better prepare athletes for the workload of a season and/or adjust in-season workloads appropriately.
Check out our blog about elbow load and its relationship with velocity.
As we continue integrating force plates into our assessments and research here at Driveline, some of those natural progressions include determining what metrics are related to performance (usually pitch velocity) and making a predictive model out of those metrics. For example, we could look at the various force plate metrics that we collect in our jump assessment and create a statistical model to predict how hard they should throw based on their jump performance. 

This is another good example, only with swimming starts. Thng et al. in Australia created a predictive model for swim start times (lower is better; corresponds to a faster start) with “lower body force-time” metrics during the squat jump. The squat jump is a jump in which the subject gets into a preset squat position, holds that position for a non-zero amount of time, and jumps from the squat with no additional counter-movement.
Concentric imPulse—which is equal to force multiplied by time of the force development in the concentric phase of the jump—was found to be a significant predictor of decreased start times to 5 meters and to 15 meters for men and women. A few other metrics such as concentric mean power, reactive strength index, and concentric rate of power development showed some relationship with some of the athlete categories, though not as consistently as concentric imPulse.
The group also found that for males, there seemed to be diminished returns (more performance on this metric wasn’t related to better start times) around 200-230 Ns which is a really cool addition to their statistical analysis.
Percent contribution of the squat jump concentric imPulse metric for predicting swim start times. Made with tabular data from Thng et al.
Although the swimming start is very different from the throw or the swing, this method is a good one to incorporate in our quest to find important ground reaction force (force plate) metrics in baseball. We are currently doing some similar predictive model work based on the jump testing we have done for our in-gym athletes thus far, which we aim to publish in a blog in the coming months.
Read some of our early work with force plates and what we have found relates to pitching velocity.
Keeping your mind in the weight room, let’s switch over to training protocols instead of assessments and tests. Vanderka et al. looked at how the incorporation of instant power production feedback affected the efficacy of a training program by comparing changes in sprint times, three rep maxes, maximum power, and jump heights between an experimental (a group that had instant feedback during training and a control (a group that was not provided power production feedback). They included many different types of athletes.
The experiment showed that in every test except for maximum power, the experimental group who received instant feedback during their training whereas the control group who didn’t receive instant feedback during their training did not significantly improve in any of the tested variables. Further, the control group actually decreased in performance for maximum power, optimal load (the load in which they create the most power), and squat jump height.
Percent change for feedback and non-feedback groups from pre- to post-training period. Made with tabular data from Vanderka et al.
Using performance feedback (power in this case, ball velocity in many throwing programs) is consistently revered as one of the more important parts of achieving training results. This study provides more evidence for this use of instant feedback outside of just the skill. For baseball, maybe that feedback includes bar velocity during lifts, sprint times during sprint training, or power production feedback in addition to the ball velocity and bat speed feedback we currently provide.

Caught Looking: Articles of the Week - July 30 - Driveline Baseball,2020-07-31T04:07:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/07/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-july-30/,"Here are three studies the R&D department at Driveline read this week:
Understanding fatigue can help us better manipulate workload/training economy throughout a season or training program to maximize performance and athlete health. Stone et al. recently studied neuromuscular fatigue in pitchers throughout a DI college baseball season using a counter-movement jump (CMJ).
This study showed reduced CMJ performance from pre-season to mid-season, though the difference was not statistically significant. There were no moderate or large differences in performance between the other times of the season.
Figure made with tabular data from the linked study (Stone 2020)
Decreased CMJ performance over the season could represent general fatigue for an athlete as cumulative workload builds throughout their appearances. Even though CMJ performance can’t necessarily be used as an arm-specific fatigue measurement, it does provide some evidence toward the general neuromuscular fatigue associated with college baseball pitchers’ season. A continued investigation could include a larger sample size and more specific measures of fatigue, such as a change in kinematics, change in release point, velocity, etc.
For more information on neuromuscular fatigue, how we look at it, and some of the factors involved, check out our blog on CNS fatigue.
The way pitchers interact with the ground has often been discussed as an important topic for performance and health in baseball pitching.
Many studies have compared peak forces to performance outcomes like pitching velocity or certain biomechanical parameters such as mid-section positioning. Howenstein et al. furthered this work with a comparison of ground reaction forces (how hard pitchers push off with their back leg and brake with their front leg) and the flow of energy between body segments.
This study found that two measures of ground reaction force correlated to energy flow between pelvis, torso, and arm segments in the pitching motion for youth athletes. Energy flow has shown in the past to be a strong predictor of pitched ball velocity, so finding ways to improve this energy flow would very likely improve velocity.
Interestingly, the authors discuss a theory that the drive, push-off leg plays a more important role in transferring energy into the mid-section body segments (pelvis and torso), which provides a foundation for an effective kinetic chain. They also theorize that the front, braking leg plays more of a role in initiating the rotation aspect of the kinetic chain, which transfers better to the arm and velocity of the ball.
Figure made with tabular data from the linked study (Howenstein 2020)
Only youth athletes (average age around 11 years old) were used for this analysis, so we cannot be sure these same relationships exist for higher levels of competition. Nonetheless, furthering this research with older and more experienced amateur or professional athletes would be very valuable contributions to the pitching biomechanics world.
To read about some of our early ground reaction force research, take a look at this blog from 2017!
Command is a relatively unknown area of pitching biomechanics and the underlying cause of the ability or inability to control where each pitch location has eluded baseball researchers and coaches. Glanzer et al. in 2019 attempted to find this cause by looking at variability in pitching mechanics during assessment sessions at the American Sports Medicine Institute.
In this study, the group was able to create a model that described 58% of the variance in pitch location using only five mechanical measurements: torso tilt,  shoulder abduction, shoulder horizontal abduction, maximum external rotation, and maximum horizontal adduction.
This means that with these five measures, the experimenters were confident they could explain more than half of the variance in pitch location consistency, which could be incredibly valuable.
Consistency in pitching mechanics is commonly thought of as the driver for good command, and relating the variability in these mechanics to pitching command is a step forward for testing those theories.
One note is that this study did not describe whether or not the participants were instructed to throw to the exact same spot, so it is possible the dataset could be improved. Regardless, this is a very exciting corner of baseball research, and we hope to continue making progress to understanding what it takes to achieve elite command.

What is the ideal lateral trunk tilt for an over the top pitcher? Thanks
David – lateral trunk tilt is going to be closely linked to arm slot, which will vary pitcher to pitcher, so there is not a particular lateral trunk tilt we would consider ideal across pitchers. The range of lateral trunk tilt we see from our athletes in gym is from -6 to 30, with the majority of athletes being between 5 and 20. Thus, higher arm slot guys will mostly be in that 10-20 degree range.

Statistical Parametric Mapping: Tall Versus Short Throwers - Driveline Baseball,2020-07-29T03:48:39+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/07/statistical-parametric-mapping-tall-versus-short-throwers/,"A few months ago, we introduced the idea of Statistical Parametric Mapping for our full signal biomechanical data export.
Now, outside of a few tweets here and there, intended to both inform and establish a claim on the extremely niche frontier of applied full signal SPM in the world of sports science, we have been relatively quiet about further SPM findings.
However, we have continued to run many SPM analyses internally, across several factors and controls, to broaden our understanding of the biomechanics behind pitching mechanics.
Many of these comparisons have been inspired by trainer curiosity and intuition—the case with almost all our best internal studies and analyses. They primarily deal with paired comparisons of assessment versus retest biomechanical data (retest data typically being taken around six weeks after the initial assessment).
We’ve also split our population sample not just by velocity, but also by other anatomical measures like height. All data was captured in our gold-standard motion capture lab. The sample sizes of these SPM t-tests vary by control (all were rerun at the end of the v4 pipeline lifeline)—noted in each of the appropriate sections.
Now, let’s do a quick debrief of SPM, covered in our first blog and other sources here and here. To jog your memory:
SPMs are used for treating continuous functions of time and/or space, like biomechanical full signals. Essentially, statistical tests are performed on every signal point, and a full SPM is constructed out of these continuous statistical processes. Then p-values are generated via the Random Field Theory (which helps address the multiple comparisons problem by estimating the smoothness of the statistical map, which is then used to give the expected “Euler characteristic” at different thresholds), and peaks and clusters in the data are assessed as statistically significant or not. Since not everyone’s full signal data is captured in exact increments from point A to point B, typically we perform analyses around certain timing indicators (noted below in more detail cerca ‘FP’ or ‘Foot Plant’ and ‘BR’ or ‘Ball Release’) and the frames around them, to allow more robust comparisons.
Our first SPM blog addresses more specific applied connections between certain biomechanical values and their corresponding influence during a pitcher’s motion.
A few shorthand definitions and notes are here:
In this piece specifically, we looked at tall and short throwers and broke them down over three different controls:
For these comparisons, we also looked at a few clumped groups of biomechanical metrics, having identified these as metrics of interest in two sample T-test SPM analyses. As most of these clumped groups included anywhere from 3 to 8 different metrics, we applied an informal multiple comparisons adjustment and lowered the alpha level to 0.01.
The groups of biomechanical metrics we compared are:
Among the hard throwers, we have 17 tall throwers and 23 short throwers. The short throwers were 70.8 ± 1.4 inches tall while the tall throwers stood 76.6 ± 0.7 inches.
After running SPM analyses across our metrics of interests, these results were statistically significant (tall group=red line, short group=black line):
Tall Throwers had significantly greater shoulder external rotation around 15 to 20 frames before FP.
Tall Throwers had a significantly greater pelvis angle around 10 to 20 frames before FP.
Short Throwers had a significantly greater back hip flexion around 10 to 20 frames before FP.
Short Throwers had a significantly greater torso rotation angular velocity around 15 to 20 frames after FP.
Tall Throwers had a significantly greater COG velo around 15-20 frames before and after FP.
Among the tall throwers, we have 17 hard throwers and 6 soft throwers. The soft throwers sat 73.4 ± 4.2 mph, while the hard throwers were 90.5 ± 1.6 mph.
We found no statistically significant results here (likely in part because of the smaller samples on both ends of the cutoffs).
Among the short throwers, we have 25 hard throwers and 52 soft throwers. The soft throwers sat 69.3 ± 12.8 mph, while the hard throwers were 90.7 ± 1.8 mph.
These are the statistically significant comparisons centered around Foot Plant we found across this split (hard throwers=red line, soft throwers=black line):
Harder Throwers had a significantly greater front knee flexion angular velo around 0 to 20 frames after FP.
Those familiar with biomechanical signals probably get excited seeing the full signal plots above, but the rest who still have no idea how a few curvy lines have anything to do with the pitching delivery likely need a bit more explanation.
Tall hard-throwing athletes (6’4” and taller, 88+ velocity) in our dataset compared to shorter hard-throwing athletes (6’ and under, 88+ velocity) exhibited:
Now, when splitting along the shorter athletes only group, harder throwers (88+ mph) compared to softer (78- mph) throwers exhibited:
With higher peak torso rotational velocity, less back hip extension, and slower body movement toward the plate, shorter athletes may need to rotate faster and rely more on their lead leg block to achieve similar performance as their taller counterparts. This likely has to do with some of the more fundamental laws of physics that pertain to lever length and body mass. Taller athletes will often have more mass to move, and consequently, more kinetic energy per unit of rotational velocity. Further, rotational kinetic energy is something that we have seen to be related to performance. They also have longer body segments, allowing them to create the same amount of linear velocity with slower rotational velocities.
There are limitations associated with this analysis:
Limitations aside, tall versus short throwers and any other generalized throwing classifications are an attempt at profiling athletes better to prescribe more effective training and performance advice. It is unlikely any one of them is the end-all assessment insight. That doesn’t mean, however, that we should not try to share only what elite throwers do better than non-elite throwers, but also identify what different subsets of elite or near-elite throwers do uniquely to achieve high pitch velocities. With that, we can start piecing together the pitching puzzle (I swear that alliteration came naturally).
The flexibility of full signal allows us to recognize patterns and differences when comparing biomechanical full signals more comprehensively. We see this as an exciting opportunity to play around with dividing across different group distinctions—in this case, athlete height, as initially requested by past Driveline pitching trainer Daniel Moskos (now Pitching Coach for the New York Yankees Single-A affiliate team).
We hope you strap in and join us for the next SPM blog, this time with likely more data in our new pipeline, and about 2% more knowledge of SPM in our back pockets.
For similar investigations and discussion, tune in to the Driveline R&D podcast weekly, where we talk about research and development projects small and large.

Love the research you guys publish.  Where can I find basic diagrams demonstrating the biomechanical metrics from the first table?  For someone not well-versed, it would be great to have a resource that shows exactly what all the various abductions/adductions, flexions and internal and external rotations refer to.  Something like an expansion of the 3 diagrams from https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/07/caught-looking-articles-of-the-week-july-30/ would be really helpful.  Thanks
Dave – thanks for the kind words and question. Unfortunately we do not have a comprehensive easy to reference guide that details all those metrics, though if you Google “anatomical terms of motion” there are a number of resources (videos and articles) that detail what the various movements look like for different joints to help make sense of the terms.

Visual Approach: Pre-pitch Gaze Behavior of Baseball Hitters - Driveline Baseball,2020-07-27T03:46:13+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/07/visual-approach-pre-pitch-gaze-behavior-of-baseball-hitters/,"Hitting perception is often discussed in terms of ball flight tracking and reaction times. But something often ignored is the wealth of visual information available before the pitch is even released.
The position of the pitcher’s glove, the way he breaks his hands, and the posture of his midsection during the delivery are all examples of visual information that a hitter could use to prepare for the pitch.
That begs the question: what are hitters looking at when they are in the box? If you were to ask them, chances are they wouldn’t have an immediate answer.
After a little bit of thought, they may say, “I look at the pitcher’s glove,” or, “I watch their arm and where the ball is released.” There doesn’t seem to be a consensus on a visual approach among the hitters we have worked with in-gym.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
As far as approach goes, I generally subscribe to the idea that deliberately thinking about things like mechanics and where you’re looking decreases a hitter’s ability to react and perform in a competitive setting.
I do believe that being in the flow state is important, and shutting off outside thoughts when in a competitive setting provides an advantage. However, the training setting may be a good place to focus on improving visual strategies. I’ll touch on this later, but this is why I think it is useful to try to understand where hitters look and how we can use that knowledge to develop better hitters.
Rob Gray wrote a great piece laying out possible strategies to capture this pre-ball release information on his blog. He talked about four potential strategies and which ones seemed most realistic in light of previously published literature and neurological limitations.
Image from The Perception & Action Blog by Rob Gray
The two prevailing ideas were visual pivot point and soft-focus strategies. Without getting too far into this (really, read Rob’s post, it’s awesome), the visual pivot point strategy is when a hitter focuses on the pitcher’s throwing elbow or shoulder, so they don’t have to shift their focus. Soft focus is when a hitter collects information from a wide area instead of focusing on one specific spot.
Gray discusses another strategy that we have most frequently observed with our hitters in a live setting using gaze tracking. Let’s call it the saccadic strategy, or when hitters focus on the pitcher’s body during their windup and delivery but follow this with a fast shift of focus to the pitcher’s release point. Before I try to explain it more, take a look at this gif.
The shift in focus I am referring to happens around the time the pitcher’s front foot makes contact with the ground—you can see the hitter’s gaze position (the white dot and cross) shift upwards and to the left. I should mention that the eye movement doesn’t seem to be triggered by the pitcher’s front foot making contact with the ground, but rather those two events often coincidentally happen at the same time.
Train at Driveline
A saccade is a shift in gaze position when eyes move quickly from one fixation point to another. Saccades can be problematic for hitters. Multiple studies found that visual information is lost during a saccade, meaning we can’t recognize the movement of an object as well during one of these fast eye movements (Binda et al. 2018).
The loss of visual information is called saccadic suppression, and Satoshi et al. illustrated this well in the plot below. You can see that the percentage of correctly identified motion (y-axis) significantly decreased during the duration of the saccade (the horizontal line at the top of the plot).
If we are losing visual information during a saccade, we probably don’t want to make saccadic movements right before the ball is released from the pitcher’s hand. We may not be able to see as much information from ball release—the primary reason this strategy is not a theoretical front runner.
Graphic from Satoshi et al 1988
However, the existence of saccadic suppression is not the only evidence suggesting a saccade from the pitcher’s body to their hand right before ball release would be disadvantageous for the hitter. Gray also cites Kato et al., published in 2002, which compared the pre-pitch visual patterns of ordinary university students with those of collegiate baseball players.
They found that the members of the expert group (college athletes) were not only more consistent in where they looked, but also positioned their gaze closer to the throwing elbow than the pitcher’s body during the delivery.
Graphic from Kato et al. 2002
If you are conflicted about which strategy is the most commonly used among the competitive hitting population in light of controversial evidence, then you are not alone. I am too. The existence of saccadic suppression and some evidence supporting the use of a visual pivot point on the pitcher’s elbow might suggest that hitters would not benefit from moving their eyes just before a pitcher delivers the ball; however, other evidence suggests that experienced hitters could do exactly that.
First, despite the evidence that we lose visual information while we execute saccades, multiple studies have found that hitters use saccadic movements during ball flight in baseball and cricket hitting (Kishita et al. 2020, Mann et al. 2013). Kishita et al. found that big league hitters initiate this saccade later than minor league hitters, but they execute the movement nonetheless. Mann et al. found that cricket hitters also use saccades to anticipate the location of ball bounce and the location of bat-ball contact.
If saccades (or just fast eye movements) are being used while tracking the ball, it seems plausible that we also use them before the ball is released. To try to explain how it’s still possible to use a saccade during ball flight tracking, I jumped into some basic perception research.
As it turns out, saccadic “suppression” doesn’t necessarily mean all the information outside of our awareness is lost. The suppressed information can still be processed by the visual system (Watson et al. 2009). Watson et al. showed that despite participants being unaware of the visual stimulus presented during saccades in their experiment, the visual stimulus still affected their post-saccade perception. They call this saccadic omission.
It’s a little confusing—even though the participants were not consciously aware of a straight black line presented to them during their fast eye movement, it changed the perceived shape of an object displayed after the fast eye movement was over, even though the actual shape being displayed was always the same. As you can see in the figure below, the circle was perceived as an oval in a direction that is dependent on the direction of the straight line presented during a saccade.
Figure from Watson et al. 2009
This finding is far removed from applied baseball research. However, it provides some evidence that our visual system can still collect and process information during a saccade, despite the breadth of research outlining the suppression of visual ability during such eye movements. With that in mind, let’s take another look at the overwhelming evidence that our hitters use this saccadic strategy.
Here is a hitter executing the saccadic strategy in slow motion. You can see his gaze position (red dot and cross) moving upwards and outwards around the time of the pitcher’s front foot plant.
Similarly, the following gif shows a hitter facing a sidearm pitcher. This is interesting because the sidearm delivery is much less common than an over the top or three-quarters delivery, and we can see that hitters (or at least this hitter) still apply a saccadic strategy.
If you look very closely, you can see the hitter’s gaze position shift twice. It’s unknown whether the second saccade was to correct the location of the first saccade or if that is the hitter’s common solution to facing a sidearm slot.
Next, here is another example from one of the most accomplished hitters we have had in the gym.
This pattern emerges in nearly all data we collect with acceptable calibrations, from amateur to professional hitters. Although our dataset is still limited in terms of sample size, it is becoming increasingly clear this is a viable pre-pitch strategy. Additionally, if we factor in the 2002 study from Kato et al., the difference in hitters’ gaze positions at the end of phase 1 and 3 can also be interpreted as support for the use of saccades.
If we take another look at that 2002 study, we can see there is a clear difference in hitter’s gaze position between the pitcher’s windup (left photo below) and at the time of ball release (right photo below). Eye movement from the pitcher’s body to the visual pivot point has to happen between these two phases in the pitcher’s delivery.
Since they did not report the transition of gaze position between phases, we can’t be sure if these hitters used a saccade to move their gaze from the pitcher’s body to the elbow. Still, it seems reasonable to assume they deployed a similar strategy to what we see here at Driveline.
Images from Kato et al. 2002
Despite some limitations in our current dataset and the consequent analyses, we can be confident that many hitters use a strategy involving a saccadic shift from a focal point on the pitcher’s body to somewhere closer to the release point of the pitch.
This is supported by the gaze tracking data we have collected thus far, a saccadic suppression revisit, and a slight reframing of the interpretation of a study long supporting the use of a visual pivot point. The destination of this saccadic movement—whether the pitcher’s throwing elbow or hand at release point—is unclear, but our current dataset suggests it is closer to the hand than the elbow.
We are some time away from being able to fully apply this knowledge and its many nuances, but there are some takeaways that we can use to potentially improve training systems.
If we know that hitters’ eyes are not stationary while they prepare for the pitch in a live setting, and we know that they move their eyes from a position on the pitcher’s body to a position on the pitcher’s arm at the time of ball release, we can create machine batting practice environments that more closely represent facing a real pitcher.
This idea has already talked about—teams across baseball have hired pitchers to throw game-like batting practice—but our data provides even more support for this type of training. More exposure to game-like, live arms can help improve hitters’ ability to predict the location of ball release, in turn improving their ‘internal model’ for recognizing trends and predicting pitch characteristics.
This is becoming a thing. At least one MLB team carries 1+ ex-pro live BP arms on their staff.
I feel like I should defer to @bruinmcmillan who has a tremendous story about Barry Bonds, competitive batting practice, and when he saw something different at UCLA. Enjoy. https://t.co/dgHPiOoHl9 pic.twitter.com/XlOEdE2fsQ
— Kyle Boddy (@drivelinebases) April 5, 2020
Short box and mixed pitch batting practice (rather than fastball-only batting practice) are two additional ways we can better replicate a game-like environment in the training setting. We implement short box in-gym every week, which has been a good way to provide competition for athletes in the training setting and work on their approach against unknown pitch sequences. It also has the benefit of replicating the perception of a live arm better than some other batting practice modalities.
Ideas 1 and 2 warrant additional investigations to optimize training methods, but given the current state of hitting vision training and research, all three of these ideas are pretty safe bets to improve batting practice if you were to begin implementation.
Given the research into the time it takes for a swing/no-swing decision, and the time it takes to swing the bat, much of the swing decision may happen before the ball is in flight. In this case, we can begin to identify those specific cues on the pitcher’s body and in their movement, which provide the most information for accurate decision making and ball flight prediction—not to mention the doors that open when we begin to quantify hitters’ gaze behaviors.
Upon the development of valid quantitative gaze tracking metrics, we can begin to quantitatively compare visual strategies between different hitters and different conditions. For example, we could analyze visual strategies of different groups of hitters (e.g. professionals vs. amateurs) and/or different conditions (e.g. machine batting practice vs. short box vs. live batting practice).
The following plot is an early example—we used our gaze tracking system to compare hitters’ visual strategies in short-box with their visual strategies against live pitchers. We compared the magnitude of their saccadic shift (from the pitcher’s body to their arm) against a live pitcher at 60 feet 6 inches and a live pitcher in short-box (about 50 feet). We found that they are highly correlated within each athlete. This provides more support for the use of short-box as a training tool for hitters by showing how similar a hitter’s visual strategy is between live and short box environments.
Warning: Small sample size
As we begin to create more quantitative measurements, we can validate them by investigating how they relate to actual hitting performance.
Do better hitters also perform better in our chosen metrics? If not, we need to rethink what or how we measure gaze behavior. Do our metrics correlate with higher xwOBA or other in-game performance statistics? The results of these validations are going to be the most powerful. They will allow us to take another step forward in beating pitchers in this game that is increasingly dominated by powerful pitch arsenals.

Why Driveline got a Biodex - Driveline Baseball,2020-07-15T04:00:46+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/07/why-driveline-got-a-biodex/,"If this is the first time seeing this video, it probably leaves you with a handful of unanswered questions:
In this blog, we will answer those questions one at a time.
The machine above is a Biodex System 2 Isokinetic Dynamometer.
More specifically, the Biodex allows us to isolate/assess individual joints. By isolating various joints,  we can identify where a player is weakest and what movements specifically might be contributing to those weaknesses. Within each test, we can track the following (plus much more):
To gather more information regarding various metrics and their role in elbow pain, we constructed an apparatus to measure the isometric strength of multiple movements. We measured isometric wrist flexion/extension and isometric shoulder er/ir, in addition to standard grip strength.
We constructed our apparatus using a Camry Digital Hand Dynamometer Grip Strength Measurement Meter and mule tape. This device worked pretty well for the first few weeks. As we collected more tests, however, we began to question the reliability of our device—we were getting significantly different measurements between reps, and it was difficult to distinguish the correct from incorrect.
We knew that we wanted/needed to continue to explore the role of wrist, forearm, and shoulder strength in baseball-specific activity, but needed a new method.
In the process of searching for other methods with which to develop a strength profile for the wrist and forearm, we came across an article titled Isokinetic profile of wrist and forearm strength in elite female junior tennis players (Ellenbecker et. al, 2006). This article discussed the differences in wrist and forearm strength between dominant and non-dominant arms in tennis players. Their study found that wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation strength were significantly greater on the dominant arm.
The ability to objectively measure the strength of these muscle groups in an isolated manner was of considerable interest to us, as they are the primary muscles shown to reduce loading on the UCL.
Luckily, we were able to meet up with the lead author of the study, Dr. Todd Ellenbecker, in Scottsdale, AZ, to chat and get firsthand experience with the machine. While Dr. Ellenbecker primarily focuses on research involving tennis players, we were able to pick his brain and discuss how this type of testing could apply to baseball pitchers.
After seeing the machine firsthand, we were further sold on this idea and underwent a month-long quest for a Biodex system of our own. While we explored multiple options—even venturing as far as Miami—we ultimately were able to find a Biodex system not too far away in Kennewick, WA, which now resides at the Driveline facility.
By acquiring a Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer, our primary goal is to further evaluate the role that forearm, wrist, and shoulder strength may play in the health of baseball pitchers. In addition, we can objectively assess various joints/movements and make comparisons to motion capture data gathered at our in-house biomechanics lab.
Since acquiring this machine, each athlete who has thrown in the biomechanics lab at Driveline has also undergone a Biodex assessment. This assessment consisted of:
While the four tests above serve as the first iteration of our Biodex protocol, they are certainly not the limit for what we can/will be able to do with this machine. With the above data alone we can:
In the future, we expect to have the ability to:
This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we can evaluate and learn now that we have the Biodex at Driveline.
Such additions will allow Driveline to continue to push the state of research in baseball forward as a whole and will open new avenues for assessment/training protocols.

What is WAR in Baseball? An Introduction to College WAR - Driveline Baseball,2020-06-10T21:39:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/06/an-introduction-to-cwar/,"The cWAR dashboard has not been updated after the 2021 season.
Wins Above Replacement Level, or WAR, is nothing more than a framework that attempts to summarize the entirety of a player’s contribution (fielding, baserunning, batting, or pitching) in one catch-all number. Certainly, like all metrics, baseball WAR is not perfect and it has its limitations depending upon whom you ask and what iteration you’re using. However, whatever your opinion is on the matter, it’s undeniable that in the year 2020, WAR in baseball has helped change the game forever.
In the past 2-3 years alone, WAR has influenced MVP and Cy Young races, helped sports writers rank and organize free agent lists, given fans a platform to evaluate the open market, and allowed analysts to determine how much a single draft selection is worth in present-day dollars.
In this sense, although WAR is just a framework by design, it functions as much more than that for those around the game. For us, baseball WAR is a gateway to better analyses, better evaluations, and better comprehension of the sport itself.
Given the importance of WAR at the MLB level, we felt it was time to expand the same principles and methods to the college realm, as, to the best of our knowledge, calculations of NCAA WAR have not been attempted by any prior public analyst or organization.
(The visualization above shows the odds of making the NCAA tournament based on the cumulative WAR produced by each team from 2017-2019. The target threshold for D1 teams should be ~35-40 WAR per year.)
We model our WAR for NCAA D1 players after Fangraphs WAR baseball calculations. On the hitting side, we use park-adjusted, as well as strength of schedule-adjusted (SOS), wOBA, estimated base-running runs (BsR estimate), estimated fielding runs (UZR estimate), and a positional adjustment for comparing different positions. On the pitching side, our WAR is based on FIP rather than RA9, following Fangraphs’ methodology.
Given the limitations of the metrics found on the NCAA’s website, we were able to calculate Pitcher WAR from 2013-2020 and Position Player WAR for those who cleared the requisite playing time threshold from 2017-2020.
In this blog, we will detail the steps involved in our calculations (based on Fangraphs’s methods detailed here for position players and here for pitchers), and then address the limitations of our version of WAR.
WAR = (Batting Runs Above Replacement + Positional Adjustment + Base-Running Runs + Fielding Runs ) / (Runs Per Win)
With position player WAR in baseball, perhaps the most burdensome limitation in our dataset was the lack of detailed fielding positions at the NCAA level. These are difficult to obtain yet necessary for applying positional adjustments and estimating defensive runs saved. Thus, we only have baseball WAR for position players from 2017 onward, as we were fortunate to obtain positions for the vast majority of players with significant playing time (> 150 ABs) across these years via D1Baseball’s stats page.
To determine a player’s offensive value, we first calculate wOBA for each player, which is derived using NCAA D1 year-specific wOBA coefficients (available on our GUTS page). Given the large amount of variability in offensive environments and strength of schedule across D1 teams, we control for seasonal context by adjusting wOBA using park factors and SOS adjustments via mixed models.
Once we have Replacement Level defined (see below), we calculate wOBA above replacement, then convert wOBA Above Replacement to Runs/PA above Replacement, and multiply by PA’s to get Batting Runs above Replacement Level.
(Leaders in cumulative position player WAR from 2017-2019.)
Defining replacement level is less straightforward at the collegiate level, as the talent level of non-scholarship athletes / bench players will vary widely across D1 schools. Thus, any specific attempt to define replacement level by looking at the performance of bench players may not reflect a talent level readily available to all schools.
With that constraint in mind, we approached calculating replacement level from a couple avenues. First, we looked at the estimated run differentials of the worst performing D1 college baseball teams over the past 8 seasons relative to D1 average.
We then assumed that 1/2 of their well-below average run differential was attributed to replacement level hitting, giving us a platform to calculate how many runs per plate appearance below average a replacement level D1 team/player produces at the plate.
When Replacement Level Runs Per Plate Appearance is converted to wOBA using the wOBA scale, it produces a similar wOBA output to the subset of players with less than 10 games played during a given season. Thus, we define offensive replacement level as the average production level of players with 0-10 games played in that year.
Note, given the shortened season in 2020, we used the 2019 value for offensive replacement level for 2020.
Without reliable defensive metrics at our disposal, our positional adjustments were based on the relative average wOBA by position, with an additional ad-hoc adjustment to recognize the value provided by playing a premium position. The values we used are below:
Adjustments per 250 PA’s
SS/C: + 3 runs
2B/3B/CF: +1.5 runs
LF/RF: -1.5 runs
1B/DH: -3 runs
Fangraphs uses their comprehensive base-running statistic BsR in their baseball WAR calculation. However, given a lack of baserunning data at the NCAA level, we instead approximate this value by building a model on MLB data to predict BsR per Game using terms from Bill James’s speed score. We then scale these estimates up to the number of the games played for each athlete.
As with base-running, we are not able to precisely calculate fielding runs (UZR) at the level of detail used for MLB WAR calculations. As a workaround, we instead approximate UZR using the defensive statistics we have available (i.e. put outs, assists and errors). Given vast differences in positional demands, we built separate models for each position and added some safeguards to correct for a large amount of uncertainty with our values.
We convert Runs to Wins using the same methodology as Fangraphs, which was developed by Tom Tango as a simplified version of the Pythagpat formula listed below:
Runs Per Win = 9*(NCAA D1 Runs Scored / NCAA D1 Innings Pitched)*1.5 + 3
In calculating this runs per win value for each season, we find that a win equates to roughly 11-12 runs at the D1 level. We then use this conversion rate to translate Runs above Replacement Level to Wins above Replacement level.
As referenced above, we base our Pitching WAR off of FIP rather than RA9 to better control for the greater variance in park factor and defensive talent that occurs across the D1 level. While the process for pitching WAR encompasses fewer individual components than position player WAR, there are still several steps to go through to calculate it.
WAR = ((Avg FIP – Pitcher FIP)/Dynamic Runs Per Wins + Wins Between Avg and Replacement Level per Nine) * IP/9
Fangraphs starts by adjusting FIP to include IFFBs as Strikeouts, but we, unfortunately, do not have IFFB% by pitcher available to us. Thus, we proceed with standard FIP as the basis of our WAR values (the FIP constants by year can be found on our GUTS page).
To translate FIP into units of runs and eventually wins, we need to first convert our FIP metric to be on the same scale as RA9. We accomplish this by adding a scaling adjustment of .92 to each pitcher’s FIP.
(Leaders in cumulative pitcher WAR from 2017-2019.)
Similar to Position Player WAR, we want Pitcher WAR to be independent of Park Factor and Strength of Schedule, so we control for both using the same multiplicative park and SOS adjustment factors as above. Note that since we are adjusting FIP and not RA9 or ERA, park factor will be regressed heavily to avoid overfitting on a metric that does not consider non-HR BIPs.
Now that we have a park and SOS-adjusted metric on a runs per game scale, we can calculate Runs Above Avg Per 9. To compare each player’s numbers to league average, we repeat the steps above for  league average FIP and subtract each pitcher’s RA9 scale-adjusted FIP to this league average value to get Runs Above Avg Per 9.
While we were able to apply a flat Runs per Win conversion factor for all hitters in a given year, pitchers need to be treated differently given that they significantly influence the number of runs required to win a specific game. As a result, we calculated a specific adjustment to the Runs to Wins conversion factor. For this dynamic runs per win factor, we mirror what Fangraphs uses in their formula:
Dynamic Runs/Inning = [(IP/G)*pitcher’s FIPR9 + (18 – IP/G)*Average FIPR9 ] / 18
The first term in the numerator corresponds to a pitcher’s average number of runs allowed per appearance, while the second term corresponds to the number of runs an average pitching staff would allow in the remainder of the 18 total innings in a game (2*9) that the given pitcher did not pitch.
After calculating the formula above, we convert this dynamic number of runs/inning to output Runs Above Avg Per Nine and subsequently Wins Per Game Above Average.
Our threshold of Replacement Level, described in the position player WAR section above, is used again for pitcher WAR. However, since position players also contribute to run prevention with their performances in the field, only 43% of the total WAR at the NCAA level per season is given to Pitchers (the same split used across all MLB WAR metrics).
Additionally, since Starters are tasked with longer appearances as well as a larger “times through the order penalty” relative to relievers, we needed to find a more relaxed replacement level to account for the additional challenges they face. To accomplish this, we scale Fangraphs’s replacement level adjustments for Starters and Relievers (0.380 and 0.470 Win percentages respectively) to our NCAA combined pitching replacement level to get Starter/Reliever specific NCAA replacement levels.
These NCAA replacement levels are then translated to Wins Per Game Above Replacement and applied to every pitcher in the dataset based on their proportion of appearances as a starter or reliever.
Now that we have a rate statistic for Wins Above Replacement per game, we convert this metric to a cumulative value by multiplying by IP/9. This gets us the total number of Wins that a player contributed above replacement level throughout the year.
To ensure that we still observe a 57/43 split in WAR amongst position players and pitchers, we apply a small per-inning or per-PA adjustment to the pitching and hitting WAR figures we’ve calculated.
While we have made our best efforts to incorporate as much data as possible, the available collegiate data is not as detailed as MLB data.
On the position player side, the main limitations we faced involved calculating Base-Running Runs and Fielding Runs. As detailed above, we do not have direct measurements of these metrics, so we instead approximate and regress as accurately as we can.
While our methods provide decent proxies for both stats, they inevitably miss the finer details that advanced metrics (BsR and UZR) are able to account for. As such, any precise estimates of an individual player’s zone rating / BsR is quite a far stretch and regressed heavily in our calculations.
(WAR aging curves at the NCAA level. Improvement in performance is expected each subsequent year in college, with the largest gains occurring from Freshman to Sophomore year)
Our fielding runs model is also dependent upon the position labels we have available. In certain instances, we have found those labels to be incorrect or incomplete. We remove some of the obvious outliers (outfielders with 100 assists, who presumably played in the infield as well), but less conspicuous cases may be included.
Athletes who played multiple positions (especially completely different positions) will throw off our fielding runs model. To control for this uncertainty, we significantly down-weight these fielding runs in our total WAR. Thus, premium defenders will receive less credit than is deserved because of this safeguard.
On the pitching side, the two limitations we face are not adjusting FIP to reward pitchers for Infield Flies, and not adjusting for pitcher leverage. Thus, pitchers with a disproportionate number of infield fly outs and relievers who consistently produce results in high-leverage situations will not receive the full credit that they would receive in MLB-level WAR.
With all of those caveats in mind, we hope that you see as much value in developing WAR at the NCAA level (cWAR) as we do. Like all iterations of WAR, cWAR has its shortcomings, limitations, and potential biases that we won’t shy away from. However, to our knowledge, it also serves as the first stand-alone, park, and SOS adjusted metric that attempts to measure NCAA performance in a scalable manner across all conferences.
That alone will help advance the college game and provide the industry with something we have all wanted for a very long time. We hope you enjoy the dashboard and please let us know any thoughts or feedback you might have.
Great article, I have a quick question however: How does Adley Rutschman have a higher wRC than plate appearances? That doesn’t seem to make much sense to me, many of the players have very high wRC. Does your WAR use wRC+ instead?
Thanks for the kind words. The wRC. listed in the Dashboard is for wRC+ rather than wRC, the ‘+’ character was replaced by a ‘.’ hence the confusion. The batting runs component of our WAR was calculated using the wOBA values from that Dashboard, we just include wRC+ as another related metric of potential interest in the table.

Using PULSE to define throwing workload | Driveline Baseball,2020-04-24T02:45:59+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/04/what-is-throwing-workload/,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of usage and data collection, PULSE was known as Motus. We will be referring to it as PULSE throughout this blog.
The foundational concept behind the use of the PULSE sensor is “workload”—but what exactly does workload refer to?
In a general sense, workload describes the stress from each throw an athlete makes. So, does that mean that workload is just a measure of the number of throws an athlete makes in a given game? Not quite.
What typical in-game pitch counts fail to account for is the varying workloads between game days, as well as the variance in pregame workloads between athletes. For example, let’s evaluate two hypothetical athletes:
Player A
Long tosses out to 300 feet
Throws a 30 pitch pregame bullpen
Throws 85 pitches in the game
Player B
Long tosses out to 150 feet
Throws a 20 pitch pregame bullpen
Throws 85 pitches in the game
Using pitch counts, these athletes would be considered to have the same workload; however, we can see that they make a drastically different number of throws.
Okay, you may be thinking, so we should just track the total number of throws athletes make each day? Not quite.
Counting the total number of throws each day would certainly be better than just pitch counts in-game. Unfortunately, this method would still fail to account for the varying intensities between various throws. Is a throw at 100% intensity on the mound worth the same as a 50% intensity throw at the beginning of catch play?
With the use of the PULSEthrow sensor, we are able to measure the amount of valgus torque placed on the elbow with each throw. These values have also been validated against data generated at our in-house biomechanics lab at Driveline.
A throw with a stress value of 60 Nm will have a much different impact on a 16-year-old high school kid who is 6-foot and weighs 150 pounds, than on a 28-year-old professional pitcher who is 6-foot, 200 pounds. To take this into account, each throw is normalized for the given athlete’s height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).
Various loads have different impacts on our bodies over time. A squat of 400 pounds is going to leave me sorer than if I just squatted 200 pounds twice. In throwing, this would be equivalent to me throwing a ball with a peak elbow valgus torque of 100 Nm in comparison to two throws with a peak valgus torque of 50 Nm.
Research by NASA into the effect of exercise on bone loading and its impact on “Daily Load Stimulus” has shown us that the stimulus from exercise is not linear with the load placed upon the body. However, this research provided us with an exponential weight to apply to the load of each throw. Below is the resulting One Throw Workload formula.
The above formula tells us that to find the workload units for an individual throw we:
We are left with the workload units for each individual throw. Now let’s compare the workloads of two different throws again. We will assume this athlete is 6 feet tall (1.8288 meters) and weighs 200 pounds (90.7185 meters).
Whereas before the 100 Nm throw was considered to have simply two times the workload as the 50 Nm throw, the 100 Nm throw now equates to roughly 2.45 throws at 50 Nm.
Within the PULSEthrow app and PULSEdash, certain throws are tagged as “high effort” throws. This designation is not meant to be good or bad but is simply used to provide further insight into your throwing habits each day. To begin, the elbow valgus torque from all throws in the past two weeks that were not simulated, weighted balls, or outliers are summed. In other words, the number of throws with a 5-ounce baseball were measured in real-time over the past two weeks.
IF there are greater than 50 throws remaining:
IF there are less than 50 throws remaining:
As we touched on previously, each throw in a given day is not performed at the same intensity. An athlete’s first throw of the day playing catch is likely not going to be as stressful as their first pitch in the game. To find the workload units within each day, we find the sum total of all one throw workloads within that given day. We title this metric One Day Workload.
The above formula tells us that to find the workload units for a given day we:
The resulting one day workload gives us better insight into how each day’s throwing is impacting the athlete. While making more throws in a given day will accumulate workload within that day, throw count is not necessarily indicative of workload. Different throw counts can result in the same one day workload and the same one day workload can be reached with a number of different throw counts.
Why is one day workload of importance? By calculating the workload units from a given day, we can also evaluate trends in an athlete’s workload over time—both recently and over longer periods of time. With PULSEthrow, we are able to find each athlete’s Acute Workload and Chronic Workload. Acute workload refers to the average one day workload for a given athlete over the previous nine days, whereas chronic workload refers to the average one day workload for the last 28 days.
The condition of your arm is not simply impacted by the workload from that given day but is also impacted by the previous days you’ve thrown.  If we simply took the average for the previous nine days, each day within those nine days would hold the same weight. Realistically, throwing today is going to have a larger impact on your throwing tomorrow than your throwing from eight days ago. To factor for this, PULSEthrow uses a weighted moving average for each one day workload when calculating an athlete’s acute workload. This is accomplished by the use of “Acute Kernels,” in which the workload from the most recent day is multiplied by 1.3, and workloads from previous days are multiplied by lower values, such that eight days prior is multiplied by 0.7.
Once we have determined the weight of each one day workload and found the corresponding values, we must then sum these values. After summing these values, the total must be divided by a number of days, “N,” to find the weighted average one day workload. Typically, N would equal nine since that is the number of days we are evaluating; however, during the first two weeks of assessing acute workload, we use a “dynamic divisor” in its place to make the values more usable. The dynamic divisor, in this case, ranges from three to nine days. On the first day N=3, and on each subsequent day, N increases by one until reaching 9 on day 7 where it will remain. This results in the following equation for acute workload during the first two weeks:
The above equation tells us that to find the workload units for acute workload we:
We are left with the value for the weighted average workload units for the past nine days, acute workload within the first two weeks for an athlete. After the first two weeks, we are able to use a static divisor, 9. The corresponding equation is used for acute workload following the first two weeks:
The above equation mirrors the equation used during the first two weeks for Steps 1, 2, and 3. Once the sum of the weighted one day workloads is found, it is divided by 9 each day, rather than ranging from 3 to 9.
Acute workload can be used to tell us about an athlete’s throwing habits in the short term. When used in conjunction with chronic workload, these measures can help us to evaluate how similar or different these workloads are over time.
Before we can compare acute and chronic workloads, we must first calculate chronic workload. Previously we mentioned that chronic workload describes an athlete’s past 28 days of throwing. Unlike acute workload, chronic workload is not a weighted average but a rolling average of one day workloads over the past 28 days. Similar to acute workload, we initially use a dynamic divisor for chronic workload to make the values more usable. The dynamic divisor for chronic workload ranges from 5 to 28 days and is used for the first 24 days before the use of a static chronic divisor. The following equation is used for chronic workload during the first 24 days:
The above equation tells us that to find the workload units for chronic workload we:
…
…
The result is the value for chronic workload. Past the first 24 days, we are able to use a static chronic divisor, 28. The corresponding equation is used for chronic workload moving forward…
The above equation mirrors the equation used during the first two weeks for Steps 1 and 2. Once the sum of the one day workloads is found, it is divided by 28 each day, rather than ranging from 5 to 28.
Chronic workload tells us about an athlete’s throwing habits in the long term and can be considered a measure of general throwing fitness. Again, when used in conjunction with acute workload, these measures can help us to evaluate how similar or different these workloads are over time. Higher levels of chronic workload have been associated with decreased risk of injury and also allow for greater amounts of acute and one day workload without increasing acute to chronic ratio—which we will discuss next.
The last metric we will discuss is acute to chronic workload ratio. Acute to chronic ratio tells us how similar an athlete’s workload over the previous nine days is in comparison to their workload over the previous 28 days. This ratio is found using the following equation:
An acute to chronic ratio of 1.0 would mean that the athlete’s average one day workload during those two spans was identical. An acute to chronic ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the athlete’s current throwing workload is higher than it has been previously. Lastly, an acute to chronic ratio less than 1.0 indicates the athlete’s throwing workload is less than it has been previously.
To increase an athlete’s chronic workload, the athlete must have an acute to chronic ratio greater than 1. Previous research has shown us that once acute to chronic ratios get too high athletes tend to show an increased risk of injury. The result of this research was that acute to chronic ratios in baseball athletes higher than 1.3 resulted in their being more likely to sustain an upper-body injury.
An acute to chronic ratio of 1.3 would indicate a 30% increase in the average one day workload over the most recent nine days in comparison to the previous 28 days. This is important to note, as athletes, pitchers especially, build up throwing volume and intensity in preparation for their seasons.
While we must have an acute to chronic ratio higher than 1 in order to increase an athlete’s chronic workload, we must not increase this workload too quickly or else risk significantly increasing their risk for injury. This is not to say that maintaining an acute to chronic ratio under 1.3 reduces the risk of injury completely, but it does seem to help.
On the flip side, having an acute to chronic ratio that is too low can also be detrimental. The suggested range for acute to chronic ratio is therefore 0.7 to 1.3.
By using PULSEthrow and PULSEdash, we are able to better understand the impact various throwing workloads have on baseball athletes. We can objectively measure the amount of elbow valgus torque generated during each throw and then assign the throw a value based upon the athlete’s height and weight. From this one throw workload value, we can determine one day workloads for various throw counts and intensities.
These one day workload values are then transformed into acute and chronic workloads that tell us about an athlete’s throwing workload in both the short term and long term. These acute and chronic workloads allow us to determine the acute to chronic workload ratio for the given athlete—which has been shown to signal an increase in the risk of potential injury.
Traditional thought may be that workload is measured as a means to reduce the amount a pitcher throws. In reality, if monitored and progressed appropriately, objectively measuring pitchers’ workloads could allow us to have pitchers handle larger workloads more safely.

The Importance of Reading Journal Articles Critically,2020-04-09T01:34:31+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/04/the-importance-of-reading-journal-articles-critically/,"Recently, an article published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine used a novel study design and experiment to look at lighter weighted baseball training and its relation to velocity and injury risk. I have contentions with a few of the arguments made and how the information was presented.
I figured this would be an excellent opportunity to write a research article review of the paper. While writing, the review turned into a broader discussion of baseball research and the importance of reading articles critically. Here is the citation of the article I will discuss for those interested in following along.
Citations:
Erickson, B. J., Atlee, T. R., Chalmers, P. N., Bassora, R., Inzerillo, C., Beharrie, A., & Romeo, A. A. (2020). Training With Lighter Baseballs Increases Velocity Without Increasing the Injury Risk. Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine. https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967120910503
Before we begin, I think it’s important to cover some general thoughts on peer-review and research article reviews for those that might be unfamiliar. Such an intro might also avoid the potential of some of my points being misconstrued.
Peer reviews and critiques are a vital part of the scientific method and research in general. If you don’t have a background in this practice, it may come across as rude or combative to disagree with what someone has written.
*Looks over at the hyper-defensive baseball development Twitter world*
It’s easy to be defensive when someone provides a counterpoint to your work. But in the world of science and research, it is not only encouraged and embraced but is a fundamental aspect of the process. There was a recent thread on Twitter from Carl T. Bergstrom, a professor of Biology at UW, that I believe put it best. Updating your models or research based on counterpoints from colleagues isn’t a sign of weakness—it’s literally “doing science.”
https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1243258502023229440?s=20
It is a separate thread topically, but I think it’s a great primer to my review of this article and represents a general perspective shift that the entire baseball community would benefit from.
Research reviews are written based on the writer’s interpretation of the paper and their understanding of the science surrounding it. The aim is to approach the original research objectively, but at the end of the day, we all have our biases and beliefs based on what we think we know within the field and the context of the argument. My disagreements/agreements can only come from my perspective, which is most likely different than the authors’. This highlights the importance of reading things critically and developing your own opinions about the information provided.
Last point on research reviews: The goal is to help the reader of this review understand the paper without having to read it themselves. It’s easy to pick up a paper and just run with the title and what’s written in the abstract. There is always a lot more to it than that, however. We’ll get into the specific methodology of the study in question and some concerns I have with it as we go, but, in general, as a reader of scientific literature, you should not merely take the abstract and title at face value.
I also want to preface the following review by saying that, although I have some critiques, I very much appreciate the work that went into this piece.
Research like this is not easy; it takes an unbelievable amount of time and work that most people don’t appreciate. The methodology was a novel way to go about it, and the documentation of that methodology and design was incredible. The authors made it easy as a researcher to understand and examine the way they went about things, which is also essential for future studies and the ability to replicate the original later on—another critical aspect of science!
With that, let’s get into it.
The title of this paper is a great place to start because it’s most likely the first thing that you read and the easiest place to get misled:
“Training with Lighter Baseball Increases Velocity Without Increasing the Injury Risk”
When I first read it, I immediately thought, “Wow, that’s a big claim,” and in my opinion, it’s a pretty misleading title for the general public. In general, I don’t have a problem with including some aspect of the results in the title, but I prefer that it describe the purpose of the study and what they researched within the paper. Usually, this drives people to read it themselves and formulate their own opinion on the topic. In the age of rapid information consumption, a title like this could easily mislead the public. A title that doesn’t do that would be something along the lines of:
“The Effects of Lighter Baseballs on Velocity and Injury Risk”
Not nearly as exciting, but far less misleading. Science and research should aim to help inform the community and provide knowledge on various subjects. When you simplify the title of an article to a claim like this, it seems far too easy to mislead the general public on the topic, especially if they don’t have a background in science and research. It’s exacerbated by how the baseball community generally consumes information through mediums like Twitter. If you’re scrolling through your timeline, as I’m sure many of you were when you came across this article, it’s easy to not read everything involved in the study and walk away thinking something along the lines of “welp, I guess lighter baseballs increase velocity and don’t increase injury at all.”

What the title really says is: “In the context of this study, and given the research parameters that were employed, training with lighter baseballs, among other things, seems to have increased velocity without increasing injury risk.” That is very different than the blanket statement:
Lighter baseballs = more velocity and no injuries.
Alright, so let’s get into the study—the study design, the purpose/hypothesis, methods, etc.
“The purpose of this study was to determine whether a training program utilizing lighter baseballs could increase fastball velocity without increasing the injury risk to participants. We hypothesized that a training program with lighter baseballs would increase fastball velocity but not increase the injury risk.”
This is great and right in line with what you’d expect from baseball research right now: aiming to test and identify training modalities and programs that improve velocity while also evaluating their risk (potential for causing injury). I think this paper established its purpose well.
As a general commentary on the baseball research world and academia, it appears that there is this idea that when looking at training modalities and their relation to performance, velocity and injury risk are separate. When we talk about mechanics and training methods, we typically stay focused on velocity because it’s immediately tangible and measurable. Those in academia will sometimes not address velocity and focus solely on injury risk, stress, etc. I believe that to be a significant pitfall of other studies.
In my mind, velocity and injury risk both fall under performance when it comes to pitching. If you don’t throw hard, you’re going to have a harder time performing well, and if you’re injured, you’re not performing at all. So, any research or study that only looks at one or treats them independently fails the athlete. If we exclusively focused on research that reduced the risk of injury, we’d eventually conclude that the safest way to train and throw is to not throw at all. That is why I appreciate the purpose statement of this paper because it states that the researchers are looking at velocity and injury risk simultaneously.
How did they test that hypothesis? From the abstract:
One of the best parts of this study was how well they documented and outlined the phases and twenty-five training sessions that the pitchers went through during this program. There are detailed appendices detailing the exercises and workouts that the players performed throughout the study.
It’s important to note that in the Methods section, the authors explain that “weighted (heavier) balls were not used.” This is true for the baseball throwing portion of the workouts; no one used anything heavier than a 5 oz baseball. However, in the first and second phases of the fifteen-week program, there was a “velocity program medicine ball routine” that consisted of “light medicine ball routines” and “heavy medicine ball routines”.
Here is a description of the light medicine ball routine: “This routine uses 2- and 4-lb medicine balls to execute ‘over-the-head’ throws with both arms.” The rest of the appendix goes on to detail the various light medicine ball drills that were used, consisting of a variety of constrained two-handed throws. Now, technically the author’s original statement that heavier balls were not used is still true—no one used anything heavier than a 5 oz baseball during the throwing workout—but heavier balls in the form of 2 and 4 lb medicine balls were still thrown, albeit with two hands.
This brings up my biggest contention with the methodology in this paper: there was no control group. On top of that, there were a variety of training methodologies that the pitchers went through during this fifteen-week program:
Another word for these exercises would be extraneous variables; in other words, any additional variable that was not accounted for that could affect the results of the experiment. In research, typically you are investigating the possible effect of an independent variable (in this case, lightweight baseball training) on the dependent variables (velocity and injury risk). To scientifically test and investigate this, you typically perform a controlled study where you compare two groups, and the primary difference between groups is the independent variable. This research article did not run a controlled study with a control group. The authors address this in their limitations:
“This study did not have a control group of pitchers who used weighted balls, as we do not believe that these programs should be used based on current evidence showing significant increases in injury rates for players.”
We could write another full blog unpacking that statement alone—and we already have! The current evidence for significant injury risk that they cited is Reinold et al. 2018. OC discussed that study in this blog with a look at Long Term Weighted Ball Research in 2018.
Regardless of that, this study had no control group of pitchers using weighted balls. Going even one step further, I would like to have seen a control group that just did not use the lighter weighted baseballs. If the contention is that you did not believe weighted baseball training was safe for the subjects in the study, a simple solution would have been to split the group in half and have one group follow the lighter baseball training program and the other group perform the training program minus the lighter baseballs.
That is how you could have scientifically proven that lighter baseballs were the reason that they gained velocity and did not get injured. Because they did not do that, I believe it’s scientifically impossible and unfair to make the claim that they made in the results and the conclusion, attributing velocity and reduction of injury risk to the lighter baseballs. Changes in velocity and reduction of injury risk could have been attributed to any of the extraneous variables above.
I’m getting ahead of myself a bit here, so let’s tackle the results and discussion specifically, where I have some other contentions with the paper.
First, four players were excluded from analysis, one due to no baseline velocity data, another who did not complete the program due to a broken ankle suffered while playing basketball at home, and a third because he moved before the completion of the program. These are three very reasonable criteria for not including their data in the analysis. However, the fourth player that wasn’t included in the study “experienced biceps tendon soreness after participating in back-to-back showcases before the training program was completed against recommendations.”
This is where I have a problem. To me, this does not meet the criteria for exclusion and very closely borders the line of suppressing evidence and cherry-picking data. This is a form of confirmation bias where one ignores a critical data point because it does not confirm their hypothesis. At the very least, I’m glad that the authors mentioned why they excluded that data point.

I’d be willing to let it slide if there were additional commentary about how every other subject did not participate in “back-to-back showcases.” If others also participated in back-to-back showcases, their data also needs to be excluded from the analysis. I think it’s safe to assume that some (maybe most) of the other subjects participated in showcases in some capacity because the authors would have likely mentioned it if they hadn’t.
This would have meant that the showcase attendance was unique to the player that was injured, and so would have seriously helped their argument for exclusion. Let’s say for the sake of argument that five other players had participated in back-to-back showcases during this study; in that situation, all five of them should have been removed from the analysis. You can’t just cherry-pick and remove the one player that got hurt if others participated in showcases as well.
Going even further, I still don’t agree with this being exclusion criteria. The idea here is that the authors are arguing that the showcases had a causal effect on this athlete’s injury. Although coaches may assume that effect exists, to my knowledge, there is no existing research out there claiming that back-to-back showcase participation is related to injury. Because of that, it does not fit exclusion criteria from this study. Throwing injuries are more often chronic as opposed to acute. Beyond that, we don’t know a lot about throwing injuries and the causal nature of them. It’s nearly impossible to pinpoint it to one thing/event.
This is discussed further in the discussion, which I have some contentions with as well. After excluding those four players from analysis, the authors write that “No player sustained a baseball-related injury during the training program.” Later, they take that result and turn it into the claim that this lighter baseball training program did not increase injury risk. Injury prediction and prevention is one of the hardest things to research. I could discuss my thoughts on that further, but I’ll let this thread speak for me, as I think it’s one of the best commentaries on the variety of issues with injury prediction:
Injury prediction is a waste of time.
This area of inquiry has become dangerously pervasive and it damages sport science's reputation. Much misinformation & misinterpretation exists.
Below I've started a list of the many problems with the area – please feel free to add to it.
— Sam Robertson (@Robertson_SJ) August 2, 2019
As mentioned earlier, we know that most throwing related injuries are chronic and most likely due to build up over time and a variety of factors. Because of this, I would like to have seen an attempt at longitudinal looks at injury prevention with these players. This is one aspect of the Reinold et al. paper that was done well; they tracked injuries over the subsequent baseball season. This is a great methodology for baseball training-related research studies that are trying to look at injuries. What happens if a significant percentage of these players experience injuries later in their seasons?
You may argue that that could be the result of other factors, such as in-season workload after the training program was completed—which I agree with! But, this paper cites a study that used subsequent injury tracking in post (where they found that two of the four injuries that occurred in connection with a weighted baseball program happened later on in the season and not during the training program) as the main piece of evidence suggesting that weighted baseball training leads to a “significant increase in injury rates for players.” If the main piece of evidence for not using weighted baseballs in this study due to injury risk used a longitudinal study, I would have figured that the authors would use that same methodology to investigate their hypothesis, but they did not.
The other primary result of the study was that velocity increased over time. To be more specific, the mean change in velocity by the end of the program was 4.8 mph, and velocity increased for all but one player. That’s tight! As mentioned later in the discussion, “Fastball velocity is an important metric used by many to evaluate and grade baseball pitchers.” However, the discussion also goes on to argue that:
“Our hypotheses were confirmed, as the use of lighter baseballs (3 and 4 oz) was effective in increasing fastball velocity but did not cause any injuries in the pitchers who participated in the program.”
Based on the methodology of this research, I don’t believe that this claim holds weight. I’ve already alluded to most of my contentions with this claim throughout this review. Mainly, I believe this is a baseless statement because of the lack of a control group in this study.
Let’s take a look at the logic of the study.
I can see how easy it is to look at those three bullet points and say, “Lighter baseballs increase velocity and do not cause injuries.” But if you’re going to make that claim, all of the other things done during training have just as much of an argument for increasing velocity and reducing injury risk—the active warm-up, the light medicine ball work, the heavy medicine ball work, the long toss, the pulldowns, etc.
Additionally, the average age of the pitchers was 14.7 years old (from age 11 to 17). It seems more than likely that nearly four months of growth and aging could have benefitted velocity. This is another example of where a control group would have helped investigate the researchers’ hypothesis.
In the methodology section, the authors point out that the training program took place during the winter months. There’s no commentary on the training history of the pitchers going into this. There were two training sessions before the baseline velocity recording. More than likely, players took time off after their summer/fall season and then started to get back into winter training around the beginning of the study.
It’s possible that their initial baseline velocity was lower than their typical throwing velocity because of this, and the training program may have been effective only as a result of getting the pitcher back in shape.
The authors concluded that:
“A 15-week pitching training program with lighter baseballs significantly improved pitching velocity without causing any injuries, specifically to the shoulder or elbow. Lighter baseballs should be considered as an alternative to weighted baseballs when attempting to increase a pitcher’s velocity.”
This conclusion is true.
But, as I’ve summarized with all of my contentions laid out in this review, it’s more complicated than that. I appreciate the work that went into this research, but as with most research and papers, it has limitations, some of which the authors addressed. After reading their article, I would not feel confident in saying that, scientifically, “Training with lighter baseballs increases velocity without increasing the injury risk.”
Ultimately, this is just another lesson in the importance of reading research articles critically.
Without reading the rest of the paper, it would have been easy to take in the title of this paper along with a quick scan of the abstract and think that training with lighter baseballs increases velocity without risk of injury. As I’ve hopefully made clear, you can see that the interpretation of the results of the study is more complex and nuanced than that.

Motus Global Acquisition: Vision and Strategic Roadmap - Driveline Baseball,2020-02-11T22:00:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2020/02/motus-global-acquisition/,"We Acquired Motus Global!
As announced Monday, Driveline Baseball has acquired the sport sensor assets of Motus Global–specifically all sensor code and inventory, all trademarks and patents, all databases, and all outstanding contracts.
This begins a new era in Driveline’s history. One that will be marked by:
So What’s the Plan?
We bought Motus Global’s sensor business because we believed one truth:
This was a good but not perfect workload monitor for pitchers.
Nothing like it exists on the market.
What the team at Motus Global did when they built this technology is remarkable–it is affordable, it is directly applicable to an athlete’s routine, and it’s accurate enough.
As its next owner, we believe we can add value to the baseball community by validating Motus Global sensor data against our biomechanics lab, finding new ways to deliver value, and building features that improve baseball performance.
If you’re buying a Motus Global sensor from Driveline, you’re inviting us to be a meaningful part of your practice and gameday routines.
We owe it to you to be as accurate as possible. We previously validated the sensor against our biomechanics lab, concluding:
“Excepting elbow extension velocity, all metrics from the MotusBASEBALL unit showed significant correlations to their corresponding metrics from motion capture and while some magnitudes differ substantially and therefore fall short in validity, the link between the metrics is strong enough to indicate reliable casual use. Further research should be done to further investigate the validity and reliability of the arm speed metric.”
Driveline is going to deepen that validation work, investigating ways to make the sensor more accurate against our lab results.
Specifically, we’ll be undertaking these projects within the first 6 months:
Both of these projects not only improve the global accuracy of throwing stress and related metrics but will also improve the accuracy of the A:C Ratio calculation.
If we believe that acute/chronic workload ratios can help coaches and athletes build throwing volume successfully while reducing the risk of injury, then we owe it to the baseball community to make that technology as accessible as possible.
To that end, we will have a new subscription model with a lower-priced option and some new features coming this fall:
But that’s not the only feature set we are looking to improve.
One of the contributing factors to Driveline Baseball not being able to fully adopt the Motus technology stack internally was….lack of washing machines on site. We just didn’t feel like there was a work/reward trade-off to hand-washing 150+ sleeves every day (or creating a system internally that relied on athlete’s owning and washing their own).
Sleeves as a form factor are fine. But we’d like to make sure we’ve exhausted all of our options to find the best way to ensure the sensor is firmly in the right place for an entire day of throwing.
We have some ideas–we’ll be testing them.
With our ability to correlate sensor data directly to our lab in Kent, WA (and do so with a growing sample size of athletes), eventually Motus Global sensors can become an affordable, portable Driveline lab-in-a-box.
Working with other technology partners and teams, we can ultimately create analysis backed by accurate technology and sound science at an affordable price.
Combined with our efforts to find new ways to wear the sensor and new experiences that do not require use of the sensor every day, we believe Driveline + Motus Global can help pitchers at all levels get more out of their careers.
The Driveline/Motus Experience in 2021
A pitcher logs into their phone and sees that it’s Assessment Week.
For the next 3 days, they complete a variety of structured throwing plans with a prescribed number of throws, weights of ball, distances and effort levels. Based on that data, they get a score for where they stand relative to their peers.
Based on your drill performance, Driveline can recommend suggested drills for your athlete to improve.
For the next 28 days, they complete their work in Driveline TRAQ or the Motus DASH. They don’t wear the sensor and just mark their work for that day complete. Their A:C Ratio adjusts based on what we know from their Assessment.
The coach and the pitcher are alerted if work isn’t completed–or if A:C Ratios are deviating significantly.
If you need a coach, we have some available to evaluate your throwing program, data and video. If you don’t, keep doing your thing.
We have some work to get there…but we’re excited to start digging in.

Driveline Hitting KPI’s - Driveline Baseball,2019-12-13T04:19:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/12/driveline-hitting-kpis/,"At Driveline, we want to make sure we’re tracking what matters. There’s a plethora of technologies available that can pull up bat speed characteristics, batted ball outcomes, swing kinematics, all of the above, and none of the above. There’s a certain decision paralysis that results from this scenario where the endless options and combinations result in an infinite matrix of KPI’s.
From the hitting coach perspective, it can be difficult and time consuming to navigate Fangraphs, Baseball Prospectus and other sabermetric sites in order to take away a few nuggets to bring back to your hitters. The goal of this blog is to provide some actionable insight on what to track and how to train your hitters to achieve the desired results come game time. We’ll focus on the data collection system and how we selected metrics to collect data on, in addition to examining the information from the lens of the coach and applying these findings to hitting department KPI’s.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
Our data collection system involves our daily hitting groups (four hitters every hour) wearing Blast sensors and hitting on their respective profiles on HitTrax. The first challenge is remembering to keep our data collection process sound and consistent while making sure that players are using the right sensors on the right Blast profiles. The second challenge is accessing and processing the data we collect.
If you are a college or high school coach with access to Blast sensors and launch monitors (as well as nerds to process the data for you), you will be able to craft a similar system to ours. This requires that hitters are hitting with Blast sensors while their batted ball outcomes and metrics are recorded via Hittrax, Rapsodo or a similar tech. If you are a college team that practices daily, you can imagine how many paired swings you could amass over a season of fall ball. This can do a few things for you even in a short amount of time collecting data.
Again, creating a system like this requires some computational skills and the adequate organizational capabilities and resources to keep track of a large amount of Blast and HitTrax data.
Train at Driveline
As alluded to above, the number of available metrics as well as the number of statistical tools with which to interpret them can be very daunting.
For example, let’s take two (now) near ubiquitous stats: exit velocity and launch angle. How are we to decide whether to track mean EV versus, say, median EV or max EV? We could further introduce the mean of a variable above a certain threshold as another folded-in derivation—and that threshold itself could be contingent on another variable!
How about keeping track of the average EV between launch angles 10 and 26? How about the average EV between launch angles 20 and 26 and 10 and 15 separately? What about the average launch angle of balls hit with an EV above 95+? What about proportion counts: the proportion of balls hit above 95+ that fall into the LA buckets of 10 and 26? Or 10 and 15 and separately 20 and 26?
Without wasting your patience with more rhetorical questions, I hope my point stands as to the ease with which this can get out of hand. The above examples only depend on EV and LA (it bears repeating), whereas the accumulation of hitting technologies now spits out a much larger share of metrics.
So, let’s start with a few basic ideas  before we delve too much deeper. Let’s look at a few of the more popular metrics, and a few general ‘Step One’ ways of interpreting them. This will help us see what ultimately ‘plays’ at the level we’re all aspiring to understand better: MLB players.
The specific metrics we are going to examine in Part I of this series are:
1)      Exit Velocity (in a few different formats: mean, median, and top 8th average)
2)      Bat Speed (mean)
3)      Attack Angle/Launch Angle (mean, lumped together for reasons that will become clearer later on)
We’re going to apply these to cleaned Statcast data in an attempt to not only further our understanding of their importance, but also to clarify our expectations.
Before we go much further, there are a few cursory disclaimers to cover any time we talk about playing with MLB Statcast data. As covered in previous sabermetric pieces and on many Driveline PLUS videos, there are a few things to correct for when looking at publicly available Statcast data:
Here are a few more notes on the derivation of these metrics relevant to MLB figures.
Exit Velocity
Exit velocity should be intuitive as this number is generated by each ball in play (BIP). After the above corrections, means and medians can be straightforwardly calculated for each player. The top 8th EV average refers here (and in other places where ‘the Top 8th’ is referenced) to the average of each individual’s top 8 hardest hit balls.
Bat Speed (Warning: A little technical)
Bat Speed is a little bit more interesting. There has been work done in the past on reverse engineering bat speed from exit velocity. But at Driveline, we have a little bit more data to use, as our concerted data collection efforts on the hitting floor have allowed us to pair tens of thousands of rows of Blast and HitTrax data by their timestamps and users, allowing us now to put a concrete bat speed figure with batted ball data. Regressing completely off this we have found a simple linear regression explaining around 80% of the variation (or .8 R^2) of bat speed. However, this is an equation 100% dependent on exit velocity, which we know is not the *only* thing that goes into bat speed.
In fact, based on Alan Nathan’s work (and re-formatted in many different spots), we know bat speed depends on three things: a) exit velocity; b) the efficiency collision (EA); and c) the incoming velocity of the ball. The equation stands as BatSpeed = (EV – EA*PVelo)/(1+EA)
The above piece on reverse engineering bat speed also dealt with  deriving a bat speed figure from these variables, by assuming .2 for the top 15 hardest hit balls and -.1 for the top 15 softest hit balls and attempting to build a linear slope out of this, which gives each hitter an EA regression. We attempted to address a few of the assumptions in this method: the linear assumption of EA and EV; the idea that bat speed would be consistent across all situations; and the idea that there is just as much randomness in the top 15 weakly hit balls as there are in the top 15 hardest hit balls—and everywhere in between.
So, using our paired HitTrax & Blast data in an attempt to produce a more cohesive, statistically salient public estimate of bat speed, we did the following:
This may be a bit of seemingly-excessive work, and average EV and average bat speed figures still share a very high correlation, but it’s not 1 In addition, these bat speed figures are likely a little less precise at the ends of the distribution, as there is probably much less variance in bat speed between MLB hitters relative to our in-gym population, but we believe in its directionality and applicability for tracking intra-player changes, as will be our focus further in this piece.

Attack Angle/Top 8th LA
This will be a shorter digression, I promise In a previously penned piece called Pairing Blast & Hittrax Data Part II, we looked at validating the sabermetric contention that the average launch angle of the top eight hardest hit balls is a useful proxy for attack angle. We found it served quite well, with our combo figure resulting in a higher correlation, but also a higher RMSE. As such, we decided to roll with the industry accepted mean LA of top eight HHB’s.
Ok, so to keep it simple in the first volume of this series, we looked at our potential KPI’s in relation to a hitter’s talent level. We decided to use wOBACON as our indicator of talent level for various reasons. We approached our previously cited metrics of interest from three POV’s:
We looked at the full years of 2015 through 2019 and only used data from hitters that had at least 150 BBE’s per year (for that year of analysis) and its adjacent year (for year-to-year reliability figures); this cut-off of 150 was chosen as a reliability indicator in the aforementioned piece on the various cut-offs for reliability by metric.
Towards Addressing Point #1 and Point #3 (first half):
Note: The coded variable ‘nunique’ is included as the number of swings; I thought it would be interesting to use that as almost a sanity barometer, because a certain improvement in a metric should also correlate, in an ideal merit-driven world, with an increased number of opportunities.

Couple quick observations here:
The general gist of the last section can be boiled down to one straightforward aim: to identify the most useful and simplest metrics for evaluating the improvement of our hitters and our efficacy as hitting coaches.
During most training settings, the practice environment and technology itself does not perfectly replicate and track all aspects of the game. Specifically for hitters, it’s very difficult to track and judge plate discipline and contact stats. In today’s hitting development landscape, where buzzwords and unclear theories on mechanics run rampant, tracking movement and kinematics on a consistent (both a day-to-day and/or week-to-week basis) is extremely difficult, if not impossible, in the team setting.
Thankfully, we have solid statistical belief (covered above) that metrics such as EV and bat speed both effectively describe and predict wOBACON, our proxy for talent. Especially if you don’t have the ability or means to track other parts of a hitter’s arsenal, we can prioritize the characteristics we can track, and hold ourselves accountable that way.
EV
At Driveline, we have decided to track the average EV of each hitter’s Top 8th hardest hit balls, given its strong performance in describing and predicting wOBACON. This gives us a good indication of how hard the hitter hits the ball when he makes very solid contact. If this metric is far away from the hitter’s peak EV, then we know we are having some contact quality issues and can suggest a training intervention.
An example of such an intervention is changing the hitter’s programming to one of our contact quality templates. In these workouts, the hitter is still practicing with the intent of hitting the ball within 10% of their peak EV, but other constraints are added that focus on contact point and launch angle parameters.
Our in-gym data suggests that a deeper, more consistent contact point is also associated with talent level, as well as batted balls that result in a higher wOBACON. If the hitter is struggling with consistency, we have some pretty strong evidence that an inconsistent or too-out-in-front contact point is the culprit, and would adjust the training program accordingly. While the relationship between wOBACON and depth of contact point is not as straightforward as the relationships and metrics discussed above, it’s an additional, more nuanced look that we use to analyze the current and projected abilities of a hitter.
Bat Speed
We also found that bat speed even outperforms EV metrics as a descriptive metric and can be a better explanation for hitter improvement. This makes intuitive sense, as the faster the bat is moving through the hitting zone, the more capable you are of hitting the ball harder, producing higher EV and higher wOBACON. Bat speed is the driver of those two metrics. If the hitter is lagging in bat speed, we would suggest an intervention related to increasing the hitter’s bat speed, in order to improve higher values of top 8th and wOBACON.
Besides a steady diet of high intent swings with overload and underload, often putting an emphasis on the intention of moving the bat fast can make a large difference in a hitter’s training. The specific intent of moving the bat as fast as possible through the hitting zone is enhanced by the instant feedback from a bat sensor. This provides feedback in real time and allows the hitter to realize newfound strength from their training, and understand new movement solutions in order to move the bat fast towards as many pitches as possible.
Attack Angle
Attack angle has a positive relationship to most metrics in our analyses, but what we find important here is that hitters can achieve their bat speed and EV goals while falling in a fairly large range of attack angle that make sense for producing productive batted ball events.
We aim for hitters to fall comfortably a range of attack angle between 4 and 20. If the hitter gets closer to either end of this attack angle range, then we will propose an intervention that requires different intent, drills and training goals.
The intervention for players who struggle with attack angle (mostly low attack angle) is to place them on a program that emphasizes the above two KPI’s (EV and bat speed), with a focus on a higher launch angle.
In general, if a hitter hits the ball hard, you can estimate that the attack angle and launch angle will have similar values. For this reason, we give hitters the specific intention of hitting balls for fly ball trajectory as hard as possible. If this is executed, we can assume the hitter has found a movement solution to move the bat on a different plane, allowing them to achieve the desired outcome (higher attack angle and a high EV fly ball).
At Driveline, coaches are given a weekly report on the progress of each hitter. On this report is the improvement or decline of each player in Top 8th or bat speed. We have expected gains depending on  the hitter’s current phase and their initial talent level or proficiency in said metric. This helps us to most accurately determine their progress—or lack thereof.
With this information, we are able to focus on each hitter and understand why they are or are not getting better. If they are not getting better, the assigned trainer for that player is held accountable and expected to give reasoning as to why. If no one knows, we spend time as a group trying to problem-solve a solution for this player and others like him.
If a player is consistently making gains and exceeding expectations, the assigned trainer to that player is asked to stand up and present what he did to help that player improve.
This system has improved our skills as coaches by making our meetings more organized, and holding a hammer of accountability over the coach themselves. Our job is to get hitters better in a few key metrics that lead to on-field performance. If we can’t track these metrics and hold each other accountable, then we make little progress towards our goal of creating systems that help mass quantities of players improve—players at all ages, types and levels of baseball.
With this information, our efforts to improve programming and conduct experiments has intensified. Ultimately, we plan to expand and improve upon a system that allows the athlete to have the most specific intention possible when training. These intentions, of course, are informed by what we track. We train hitters to train with the focus of  hitting the ball as close as they can to their peak EV, moving the bat as fast as possible through space, and hitting the ball with an attack angle between 4 and 20 degrees.
*Above are example intentions our trainers provide our in-gym hitters. Highlighted are the specific constraints of launch angle and exit velocity, spray angle and contact point.
If you are going to track one thing, track bat speed. As mentioned in the analyses above, bat speed has the strongest relationship to wOBACON and will lead to improvement in your hitters.
This can be done simply by adding a bat sensor into your program. Pulling the data from Blast Connect is simple, and the data itself is easy to read. The website will give you a hitter’s average bat speed and attack angle, making tracking their improvement very straightforward. You could also get more granular and track 90th% bat speed and proportion of attack angle between 4 and 20 if that interests you.
Tracking average bat speed and attack angle should be sufficient. Most importantly, by tracking these metrics you will be able to supply your hitters with a very specific intent that directly relates to an improvement in on-field performance.
This is the coach’s dream!
Now, you can focus your energy on how to improve these key aspects and solve higher level problems, rather than guessing at what piece of mechanics can improve their game. Luckily, there are proven ways to improve bat speed, subsequent EV and attack angle. Best of luck to you and your program.

Mastering The Axis of Rotation: A Thorough Review of Spin Axis in Three Dimensions - Driveline Baseball,2019-09-06T23:25:17+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/09/mastering-the-axis-of-rotation-a-thorough-review-of-spin-axis-in-three-dimensions/,"When we observe the trajectory of an incoming pitch as it is released from a pitcher’s hand, we inevitably witness the interaction of a pitch’s total spin, release angle, initial velocity, and axis of rotation within the environment.
We perceive all of this information simultaneously, and make a determination on the spot as to whether we think the quality of a pitch is good, average, or poor.
The simplicity of measuring pitch quality via the eye test mentioned above is likely something we take for granted, particularly when we consider how complicated things can get when we try to quantify a pitch by its individual parts, rather than the sum of the whole.
Despite this difficulty, measuring a pitch by its individual characteristics is a necessary requirement in modern pitch design sessions when we’re identifying areas of need, monitoring progress, and developing new pitches.
Many pieces have been written by analysts (and ourselves) to help overcome the questions coaches and athletes face during pitch design; however, Spin Axis, arguably one of the most important and nuanced pitch components to conceptualize, has largely been overshadowed and ignored in the public realm, relative to other pitch characteristics.
To remedy the lack of attention given to Spin Axis, we’ll attempt to address many of the misnomers and areas of confusion surrounding the metric. The goal here is to bridge the gap between what we know about a pitch’s axis of rotation and other attributes of a pitch’s trajectory.
Perhaps one of the most frustrating areas of confusion surrounding Spin Axis is knowing what to call it. The original definition of ‘Spin Axis’ used by MLBAM during the beginning of the PitchFx Era (2007/2008) described the term as the estimated direction of movement via spin, in degrees, in only two dimensions (more specifically, the x-z direction, or the plane perpendicular to the direction of travel).
As we now know, a pitch’s axis of rotation is not defined in two dimensions; rather, Spin Axis is determined in three dimensions and is significantly correlated with the orientation of the pitcher’s hand just before ball release (Jinji, Sakurai, & Hirano, 2011).
By incorrectly defining Spin Axis as the axis of rotation in two dimensions (shown on the left in the image above from Nagami et al., 2011), many have confused the term Spin Direction—which, we argue, is the proper name for Spin Axis in two dimensions—with Spin Axis itself.
Thus, to clarify any confusion regarding the definition of Spin Axis moving forward, Spin Direction describes the axis of rotation of an incoming pitch in two dimensions (the x-z plane), whereas Spin Axis describes the axis of rotation in three dimensions (both the x-z and x-y planes).
Since translating movement into degrees isn’t necessarily the most intuitive process, a neat shortcut developed by Bahill and Baldwin called the right-hand rule provides us a straightforward way to determine the Spin Direction of a given pitch without the need for advanced technology. As shown in the picture below, if one simply wraps their fingers around the direction of spin of a hypothetical pitch in the x-z direction and extends their thumb all the way out, their thumb will be pointing in the direction of the axis of rotation in the x-z plane.
(Image taken from Bahill & Baldwin, 2007)
To translate the position of this outwardly facing thumb into degrees, one can turn to the polar coordinate plot provided in the space below to find which degree coincides with where the thumb is pointing to.
In the example given in the picture above, the thumb is pointing straight up, which coincides with a 90-degree value in the polar coordinate plot and the correct Spin Direction measurement for that pitch.
If the right-hand rule is a bit too basic, there are two alternative methods you could use to find spin direction.
Of course, calculating a metric that references a polar coordinate is probably less than ideal for those of us who struggled with trigonometry in high school, so both Trackman and Rapsodo introduced a metric called Tilt to the baseball community. Tilt, which is just a slight derivative of Spin Direction, reports the axis of rotation in the x-z plane in units of hours and minutes instead of degrees.
By translating the polar coordinate plot so that 180 degrees = 12:00, 90 degrees = 9:00, and 270 degrees = 3:00, accurately determining a pitch’s axis of rotation in two dimensions ended up becoming much more intuitive for most people. As a result, Tilt quickly became the primary metric for coaches and players to describe Spin Direction.
(The image above [originally taken from Sons of Sam Horn] shows the Tilt and Spin Direction of a LHP’s FF and FT fastballs from the perspective of the pitcher.)
While the shift from Spin Direction to Tilt as the preferred way to report a pitch’s axis of rotation in the x-z plane has helped the metric gain popularity in the baseball community, it should not be forgotten by coaches and analysts that Spin Direction still contains value as a standalone metric as well.
For example, if you’re using a Rapsodo unit for pitch design sessions and only have access to Tilt, you’ll be unable to calculate averages on a per pitch type basis, given that the figures provided to you will be in units of hours and minutes (try plugging that into a calculator) instead of degrees.
However, if you’re aware that both Tilt and Spin Direction are calculated in the same manner, then you know that each hour of Tilt is equivalent to 30 degrees of Spin Direction (360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour) and each minute of Tilt is equivalent to .5 degrees of Spin Direction (360 degrees / 720 minutes = .5 degrees per minute.)
Therefore, to calculate the average Tilt for a given pitch type, all you would need to do is convert the Tilt of each pitch to Spin Direction using the formulas provided below, then find the average Spin Direction of the pitch type in degrees and convert that number back into Tilt.
(Above is a step by step guide to converting Spin Direction and Tilt. As an example, take a RHP who throws a FB at 1:10. Since that pitch broke arm side, we set 12:00 to 180 degrees, we multiply the hour (1) by 30 and add that value to 180 (210). We then take the minutes (10), divide by two (5), and then add that value to 210. Thus, our Spin Direction is 215 degrees. To convert back into Tilt, divide Spin Direction (215) by 30 (7.1667), subtract by 6 and round down to obtain the hour (1). Take the numbers after the decimal point (.1667) and multiply by 60 (10) to obtain the minutes. Our Tilt is back at 1:10.)
Thus, both Spin Direction and Tilt can work in conjunction with one another when trying to better understand a pitch type’s axis of rotation. Knowing when to use each metric to your advantage can be beneficial when working through multiple pitch design sessions with a given athlete.
Apart from calculating Spin Direction and Tilt, the other main area of confusion surrounding Spin Direction is how it relates to arm slot. Most coaches and players are aware that there is a relationship between Spin Direction / Tilt and arm slot, but only one prior study (Brooks, Fleisig, & Pavlidis, 2015) has explored the relationship between the two in detail.
To further investigate the relationship between Arm Slot and Spin Direction ourselves, we estimated the arm slot of every MLB pitcher from 2015-2018 using methods similar to Cross (2015) and then bucketed these pitchers by average arm slot and player season.
With 6,752 player seasons containing an estimated arm slot classification, we further grouped these values by pitch type to produce the table below.
(The table above shows the average Spin Direction and movement profiles of pitch types by arm slot. Note, we extend Spin Direction past 359 degrees for CBs to account for ‘backup’ CBs. With our adjustments, we find that an over-the-top pitcher’s CB has an average Spin Direction of 387 degrees, which is the equivalent of 27 degrees on a polar coordinate plot.)
For virtually every pitch type, we see that a lower slot leads to an east-west movement profile (running FBs and sweeping breaking balls), whereas a higher slot leads to a north-south movement profile (high carry FBs and 12-6 CBs).
With the help of edgertronic footage, we can see exactly why this occurs. Lower slot pitchers have a hand and wrist orientation that is more parallel to the ground relative to their high slot peers, leading to more run and sweep. On the contrary, over-the-top pitchers have a hand and wrist orientation that puts them in a position to maximize top spin or back spin, giving them more carry on the FB and 12-6 shape on the CB.
(In the images above, we see how the differences in slot between a high ¾ release point [top] and a low ¾ release point [bottom] influences Spin Direction / Tilt. The uppermost image has a Tilt of 12:40, whereas the bottom image has a Tilt of 2:06.)
Clearly, there is a strong relationship between Arm Slot and Spin Direction, but the correlation between the two isn’t perfect given the mechanical and anatomical differences from pitcher to pitcher.
To investigate just how far a pitch type’s Spin Direction can be manipulated from its expected Spin Direction by arm slot, we took the seasonal averages of each MLB player’s Spin Direction by pitch type, paired that number with the expected axis of each specific pitch type given the player’s arm slot bucket, and subtracted the difference between the two.
With our new values, we were able to compare the differences in a player’s actual Spin Direction with their expected Spin Direction given their slot for each pitch type since 2015.
Our results indicate that MLB pitchers can add or subtract roughly 30 degrees from their expected spin direction on FBs and up to ~85 degrees on SLs (accounting for misclassifications). We feel that this is a sizeable amount of variance on a per pitch type level, lending support to the idea that pitchers can manipulate the axis of rotation on their secondary pitches without necessarily changing their release point or overhauling their mechanics.
This finding is important, as it tells us that altering the Tilt or Spin Direction of a pitch during a pitch design session can lead to significant changes in the shape of a pitch.
(The image above highlights the distribution of Spin Direction away from per-slot expectations by pitch type. Note, secondary pitches likely have inflated values due to misclassifications.)
Of course, when manipulating a pitcher’s axis of rotation on a given pitch type, Spin Direction / Tilt is only one of two metrics that needs to be considered. As mentioned earlier, Spin Axis is a three-dimensional concept, which moves along an x-y axis (or gyro component) as well.
Typically, the x-y component of a pitch’s axis of rotation is represented in units of Spin Efficiency or Active Spin, which is defined as the percentage of spin directly impacting the movement of a pitch (Rapsodo).
(The image above shows the distribution of Spin Efficiency at release for each pitch type in our Rapsodo database.)
In more technical terms, Spin Efficiency divides the proportion of a pitch’s spin components in the x and z direction (the square root of the sum of side spin and back spin) by the total spin imparted on the baseball.
Given that spin in the x-z direction (transverse spin) directly influences movement, whereas spin in the x-y direction (gyro spin) does not, Spin Efficiency is used by coaches and players to determine what percentage of spin imparted on the ball is causing it to move, as well as how the spin axis of the pitch is oriented in the x-y direction (towards home plate.)
Like Tilt, Spin Efficiency is an extremely effective metric because of its intuitive nature; however, it does have limitations in describing a pitch’s axis of rotation that are important to be aware of.
For one, Spin Efficiency does not provide any information to players and coaches about what the relationship is between a pitch’s axis of rotation in the x-y plane and movement. As a result, many coaches and players mistakenly assume, for example, that the relationship between Spin Axis and Spin Efficiency is linear and that a pitch with 50% Spin Efficiency has a Spin Axis that is directly split in-between being perfectly perpendicular and parallel with the direction of travel.
(Spin Efficiency is the cosine of Gyro Degree multiplied by 100. As a result, a Spin Axis with a 45 degree axis of rotation in the xy plane will not have 50% Spin Efficiency)
Unfortunately, Spin Efficiency does not have a linear relationship with Spin Axis in the direction of home plate (it’s actually calculated by taking the cosine of the angle that the spin axis of a pitch makes with the xz plane), which is why we prefer the metric Gyro Degree (defined in the image below) as a more descriptive and accurate measurement of the true Spin Axis of a pitch .
(Above, we see how Gyro Degree is calculated for two pitches from the overhead perspective. Pitch #1 [on the left] has a Gyro Degree of 45 degrees which is perfectly in between pure gyro spin (90 degrees) and pure transverse spin (0 degrees). The Spin Efficiency on this pitch is ~71%. Pitch #2 [on the right] has a strong gyro element to its axis of rotation, demonstrated by the 75 degree Gyro Degree. This pitch has a Spin Efficiency of ~26% [Image doctored from Nagami et al, 2011].)
Given the unique relationship between Gyro Degree and Spin Efficiency, most coaches and players are unaware of how the two relate to one another in terms of movement. As shown below, this has important implications when developing or evaluating a pitch type offering.
(The change in total absolute movement and Gyro Degree by increments of 10% Spin Efficiency. RHP only.)
Since cosine is more sensitive to changes at ~90 degrees than ~0 degrees, we see that players who throw a Gyroball would only need to adjust their Gyro Degree by ~11 degrees to gain ~20% efficiency, while players throwing a Fastball with 70% efficiency would need to adjust their gyro degree by ~28 degrees to increase their efficiency by the same amount.
The key takeaway here is that gyro-heavy pitches such as CTs and SLs should be easier to add Spin Efficiency to given the sensitive nature of Spin Efficiency at that level of Gyro Degree. Further, gyro-heavy pitch types will also have more volatile Spin Efficiency readings (a slight deviation in spin axis can have a large impact on Spin Efficiency) on a per pitch basis for the very same reason.
Another slight issue with Spin Efficiency is that it is indifferent to whether the Gyro Degree of a pitch is pointing in a positive or negative direction relative to home plate. While this is a non-issue for most pitches (LHPs typically spin the ball with a negative Gyro Degree, whereas RHPs typically spin the ball with a positive Gyro Degree), roughly 8% of all pitches thrown will have a Gyro Degree in the opposite direction of expectation given a pitcher’s handedness.
In particular, low slot pitchers will frequently reverse the Gyro Degree on their SIs and CHs, as shown in the edgertronic footage below.
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Video-for-Dans-Blog-.mp4
While this can be difficult to pick up at first without watermarks, our Driveline Edge tools are specifically designed to help us conceptualize the difference between two pitches with mirroring Gyro Degrees fairly easily.
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PC-Pitch1-1014-88.7-2353-29.31-Pitch2-1014-88.7-2353-29.31.mp4
(These two pitches have the same Spin Direction and Spin Efficiency, but opposite Gyro Degrees of 29.31 degrees [left] and -29.31 degrees [right].)
You might be asking yourself why the directionality of Gyro Degree matters, particularly when it’s understood that only Spin Efficiency, Spin Direction, and Total Spin determine how a pitch moves (minus drag).
Well, unlike what most players and coaches have been taught, gyro spin can contribute to the movement of a pitch depending on the pitch’s trajectory, the amount of gyro spin it has, and which direction the Gyro Degree is pointed to.
To briefly explain, because gyro spin (and all components of spin) stays oriented to the initial velocity vector rather than the actual trajectory of the pitch itself (which is manipulated by gravity and the magnus effect), some portion of gyro spin can be turned into side spin during ball flight, while some portion of side spin can become gyro spin during ball flight.
(The top image demonstrates what would need to happen for Spin Efficiency to remain constant throughout ball flight [the green gyro spin vector maintains alignment with the pitch’s red trajectory vector.] The middle image demonstrates what actually occurs due to gravity and release angle. This separation between gyro spin and trajectory causes a change in Spin Efficiency over ball flight, as shown in the bottom image [all taken from Kagan, 2017].)
For pitches that move glove side (Sliders & Curveballs), a small amount of Spin Efficiency is typically added during ball flight by the time it reaches the strike zone. For pitches that move arm side, a small amount of Spin Efficiency is typically lost by the time it reaches the strike zone.
(As Rapsodo is optical-based, whereas Trackman and FlightScope are radar-based, Rapsodo 2.0 is able to directly measure Spin Axis and provide us with Spin Efficiency at both ball release and plate crossing. The average change in Spin Efficiency throughout ball flight is given above.)
To gain a better sense of the magnitude of this effect, we bucketed breaking balls in 500 RPM intervals of gyro spin and calculated the increase in Spin Efficiency throughout ball flight.
In looking at the table below, we see that breaking balls thrown with at least 1,500 RPMs of gyro spin added ~8-10% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight, while breaking balls with less than 500 RPMs of gyro spin added just ~1% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight.
(The gain in Spin Efficiency during ball flight for breaking balls based on the amount of gyro spin they possess at release point.)
The effect size here is relatively small in terms of movement, as the change in Spin Efficiency equates to roughly 1-2 inches of horizontal break throughout the duration of ball flight. However, the key thing to note is that, in theory, this movement would occur “late” in a pitch’s trajectory. Therefore, these additional 1-2 inches of movement may be more difficult for the batter to perceive relative to more traditional movement. With a switch to an optical tracking system in MLB next season, we’ll be able to better determine whether this “late break” has additional value worth monitoring.
With these findings in mind, we hypothesized that if FBs and CHs typically lose Spin Efficiency during ball flight, they could, in theory, gain Spin Efficiency during ball flight if they were thrown with an inverse gyro degree. Depending on the effect size, this could give a slight advantage to certain low-slot pitchers who are able to manipulate the direction of gyro spin imparted on the ball.
To test this, we separated all inverse Gyro Degree FBs and CHs from normal Gyro Degree FBs and CHs and averaged the change in Spin Efficiency from release to home plate for both groups. As shown in the table below, FBs and CHs thrown with an inverse Gyro Degree in our dataset gained ~1.5% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight, while FBs and CHs thrown with an expected Gyro Degree lost 2.5% of Spin Efficiency during ball flight.
Given that the effect size between the two groupings of pitches only amounts to a ~4% difference in Spin Efficiency (worth ~1 inch of movement), it’s unlikely that manipulating the direction of gyro spin influences batter perception.
However, knowing when and how an athlete produces an inverse Gyro Degree on a specific pitch may be important when trying to develop consistency with a FB or CH. Thus, monitoring inverse Gyro Degree pitches may be worthwhile if you have the requisite technology.
To wrap up Spin Axis in the x-y plane, we believe that both Gyro Degree and Spin Efficiency serve a unique purpose in the pitch design process and are best used interchangeably with one another (similar to Tilt and Spin Direction). While Spin Efficiency is easier to conceptualize and translate to coaches and athletes, Gyro Degree is more descriptive of the actual axis imparted on the ball itself.
As you’ve probably gathered from reading this, analyzing the axis of rotation on a given pitch and putting it into proper context is both challenging and rewarding.
Since every pitch component makes up an important piece of the puzzle when designing a pitch for an athlete, it is critical that we understand how each pitch characteristic fits in with one another to put our athletes in the best position to succeed.
Spin axis is no different, and being able to more efficiently derive meaning and make adjustments to a pitch’s axis of rotation during the pitch design process can be a difference-maker when developing the right pitch.

How to Be a Biomechanist with Mokka - Driveline Baseball,2019-08-30T04:35:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/08/how-to-be-a-biomechanist-with-mokka/,"So you want to be a biomechanist? Well, you’re in luck! This blog will teach you about Mokka, a great open-source software program used for kinematic and kinetic analysis. You can use it to start looking at biomechanics data in 3D, for free!
“But I don’t have any biomechanics data?”
Don’t you worry! We do!
At Driveline Baseball, we publish our research papers in PeerJ, an open-access, peer-reviewed scientific journal.We also publish all of the sample data alongside the studies—and it’s completely accessible to the public. We recently published two studies using 3D motion-capture data (.C3D file format). Follow the links below to find download links for.C3D files in the “Supplemental Information” section.
Also, if you’re a Driveline athlete who has recently had a motion-capture assessment with Driveline Baseball, you can reach out to your trainer to ask for access to your own C3D files!
“Alright, so I’ve got the .C3D files. What do I do now?”
Below is a step-by-step guide detailing how to download and use Mokka to view/visualize .C3D files. If done right, the final product will look something like this!
Download link: Here
Download Folder: Here
Save these somewhere on your computer. I will save them to my desktop and access them in later examples.
These files are used to attach edges/faces between the markers and create a model of sorts with the biomechanics data. Without these, you’d only see a giant floating cloud of dots in the Mokka workspace. These model configuration files are totally customizable, so you can make/adjust your own if you’d like! Mokka has really helpful documentation available if you want to do more here.
NOTE: There are actually three separate model configuration files. You’ll need certain configuration files for certain .C3D files:
Screen-capture video: Here
***IF you do not see orange lines connecting the dots like above***:
The markers on the right side of the screen will most likely say “Skeleton1:” or “Skeleton2_” in front of the marker label names like this →
This is where you have to load a different configuration file based on the text before the marker labels, as mentioned earlier.
Woooo, you should be all set! You can actually do a lot more in Mokka than just replay the files from different angles. There’s tons of room to explore Mokka’s tools and analyze the files on your own.
Here’s a fun example of something you can do to visualize tracking paths on specific markers to show arm path!
Have fun with Mokka! And make sure to tag us on twitter @DrivelineBB if you do something cool with it!

Do you have advice on how to capture your own 3D Motion data? Is there an inexpensive DIY way that is recommended?
Hey Nick, if you want a cheap way to capture your own 3D motion data, come train with us! It’s a standard part of our assessment process that every pitcher goes through. Otherwise, you are looking at a pretty expensive setup. You can check out this article on our lab. If you are interested in us helping you build out your own, shoot us an email.
Can this be used for hitting? I’m an Associate Hitting Coordinator at a high academic college and I would  love to be able to do this for our hitters.
Yes, you may use this for hitting! However, Mokka only accepts certain file types. We use .c3d files to input into the application. We will acquire data from an athlete taking swings in our lab. This data is then cleaned by our biomechanists who create the final file form.

Validating Rapsodo 2.0: Pitch Design Made Easier - Driveline Baseball,2019-07-31T02:34:47+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/07/validating-rapsodo-2-0-pitch-design-made-easier/,"As player development in baseball continues to rapidly evolve, the demand from coaches and facility owners to integrate sophisticated, reliable, and affordable technology into their players’ training plans has never been higher.
In recent years, many products have entered the marketplace attempting to capitalize on this new-found demand for data-driven programming, but few have been able to find an adequate balance between affordability and practicality.
Enter Rapsodo, which released its original optical-based pitch tracking system in 2016 and subsequently put reliable ball-flight metrics into the hands of coaches and players at a price within budget.
Combining a quality product with 3rd party validation, great customer service, and exceptional technical support, Rapsodo burst onto the scene throughout all levels of baseball and became a staple within the industry, popularizing the pitch design movement into what it is today.
However, despite the large sum of value that Rapsodo’s original unit has provided coaches and players over the past three years, Rapsodo 1.0 still possessed a few shortcomings that left users wanting more.
For example, the original Rapsodo unit had to be set up on a tripod roughly 6 ft behind home plate to accurately measure ball-flight information. This created issues when someone on the mound was wild or when space behind home was limited.
The original unit also had a relatively long processing time between pitches and a small window to capture incoming pitches. If the unit was not given enough time to process the previous pitch, the new pitch would not register. Subsequently, if a pitch was thrown a foot or more outside the strike zone, the unit would miss a pitch or provide only a velocity reading.
Because Rapsodo calculated pitch trajectory using images of a pitch’s spin rate and axis as it was released from the hand, rather than via the flight path of the ball itself (like Trackman and PITCHf/x), Rapsodo lacked the necessary information to calculate a 9 parameter fit of each pitch’s trajectory. Without these specific measurements, coaches and analysts were unable to perform several relevant analyses—such as generating tunneling metrics, comparing release point parameters, or incorporating release and approach angles—into their pitch design sessions.
To address and overcome some of the limitations with the original unit, Rapsodo designed and released the 2.0 unit (MSRP $4,000) prior to the start of Spring Training in 2019.
Rapsodo 2.0 now contains a more durable casing with a versatile setup location on the ground, positioned 15.5 ft in front of home plate. With a sturdier body and more convenient setup, pitchers no longer have to worry about hitting the unit directly with a pitch and causing damage, and facilities can finally use Rapsodo 2.0 in live or confined settings with no limitations.
To address the sizable collection of misreads and missed pitches, Rapsodo 2.0 also incorporates a faster processing time in between pitches and a larger window to read pitches headed well outside the strike zone. Indeed, as shown in the bar graph above, these changes are a net positive for Rapsodo 2.0 users, as several validation tests show that Rapsodo 2.0 is able to read roughly 79% of all pitches thrown in a given session, whereas the original unit can typically only read about 62%.
Rapsodo 2.0 also provides coaches and athletes with more data points for analysis. For all users, release height, release side, and release angle are now provided on the user interface, while vertical and horizontal break have been adjusted to accommodate the ability of the new unit to pick up the baseball closer to release point on its flight path.
For “Pro Level” subscriptions (a premium feature mostly designed for MLB teams), users are now able to view 9-Parameter Fit estimates generated by Rapsodo, as well as supplementary metrics such as trajectory-based horizontal and vertical break derived from the 9-Parameter Fit estimates itself.
At face value, the new features included with Rapsodo’s 2.0 unit provide users a large step up from the original model. However, with a new setup location, pitch-movement algorithm, and a suite of additional release-point metrics, it was clear that Rapsodo 2.0 needed to be validated before it could be fully endorsed over the dependable, original model.
Our Rapsodo 2.0 beta unit arrived in late January, and we immediately began pairing pitches between our new and original units to measure any discrepancies between the two systems. Unfortunately, despite high expectations, Rapsodo 2.0’s first validation test did not go as planned.
While velocity seemed to be within a reasonable margin of error between both units, estimates of spin- and trajectory-based movement were off by roughly 3-5 inches per pitch. Further, raw spin, spin efficiency, and plate-location errors were all outside of our comfort zone as well.
We continued to test and provide feedback to Rapsodo, who were willing to exchange our beta unit for a regular model and develop regular software updates to reduce errors. By the end of March, discrepancies between spin-based movement (again, the new default movement metric provided by Rapsodo) and legacy movement (Rapsodo 1.0’s movement values) decreased by 1-inch per pitch, and errors related to raw spin, spin efficiency, and plate locations were nearly halved.
While these improvements in the accuracy of Rapsodo 2.0 meant that most metrics provided by the unit were up to standard, there were still two major concerns with the unit that we felt needed to be addressed before we could consider the unit an upgrade from 1.0.
Namely, Spin-Based V-Brk was consistently inflated on FBs by roughly 2-inches per pitch, and pitches thrown from a low arm slot could not be read and measured by the unit.
Since one of these issues was a software error (inflated V-Brk errors) while the other was a hardware issue (not picking up side-arm release points), Rapsodo worked with our R&D department and training floor throughout the spring to test a variety of different setups, software updates, and hardware accessories to solve both issues.
By the end of May, Rapsodo’s team of engineers had developed a lift kit with a string of software updates that increased 2.0’s tracking ability of side-arm pitchers and eradicated the inflation bias of V-Brk on FBs.
With demonstrated reliability over the past month of testing, we are now pleased to report that the unit is as reliable as the base model when using it in conjunction with the lift kit and up-to-date software.
While using the lift kit may add an extra step during the calibration process, we believe that it is a must-have for coaches and players to ensure Rapsodo 2.0 is working up to its full capacity. Lift kits (shown below) are now included with every Rapsodo 2.0 unit sold from this point forward at no additional cost to the user.
The progress made by Rapsodo over the past four months has been impressive, and we believe that Rapsodo 2.0 is now a sizeable upgrade over the original model. That said, there are still items that need to be further tested to make sure users are getting the most out of this new version.
Namely, the 9-Parameter Fit estimates and subsequent trajectory-based movement metrics available to “Pro Level” subscribers are still susceptible to occasional misreads. While this is of no concern to non-MLB and minor league affiliate users, we do recommend that all users be cognizant of outliers when looking at Rapsodo’s new release point metrics during pitch design sessions for this very reason.
Further, a development in our most recent validation tests has indicated that vertical-plate location discrepancies now hover around 7-8 inches per pitch between Rapsodo 1.0 and Rapsodo 2.0. While this is perhaps somewhat unsurprising given the nature of how both units respectively reverse engineer ball flight, we felt it was important to note for users moving forward.
At Driveline, we invest a lot of resources validating 3rd party technology to ensure our coaches and players receive accurate feedback to improve performance. Often, this work can be frustrating given the black box nature and lack of customer support which many tech companies within baseball usually operate under.
However, as was the case in 2016, Rapsodo is the exception to industry standard. They were willing to work and communicate with us every step of the way to improve their product on a weekly basis.
Not only does Rapsodo’s refreshing approach speak volumes to where the unit is today compared to when it was released, it also provides us with an optimistic outlook for the functionality and validity of the system moving forward.
We’re excited for the future of Rapsodo 2.0, but most importantly, we’re now confident in the value it can provide today’s coaches and athletes as well.

Calling the Right Pitch: Investigating Effective Velocity at the MLB Level - Driveline Baseball,2019-05-24T06:10:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/05/calling-right-pitch-investigating-effective-velocity-mlb-level/,"In a game transformed by the Sabermetric Revolution, where the most important components have been optimized and made more efficient, pitch sequencing has largely remained an art form resistant to the most technical analyses. Although many analysts have attempted to crack the pitch sequencing code, the expertise needed to select the right pitch at the right time has been presumed to be an innate skill possessed by those able to size up complex pitch-level details in ways that spreadsheets and models cannot.
Thus, players and coaches, without a definitive blueprint to choose one pitch over another, have historically relied on a combination of feel and several lightly tested pitch sequencing theories to differentiate good sequencing from bad.
While these sequencing theories are typically founded on sound reasoning, oftentimes they make assumptions that contradict one another, causing confusion and debate amongst players, coaches, and analysts about the optimal pitch decision within a given situation.
To minimize the subjectivity surrounding pitch sequencing, our goal over the next few months is to validate many of the underlying assumptions and theories on which modern pitch sequencing is predicated. By understanding which theories have merit and which are unsupported at higher levels of the game, we can gain a better understanding of how to optimally sequence pitches and get the most out of our athletes’ raw abilities.
In searching for a place to begin researching the effects of pitch sequencing on performance, we decided to investigate one of the more well-established and popular theories surrounding pitch sequencing: Perry Husband’s Effective Velocity (EV) Theory.
Effective Velocity is arguably one of the most widely-believed theories on pitch sequencing and has been featured on MLB Network, SBNation, Fangraphs, and a variety of other mainstream publications in the baseball community.
At its base level, EV theory suggests that two pitches thrown with the same velocity, but different locations, will be perceived by a batter as having different speeds, depending on where a point of contact estimate with the pitch is made. For pitches located high and inside, where batters are believed to hit the ball farther out in front of home plate, reaction time is minimized. For pitches located low and away, where the ball is believed to travel deeper in its trajectory, reaction time for the batter is maximized.
Effective Velocity attempts to account for the estimated response time that hitters are afforded during a given pitch by adding or subtracting hypothetical MPHs to a pitch’s release speed based on where contact needs to be made relative to home plate.
(The graphic above, taken from Perry Husband’s website, illustrates how location interacts with release speed to influence a batter’s perception of an incoming pitch. Note that Husband’s actual adjustments are supposedly more granular than what appears above, but it is unclear what his exact adjustments truly are.)
Like several other pitch sequencing theories alluded to above, EV aligns well with intuition, is rooted in quantitative analysis, and has been endorsed by prominent names within the industry. However, to date no thorough third-party testing has been completed in the public realm to validate many of the claims associated with EV theory.
In an attempt to fill this void in the literature and determine whether EV is a reasonable strategy to base pitch sequencing decisions on, this analysis uses MLB Statcast data from 2015 to 2018 to examine some of the more measurable components of EV theory listed in the table of contents below:
We find that although EV theory is rooted in interesting theoretical concepts that have influenced the game positively, the verifiable aspects of Effective Velocity are not supported by more rigorous statistical analysis at the MLB level. As a result, we should be cautious when applying many of the fundamental concepts of EV theory if we intend to put our players in a position to succeed. The reasons for this are laid out in the statistical analysis below.
For us to validate the claims of EV theory, we first need to obtain a set of adjustments that allow us to add or subtract the proper amount of MPHs to a pitch at a given location.
While this should have been an easy first step, the literature on EV theory lacked consensus zone adjustments that were both publicly and privately available and specific enough to apply to a pitch-level database. With no guidelines on how to construct an EV strike zone of our own, we elected to apply Xan Barksdale’s more detailed estimates of zone adjustments to our database via the EV strike zone visualized below.
(Estimates for strike zone height and width were taken from Wayne Boyle’s Strike zone, while each zone was adjusted for batter height. Further expansion to Barksdale’s zone was incorporated to account for pitches outside the strike zone, so that we could apply these adjustments to our entire MLB Statcast database.)
With Effective Velocity now accounted for in our database of over 2.8 million pitches, we first wanted to verify one of the most straightforward claims in EV theory: batters are able to perform at their highest levels when facing a pitch thrown at 90 EV MPH.
For those unfamiliar with this claim, EV theory states that hitters are geared to hit a 90 EV MPH pitch, as it has been observed that league wide HR percentage, batting average, and hard hit rate all peak against 90 EV MPH pitches. Furthermore, it is also posited that once a pitch is thrown at least 3 EV MPH faster or slower than 90 EV MPH, batter production drops off “pretty dramatically” from peak levels.
To investigate whether this effect is actually observed at the MLB level, we turned to our Intrinsic Run Values, which control for count, park, and defense, to run a simple regression looking at the relationship EV MPH has with overall outcomes at the plate.
(If EV theory exactly described the pitcher/batter relationship, you would expect to see a graph that looked like an upside down U—with downward slopes on both sides of 90 EV mph. Instead, production is relatively flat across speeds from 85-90 EV mph and then dramatically slopes down.)
The results visualized above are perhaps a bit surprising given that we’d expected to see either a straight, linear relationship with Intrinsic Runs and Effective Velocity—which indicates that batter production increases as batter reaction time does—or a defined inverted U shape that peaks at 90 EV MPH—which would support the idea that batter performance peaks and drops off, as EV theory suggests.
(For comparison, the red line represents the relationship between EV MPH and Intrinsic Runs had EV theory been supported, the blue line represents what we believe is the actual relationship with Intrinsic Runs Values and Effective Velocity, and the yellow line represents the actual relationship between Effective Velocity and Intrinsic Run Values.)
Without observing either expectation, we believe that our results were skewed by a fair amount of selection bias within our dataset. That is, because MLB pitchers are sent down if their performance falls below a certain level, there will inevitably be a performance floor that pitchers cannot fall below. This effect leaves only elite soft-tossers in the big leagues, whose fastballs play up despite their relatively slow velocities. In looking at the relationship between EV MPH and Intrinsic Run Values at the MLB level, our regression line, therefore, must flatten out at some value of Effective Velocity, which appears to occur at approximately 89 EV MPH.
How does this relate to EV theory’s initial claim that batter performance peaks at 90 EV MPH? Well, it is likely that if pitchers below replacement level weren’t immediately sent down, leaving only exceptional soft-tossers remaining in the big leagues, we’d continue to observe a linear relationship with Effective Velocity and Intrinsic Run Values. This means that EV theory’s first claim, which states that batting outcomes peak at 90 EV MPH, is likely not supported by our analysis. Additionally, we find that there is no evidence suggesting that batter performance drops off by a significant amount at a +/- 3 EV MPH threshold from a hypothetical performance peak. This gives us added confidence that EV theory’s first claim is not confirmed at the MLB level.
Test Summary
It is important to consider that many aspects within the game of baseball have changed in the 15+ years since Husband first researched EV theory. Since pitchers can now throw the ball harder than ever, and batters are better equipped to handle the heat, perhaps it is not so surprising that relationships between batter production and Effective Velocity have changed significantly in more recent years.
Our next test looking to validate whether EV sequencing theory is supported at the MLB level is largely immune to the ever-changing playing environment in the big leagues, given that it only considers pitches relative to one another rather than in absolute terms, like the test above.
So, what is EV sequencing theory, and how can it be validated? As shown in the graphic below, EV sequencing theory has many layers and facets surrounding it, but at its core it suggests that hard-hit batted balls are often a function of timing, which can be significantly altered in a batter’s favor if two consecutive pitches within 6 EV MPH of one another are thrown in back-to-back succession. (That is, an 84 EV MPH changeup following an 89 EV MPH fastball.)
(The graphic from perryhusband.wordpress.com indicates that 52% of the hard-hit batted balls during the 2017 postseason occurred when a pitch was within +/- 6 EV MPH of the previous offering. This is relatively close to the expected rate of 50% originally derived by Husband using Inside Edge data.)
In support of this theory, research by Perry Husband has found that roughly 50% of all HRs and hard-hit batted balls at the MLB level have occurred when back-to-back pitches have been thrown within 6 EV MPH of each other, whereas only roughly 10% have occurred outside the EV window and tunnel. While this is seemingly powerful surface-level evidence suggesting that poor sequencing habits are largely to blame for bad outcomes on the mound, we argue that these numbers lack the essential context for reaching any definitive conclusions about the predictive nature of EV sequencing.
For example, although Husband suggests that 50% of all HRs occur on pitches that are within +/- 6 EV MPH of the previous offering, we still do not know what proportion of pitches included in his sample fell within this threshold. It’s possible that 75% of the pitches in Husband’s dataset were within +/- 6 EV MPH of the previous pitch, which would indicate that HR probability would decrease, rather than increase, against these highlighted pitches.
Furthermore, we also have no information as to how context was controlled for within these results. This leaves us wondering whether pitches thrown within or outside a +/- 6 EV MPH threshold occur in similar counts with equally talented pitchers throwing to equally talented batters.
As a result, we felt more testing on EV sequencing theory was necessary to quantify what the exact performance repercussions of throwing back-to-back pitches within +/- 6 EV MPH truly are.
Classifying Pitches Within or Outside +/- 6 EV MPH
To validate EV sequencing theory using our newly created EV MPH database, we calculated the difference in EV MPH for each sequence of pitches at the MLB level since 2015 and threw out the first pitch of every plate appearance in our dataset (which will automatically have an EV Difference of 0 MPH). Left with only pitches included within a sequence, we classified every pitch as either having an EV MPH differential within or outside the +/- 6 EV MPH threshold and averaged Exit Velocity, Launch Angle, xwOBACON (xwOBA on contact), HR Rate, and Intrinsic Run Values for every pitch within each classification. The results generated are shown in the tables below.
(By bucketing pitches as being either within or outside the +/- 6 MPH EV threshold, we see that there is little evidence supporting the main tenets of EV Sequencing Theory once we control for count via Intrinsic Run Values. Note: Higher Intrinsic Run Values indicate an advantage to the batter, whereas lower run values indicate an advantage to the pitcher.)
In initial support of EV sequencing theory, we found that pitches within the +/- 6 EV MPH threshold were hit roughly ~.7 MPH harder in terms of Exit Velocity and had a 9-point advantage in xwOBACON in comparison to pitches outside of the EV MPH threshold. Considering that a batter’s timing is supposed to be optimized for pitches within this threshold, we found this to be a pretty interesting surface-level result.
However, not every column in the tables above lended support for EV sequencing theory. For example, we found little evidence that supported the claim that 50% of the league’s HRs were hit on pitches within +/- 6 EV MPH of the previous pitch, nor did we find any suggestion that pitches within the EV MPH threshold resulted in more HRs (given that the difference in HR Rate within the subsequent classifications is no more than .03%).
Furthermore, our Intrinsic Run Values, which control for count, park, and defense, actually found a reverse effect in batter performance against pitches within or outside the EV MPH threshold relative to what EV sequencing theory suggests.
Why was there a reverse effect found for Intrinsic Run Values despite an uptick in all other offensive performance metrics? As shown below, a higher proportion of pitches within the +/- 6 EV MPH threshold in our sample were thrown in hitter-friendly counts (when pitchers were doubling or tripling up on fastballs to avoid a walk), whereas a higher proportion of pitches outside the +/- 6 EV MPH threshold were thrown when pitchers had the advantage in the count. Thus, our Intrinsic Run Value metric was the only column that was not influenced by a sizeable count-effect, which is illustrated below.
Controlling for Context: Building EV MPH Regressions
With this in mind, we felt it was clear that accounting for all relevant context was necessary if we wanted to accurately determine whether an increase in EV MPH between pitches suppresses batter performance at the plate.
We ran four separate regressions that allowed us to control for batter, pitcher, count, platoon advantage, and pitch type, in addition to the factors already accounted for in our Intrinsic Run Values.
(Regressions 1 & 2 tested whether a pitcher or batter benefited from throwing two consecutive pitches at least +/- 6 EV MPH, whereas regressions 3 &4 tested whether a pitcher or batter benefited from any increase in EV MPH between two pitches. We found a significant positive relationship with the difference in EV MPH between pitches and run values in three out of the four regressions. This indicates that there is no evidence at the MLB level supporting the claim that throwing pitches within +/- 6 EV MPH are more likely to result in worse outcomes for pitchers. Click Here For Regression Outputs.)
In three out of the four regression outputs, significant relationships comparing the difference in EV MPH on back-to-back pitches and Intrinsic Run Values were observed in the opposite direction from what EV sequencing theory suggests. In other words, after controlling for all relevant context, batter results actually improved as the difference in EV MPH on back to back pitches increased. These results run counter to the main principles of EV sequencing theory, and provide strong evidence of a reverse effect relative to what EV theory suggests.
Without being able to definitively determine why an increase in the difference of EV MPH on back-to-back pitches induces significantly better outcomes for batters, we hypothesize that pitches with large differences in an EV MPH sequence, after controlling for pitch type, are largely a result of a pitcher missing his spot. For example, if a pitcher is continuously trying to work low and away against a batter with a nitro zone middle-in, and subsequently misses inside on the third pitch of the sequence, it is likely that both the expected run value and the delta in EV MPH on the pitch would both increase and contribute to the effect that we observed.
(Upon completing this analysis, we were made aware that Perry Husband’s initial analysis had used a threshold of +/-3 EV MPH to analyze EV sequencing theory. Given that we believe publicly available language suggests that the EV threshold stands at +/-6 EV MPH, we elected to keep our analysis unchanged. However, as one can see above, if we do drop our threshold to +/- 3 EV MPH, we still find a strong reverse effect between EV MPH differential and batter outcomes.)
We would be remiss if we did not mention that our analysis of EV sequencing theory was unable to account for EV tunnels, which identify specific instances where pitch pairings with large differences in EV MPH are not able to disrupt a batter’s timing. Since ignoring this concept (not by choice) could have significantly impacted some portions of our overall results, we note that EV tunnels were also unincorporated within the original Inside Edge analysis performed by Husband ~15 years ago. Considering that Husband was still able to extract significant findings in relation to EV sequencing theory within that study, we are confident that our overall finding—that EV sequencing theory is not supported at the MLB level—is unaffected by this limitation.
Test Summary
With two attempts to validate EV theory on a per-pitch level having failed to provide much support for the basic tenets of EV, we decided that it would be best to shift our overall focus to examine the concepts of Effective Velocity on a per-season perspective.
Perhaps some of our findings in our analyses above could have been caused by poor pitch execution at one specific time, rather than a flawed sequencing strategy used over the course of an entire season. If this were true, we’d expect that pitchers who consistently use EV sequencing to gain an advantage would see a performance boost, whereas those who fall victim to poor EV sequencing over the course of a season would see a performance hit.
To test this theory, we obtained the 2018 averages of important performance metrics for every pitcher with at least 100 pitches thrown during the MLB regular season and calculated their Absolute EV MPH differential (the difference in EV MPH between back to back pitches) and EV threshold percentage (the percentage of pitches outside of +/- 6 EV MPH) for comparison. To measure how these EV metrics compared with a pitcher’s talent, we also retrieved each pitcher’s 2019 Steamer Projections of RA9 and joined these values to our dataset.
Correlating EV Metrics With Performance
After running correlation coefficients to identify any potential relationships between our seasonal EV metrics and overall performance, we again found little support for EV theory. As shown in the first matrix below, no EV metric (column items) had stronger than a .08 correlation with any performance metric (row items), with EV threshold percentage actually indicating a slight inverse relationship with Steamer Projected RA9. In other words, this meant that as a pitcher’s EV threshold percentage rose (i.e., more pitch pairs in a sequence that had greater than a 6 EV MPH absolute difference from the previous pitch over the course of the season) so too did his proxy for true talent.
(The matrices above highlight the correlation coefficients between each column item and row. Pitchers with at least 100 pitches thrown in 2018 [top], had no observed correlations between our EV metrics and relevant measures of performance, whereas pitchers with at least 1000 pitches thrown in 2018 [bottom] had slight correlations.)
While these results were somewhat expected given our prior testing, we decided to boost our pitch threshold for players in our sample up to 1,000 pitches to control for any discrepancies between starters and relievers. As shown in the correlation matrix directly above, by filtering out nearly every reliever from our dataset, we were able to observe far more agreeable relationships with Effective Velocity and performance metrics.
For example, 2019 Projected RA9 had a closer relationship with both EV sequencing metrics after scaling up to a 1,000 pitch filter, while correlations with xwOBACON and HR rate both suggested that as the absolute difference in EV MPH increases between pitches, so too does hard contact.
Given that these results run counter to our earlier findings regarding EV sequencing theory, we were a bit surprised to find slight discrepancies with our pitch-level analysis. However, once we looked back at our previous analysis more closely, we realized that these slight correlations between EV and performance metrics should have been expected all along.
(Because more talented pitchers have a tendency to end up in better counts, their Abs EV MPH differential and EV threshold percent will likely increase as a result. Thus, better pitchers will naturally have inflated EV metrics regardless of whether they abide EV principles. This effect likely explains much of the relationship between EV metrics and player talent.)
Is There a Slight Relationship With EV Metrics and Talent?
In looking at the table above, we recalled that there was a direct relationship between the count and the absolute difference in Effective Velocity that needed to be controlled for. That is, we found that the further a count was in a pitcher’s favor, the more likely his EV sequencing metrics were to rise.
Given that our seasonal analysis did not control for count, and more talented pitchers typically throw in better counts, we realized that our best pitchers in our sample had inflated EV metrics regardless of whether they abided by EV sequencing theory or not. Thus, at least some portion of the relationship between EV metrics and talent was likely explained by a count effect, rather than a pitcher’s leveraging EV principles to gain a competitive advantage.
Furthermore, when looking at the leaderboards of EV threshold percentage provided above, we also observed that a player’s EV metrics had been strongly influenced by the number of pitch types he had within his respective arsenal during the 2018 season. If EV sequencing theory had a noteworthy influence on seasonal pitching performance, we argue that we would have likely seen more defined EV sequencing profiles among leaders and laggards independent of a pitch arsenal. Additionally, if EV sequencing had any influence on true talent, we almost certainly would never observe one-pitch relievers, like Kenley Jansen and Zach Britton, being among the best in the game despite having the worst EV threshold percentages in baseball.
To test our suspicions, we filtered our database to include only pitches thrown in neutral counts and then re-calculated every player’s EV Threshold Percentage (this EV metric better accounts for players that have a slow curveball in their arsenal). With a new EV metric that better controls for count, we ran a simple regression that predicted Projected RA9 by EV Threshold Percentage and found insignificant results (R^2 value of .0279).
(In neutral counts [0-1, 1-1, 1-0, 2-1], there is a slight, but insignificant relationship between EV Threshold Percentage and Projected RA9. Perhaps in specific instances EV sequencing could benefit an individual pitcher, but an overall effect is not found in our sample.)
Considering that EV threshold percentage is only slightly correlated with Projected RA9 after accounting for context, we found it unlikely that EV sequencing can help a player perform significantly better over the course of the season.
Test Summary
Given that we had come up a bit short in finding much evidence to support the basic tenets of EV theory, we began questioning whether our initial EV zone adjustments were to blame. Perhaps there are large discrepancies between our zone and Husband’s that were causing our results to falter, or, even more concerning, perhaps neither of our zones were quite that accurate at depicting reality and subsequently need to addressed.
To find out what a true EV zone adjustment should look like, we decided to pull HitTrax batted-ball data on all of our professional hitters during the past professional off-season. The reason for using HitTrax in this analysis is quite simple: the system is able to measure point-of-contact depth directly, allowing us to more accurately measure the relationship between where a pitch crosses home plate and how far it needs to be hit out in front.
After smoothing depth of contact by plate location for every batted ball in our data set, we were able to produce the following visualization:
(We leveraged HitTrax data to measure the relationship between point of contact depth and pitch location. For pitches up and in, batters made contact farther out in front of the plate than average, which is shown in red. For pitches low and away, batters made contact a bit deeper than average, which is shown in blue. The white S-curve represents an average point of contact depth, equivalent to roughly 23 inches in front of the back tip of home plate. This aligns quite closely with Husband’s “Zero Line” and resembles most publicly available EV zone adjustments)
Right away, we saw immediate agreement with what EV theory and intuition suggest: pitches up and inside are hit farther out in front, pitches low and away are allowed to travel deep, and pitches that stretch diagonally across the zone from down and in to up and away are hit at average depth.
Translating Contact Depth By Location Into EV Estimates
While certainly a promising initial result, we still had more work to do in order to translate these predicted point-of-contact estimates into effective velocity adjustments.
Since all of our pitches in our dataset were still classified by Barksdale’s zone to accommodate our initial EV adjustments, we simply re-grouped each pitch by zone, averaged each pitch’s true EV adjustment, and compared the results using the visualizations below.
(The graphics above compare the Xan Barksdale zone [left], which was used in our initial analyses, with actual EV MPH adjustments [right], based on directly observed point-of-contact data and simple physics equations. Although EV theory correctly predicted the direction of requisite MPH adjustments needed to control for a batter’s estimated point of contact at a given location, it seems to have over-exaggerated the scale.)
Clearly, the results indicate that there is a misrepresentation with the scale at which EV zone adjustments are applied in the public domain. While Husband’s estimates suggest that there is a 8-10 EV MPH spread between pitches at the extremes of the strike zone, our research indicates that a more accurate figure is somewhere closer to 1.25 EV MPH.
Validating Estimates of Effective Velocity
To examine which EV zone adjustment was more sensible, we turned to Alan Nathan’s trajectory calculator and compared three hypothetical pitches thrown with equivalent EV MPH readings and a constant release point. More specifically, we used a 90 mph fastball thrown down the middle, an 86 mph fastball located up and in, and a 94 mph fastball located low and away.
Since EV theory suggests that all three pitches should be hit with an equivalent reaction time based on respective point of contact estimates, we should expect to see a large, but reasonable, spread of contact depth among the three pitches if traditional EV adjustments mirrored reality (as depicted in the visualization below).
Instead, we observe that batters would need to possess nearly 6 feet of plate coverage to be able to hold reaction time equal for all three pitches! More specifically, if we assume that the point of contact for a 90 mph fastball down the middle is 23 inches from the back edge of home, this would mean that an 86 mph pitch would have to be hit 68.6 inches in front of the back edge of home, on average, whereas a 94 mph would have to be hit 1.9 inches behind the back edge of home, on average. For comparison, our newer estimates assume that batters would only need roughly 11 inches of plate coverage to hit those same three pitches at a similar reaction time.
When considering the distribution of contact depth realized by our own athletes, we find little support for traditional EV reaction-time adjustments within this analysis.
Test Summary
By confirming our suspicions that fallacious zone adjustments were interfering with our ability to accurately measure whether EV sequencing theory has any validity at the MLB level, we were motivated to re-run our earlier test on EV sequencing theory to see if our preliminary findings would be affected.
So, we broke out our newly created EV adjustments based on the analysis directly above, and re-classified every pitch in our data set as either being inside or outside the +/- 6 EV MPH threshold. Of course, because our new EV zone adjustments are significantly smaller in scale compared to our old adjustments, we expected to see quite a few pitches from the “outside” classification in our initial analysis make their way to the “within” classification in our new analysis, potentially influencing our prior results.
(Our updated tables comparing the average performance metrics of pitches classified as either within or outside the +/-6 EV MPH threshold show that despite using more accurate EV adjustments, we still find no evidence of EV sequencing theory using Statcast data.)
As predicted, our “within” classification bucket grew in proportion to the “outside” classification bucket by about 76,000 pitches, but given that our entire sample included over two-million pitches, this really only represented about 3-4% of all pitches in the dataset. Without much transfer of pitches between classification buckets, it was obvious that we would once again observe that pitches outside the EV MPH threshold were typically hit harder than pitches within the threshold (albeit with less authority than before), but that this relationship would reverse course once we controlled for count via our Intrinsic Run Values.
The key takeaway here is that despite significantly altering our EV zone adjustments, the proportion of pitches within each classification bucket didn’t change much. This tells us that pitch selection is likely the primary driver of EV sequencing, rather than location, and regardless of whatever zone adjustments applied to a dataset, it’s unlikely to find much support for EV sequencing theory.
Test Summary
Without being able to validate tangible components of EV, we began to question whether there was really any value added by adjusting a pitch’s release speed to account for the reaction time gained or lost by a batter via a point of contact estimate. Up until this point in our analysis, no measurable component of EV theory had been supported, and at its most basic level, it was still unclear whether Effective Velocity provided any additional statistical power that Release Speed didn’t.
Thus, we felt it was necessary to run one final test to see whether pitchers can leverage Effective Velocity on their fastballs to achieve better outcomes in overall performance.
Correlating Fastball EV Metrics to Performance
Similarly to our per-player analysis above, we filtered our 2018 database by fastballs and calculated the per-player averages for a variety of relevant performance metrics. Effective Velocity (based on our Barksdale estimates), EV – Release Speed (which isolates the effect of pitch location on batter reaction time in units of mph), and Release Speed were all added into the mix to allow for us to directly compare Effective Velocity’s ability to describe performance relative to Release Speed. Once all of the metrics were compiled, we developed a correlation matrix demonstrating the relationships among all of our values.
(The matrix above is based on 2018 data for fastballs only. At first glance, EV – Release Speed, which is just a consideration for point-of-contact estimates translated into mph, correlates quite well with swinging strike % and has a slight relationship with our proxy for talent. However, when release speed is added back into the equation, we see that Effective Velocity provides no added value relative to release speed in any of our performance metrics.)
At first glance, the EV – Release speed metric seemed to do pretty well on its own in relation to overall performance. For example, the correlation between EV – Release Speed and swinging strike percentage was found to be .31, indicating that reducing batter reaction time via EV principles may have some merit in generating a whiff. Additionally, when looking at the relationship of EV – Release Speed and Projected RA9, we observed a slight, but promising, relationship between the two, indicating that perhaps leveraging EV theory on fastballs might not be such a bad idea after all.
However, a closer examination of the results above revealed that most of EV – Release Speed’s statistical power was based off of a slight correlation of .127 with Release Speed itself. When comparing Effective Velocity directly to Release Speed, we found that EV did no better in correlating with our proxy for true talent (Projected RA9). Although it may have had a slightly stronger correlation with swinging strike percentage, this likely had more to do with pitchers manipulating vertical approach angle and exploiting above-average vertical break than it did minimizing batter reaction time. As proof of this concept, once we separate pitchers into EV – Release Speed leaders and laggards (shown below), we see that most pitchers are locating their fastball primarily based on the pitch’s movement profile, rather than adding hypothetical ticks onto their fastballs.
(These leaderboards represent the pitchers who led the league in using location to either add or subtract EV MPH to their fastballs in 2018. Given that several of the leaders have above-average carry on their fastball, whereas the laggards predominately throw sinkers, it seems reasonable to suggest that most pitchers are looking to locate their fastballs in areas that suit their movement profiles, rather than to manipulate batter reaction time.)
We believe that this is enough evidence to suggest that Effective Velocity has little ability to predict or describe performance, and conclude that MLB pitchers do not use EV principles on their fastballs to gain a competitive advantage over their peers.
Test Summary
With the understanding that Effective Velocity had little association with performance outcomes at the MLB level, we hypothesized that the same should likely be true of Perceived Velocity, given that it also adjusts pitch speed in units of mph based on batter reaction time. Thus, we obtained 2018 player estimates of Perceived Velocity via Baseball Savant and joined these values with our previously created database. By subtracting Release Speed from Perceived Velocity (PV – Release Speed) and switching out our Effective Velocity metrics for our newly calculated Perceived Velocity metrics, we were able to update our correlation matrix to compare the relationship between Perceived Velocity and relevant performance metrics in the table below.
As was the case when looking at EV metrics, Perceived Velocity was found to have a slight edge over Release Speed in swinging strike percentage, but once xwOBACON and Projected RA9 were considered, Release Speed once again remained king.
These results provide more concrete evidence that manipulating batter reaction time (within the constraints of the rules of the game) to gain a competitive advantage on the mound is perhaps a more complicated task than initially believed. In considering this, it is understandable that EV theory would struggle to hold up against more rigorous analytical testing.
Test Summary
As we wrap up our analysis on EV theory, we are left wondering why Effective and Perceived Velocity do not provide additional information related to overall performance when compared to raw Release Speed. Surely controlling for batter reaction time has to account for something, right?
In our opinion, we believe that Effective and Perceived Velocity fall short of the mark because both inherently contain unnecessary assumptions that oversimplify complex interactions with a batter’s ability to perceive an incoming pitch.
For example, if Effective and Perceived Velocity were true in absolute terms, we would have to observe the following:
Aside from all three of these rather large assumptions likely being false, the names of both Perceived and Effective Velocity imply that batter perception can be accurately measured without considering task demands (Gray, 2013), fatigue (Proffitt, 2006), swing mechanics, or any object in the batter’s perceptual environment (Scott & Gray, 2009), which we know can all play a significant part in how a batter observes the speed of an incoming pitch (Fajen, 2007).
Simply controlling for reaction time in units of mph gives us only a small slice of the information necessary to determine how a batter perceives the speed of an incoming pitch. We believe that the public would be much better served with an accurate reaction time estimate for each pitch, rather than a metric that attempts to translate velocity and distance into units of time. That way, other sequencing models would have the opportunity to build on this information more efficiently than EV and PV have led us to believe.
In spite of the belief that EV theory can provide pitchers with an ultimate sequence for success, the analyses above find very little indication that EV theory is effective at the MLB level.
While disappointing, we find it important to acknowledge that pitch sequencing will likely always be an art-form to some extent, and that Perry Husband’s EV theory has helped pave the way for some of the more important qualitative discoveries surrounding pitch sequencing in the past decade. As a result, we do not view this analysis as a step backward in terms of what we know about pitch sequencing; instead, we view it as an important stepping stone in disseminating theory from fact and art from science.
As technology progresses and more sophisticated data sources become publicly available, there will be countless opportunities to unearth important discoveries related to pitch sequencing. However, some level of skepticism about existing and emerging theories is essential as we refine our knowledge of pitch sequencing and attempt to put our players in the best position to succeed.

Would you be willing to share what the actual number in inches from the back of the plate the four ‘corners’ of the strike zone [up/in, up/out, down/in, down/out] were?  (can estimate by the shade but would like the numbers). Thanks
Would the Percentages and data used in the EV sequencing theory used by Perry Husband’s study be invalid given the cheating taken place that year by the Astros?  I don’t know what teams were used to conduct that study specifically. Great stuff as always. Just curious. Thank you.
Isaiah, thanks for the question, it is interesting to revisit analyses considering that information. I’m not sure what numbers Perry Husband would have looked at specifically, but I suspect it would be league wide data from a similar time period to the one Dan used in his analysis here (2015-2018). This would have included data from when the Astros, and other teams potentially involved in electronic and non-electronic sign stealing. Nonetheless the inclusion of a large body of data gives us reasonable confidence that even if we were to exclude potential culprits there, we would still obtain qualitatively the same results. Other results such as looking at point of contact depth from Hittrax and calculating velocity adjustments for each location using physics that do not factor in in-game performance would remain unaffected.

Developing More With Less: Does Efficiency in Player Development Lead to Success? - Driveline Baseball,2019-05-04T04:44:18+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/05/developing-less-efficiency-player-development-lead-success/,"Can we accurately evaluate an organization’s ability to acquire and develop players relative to their competitors? In part one of our mini-series looking at the overall state of minor league player acquisition and development, we attempted to answer that question by building a database of over 8,000 minor league players in order to assess each organization’s ability to generate value. With dollar estimates of surplus value that controlled for player expenditure and expected talent levels for incoming players, we were able to identify industry leaders and laggards in player development. We were also able to quantify a preliminary estimate of monetary value realized by more progressive teams via a first mover’s advantage.
In this post, we build on our preliminary methods and analyses to examine how data-driven player acquisition and development contributes to a sustainable model of success at the major league level. Using our baseline estimates to generate more specific and reliable results, we evaluate the merits of unique team-building strategies and provide more realistic estimates of the surplus generated by each respective farm system in baseball.
Heading into the 2015-2016 off-season, the San Diego Padres organization found themselves in a make-or-break situation. Having won 74 games the season prior with a roster built to “win-now,” the organization faced the difficult decision of choosing whether to stay the course or to rebuild internally.
The front office chose the latter, and invested heavily in amateur and minor league talent over the next few seasons. With $80M spent in International Free Agency, three top-ten picks, and a bevy of trades that netted them the likes of Fernando Tatís Jr., Chris Paddack, Francisco Mejía, and Anderson Espinoza, the Padres jumped from 25th to 1st in Baseball America’s Organizational Talent Rankings, constructing a rebuild that likely surpassed even the most optimistic of expectations.
While surely an organizational-wide effort, many of the public accolades given to the Padres for their successful rebuild were directed towards their player-development department, who transformed many young, talented athletes into some of the premier prospects in the game.
But, given the wealth of riches that San Diego’s player-development department were gifted, do we really know whether all of the praise they’ve received is justified? For every Luis Urías and Joey Lucchesi that has been signed and developed, a rival farm director can point to several expensive international signings in the Padres system who have not yet lived up to the billing. In considering the sheer investment in minor league talent that the Padres committed to the project, did they receive the value they expected, given what was spent?
Answering this type of question is not straightforward because there have been no publicly available resources to date that have analyzed an organization’s farm system while controlling for player expenditure. As a result, fans, coaches, and even team executives have leaned on anecdotal examples of the successes and failures of different players to develop opinions on whether a team has been efficient at signing and developing young talent.
Fortunately, our Value Generated metric (introduced in part one of our mini-series) provides a solution to this issue by controlling for expected value acquired by a given farm system. Uninfluenced by the various investment strategies of teams or the subjective opinions of insiders, our metric not only provides a valuable KPI to MLB organizations, but also allows us to investigate the merits of different spending strategies used in building MLB rosters.
With most of the work already done for us, our Value Generated estimates for each organization are provided below. As highlighted in part one, organizations with strong reputations in amateur scouting and player development—such as the Astros, Dodgers, and Cardinals—have realized approximately $350M to $450M in surplus value over the past seven seasons. In contrast, teams with more traditional approaches to player acquisition and development have incurred approximately $175M to $350M losses within the same time span.
(By splitting the results into subsets of 3-4 year buckets, we see how some teams like the Braves, Rays, Yankees, and Padres have trended upwards in recent years, whereas the Tigers, Rangers, Giants, and White Sox have had little success in acquiring and developing talent in the minors since 2016.)
With a staggering difference in surplus value realized between leaders and laggards, we see that the organizations toward the top of our leaderboard have maintained a consistent advantage in developing talent over the past seven seasons, while the gap between the lower performing teams and league average has widened as prospects within our sample progress to full maturation.
Equipped with our metric, we wanted to first address how farm-system rankings can be influenced by both total expenditure in minor league players and efficiency in acquisition and development. This analysis allows us to decipher the following:
In returning to our Padres example from above, we expect that the organization would score well in Value Generated, particularly since 2016, but see that they ranked 15th in Value Generated since 2012 and 9th overall since the start of their rebuild. In the Padres having the number-one farm system in baseball, we have evidence supporting the idea that some combination of both above-average player acquisition/development and heavy investment in prospects played a significant role in boosting their farm system to the top of the rankings.
Applying this analysis to the other 29 teams, we can further leverage the most recent Baseball America (BA) Talent Rankings to identify which organizations have invested heavily in minor league players but have still fallen short in producing homegrown value and which organizations have continued to generate surplus value, albeit with limited opportunities.
(This table uses our Value Generated metric to obtain the difference between expected and actual 2019 BA Talent Ranking. We see that the White Sox, Padres, and Rays have talented farm systems without an exceptional amount of Value Generated, indicating that they have likely made a sizeable investment in MiLB talent during recent years. Meanwhile, the Red Sox, Cubs, and Giants have poorly rated farm systems that have likely resulted from low investment and/or poor Value Generated in recent years.)
In using a simple linear translation of 2016–2019 Value Generated to 2019 BA Talent Rankings (a Spearman’s rank correlation of .41 was found between the two), we observe some interesting takeaways. First, organizations ranked towards the bottom of our Value Generated metric—such as the Reds, White Sox, and Marlins—all received BA Talent Rankings that were 6-16 spots ahead of where we would expect, given their ability to generate value at the minor league level. Using this to conclude that each organization has invested heavily in young talent but has received relatively little value in return, we can see that constructing a home-grown competitive roster now likely requires both efficiency in player acquisition/development and heavy investment, rather than just the latter.
In an effort to address the former, both the Reds and White Sox have recently made several changes to advance the state of their player development and maximize the most out of their recently acquired young talent. However, only time will tell if these changes will improve both teams’ standing in our Value Generated rankings over the next few seasons.
On the opposite side of the spectrum, organizations found at the top of our list of Value Generated that have received a worse BA ranking than expected—such as the Red Sox, Yankees, Nationals—have been able to supplement their organizations with significant surplus value in the minor leagues, despite having “win-now” rosters. Even when considering market size, it is likely no coincidence that these organizations have had sustained success at the MLB level over the duration of our sample, given that they’ve been able to provide their big league team with cost-controlled talent or trade capital for postseason runs.
Last, we also observe a handful of organizations—like the Cardinals, Dodgers, and Astros—who have developed superior Value Generated estimates relative to their peers and a better farm-system ranking than expected. Likely blending a strategy of continuous investment in prospects with superior scouting and player-development modalities, these organizations have seemingly developed a sustainable model of success for both present and future outcomes at the major league level.
Having demonstrated that an organization’s respective BA Organizational Talent Ranking is a function of both efficiency in acquiring and developing talent and overall investment in prospects, we wanted to quantify just how important Value Generated is in making a significant impact on the overall success and long-term health of an organization.
To examine this, we calculated the correlation between winning percentage and Value Generated over the past seven seasons. We found a fairly robust correlation coefficient of .62. As shown below, some teams can outperform expectations with shrewd pickups, large budgets, luck, or aging cores. However, for most teams, getting surplus value from their farm system above expectations is a prerequisite to maintaining consistent success over an extended period of time.
To gain a sense of the savviest teams in the free-agent market and/or other means of player acquisition, we extrapolated our Value Generated metric into an expected winning percentage over the past seven seasons. This allowed us to find the difference between actual and expected average-win totals by season in order to see how much each organization outperforms expectations over time.
We see that our new leaderboard is biased in favor of large markets and teams that were built to win before the prospects in our sample fully matured. That said, there are also creative small-market value shoppers—such as Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, and Tampa Bay—who score really well by this metric.
At the bottom of the list, we see teams like the Twins and Diamondbacks—who developed strong cores over the mid 2010s, but failed to put the pieces together to build a contender—as well as the Phillies and Blue Jays, who exchanged a large amount of prospect capital to extend competitive windows in a non-sustainable manner. Other organizations found at the bottom of the list above—such as Houston, San Diego, and Atlanta—spent a large portion of the 2010s rebuilding their MLB roster from the bottom up and are now reaping the benefits moving forward.
With confidence that our metric measures something related to past performance, we divided our results into buckets of position players and pitchers to further identify whether some teams have specifically struggled or excelled in developing bats or arms.
In looking at the table above, we observe some interesting outliers that align closely with our expectations. For example, our results show that Boston, Minnesota, and Oakland have had much greater success in developing hitters compared to pitchers, whereas the opposite holds true for teams like the Royals, Yankees, and Phillies.
Beyond just splits, we also can quantify observations made by other fans and analysts regarding an organization’s ability to develop a specific type of prospect. For instance, it has been well documented that the Cubs have struggled mightily to develop any pitching over the past seven years, and our Value Generated metric estimates that they have lost $126M in expected value on pitching prospects during that time frame. Meanwhile, the Astros and Yankees, who have each received high praise for integrating advanced technologies into their pitching programs, have each realized over a $200M profit in pitchers during the same window.
Since amateur scouting and analytics departments also play a significant role in supplying player-development departments with athletes who are above or below expected talent upon arrival, we wanted to develop a method for analyzing player-development departments in isolation. To do so, we looked at how well certain organizations have influenced the FV’s of prospects they exchanged from other organizations via trades.
For our analysis, we assumed that any change in FV for a prospect within one year of being traded was caused by switching from one organization to another. As a result, a team would be rewarded for improving the FV of an incoming player within one year of arrival, whereas the other team would be punished by an equal amount.
For example, when Alex Jackson was traded from the Mariners to the Braves heading into the 2017 season, the Braves were able to boost his FV from a 40 to a 45 during his first year with the organization. Based on Jackson’s immediate improvement, our methods credited the Braves player-development department with $5.9M in Value Generated and debited the Mariners player-development department $5.9M in Value Generated.
Since this analysis is a zero-sum game with diminished sample sizes, some teams will benefit from trading players to organizations with worse player-development departments, whereas other teams may fall victim to random variation or trading valuable pieces before maturation. Therefore, we have to take these results in context rather than strictly at face value.
In looking at the table above, we see the Yankees, Dodgers, and Brewers have excelled at either selling high on certain prospects, targeting and developing lesser known prospects from other organizations, or trading with the right teams at the right time. In contrast, the Cubs, Rays, and White Sox have taken particularly strong hits in recent trades, with the Cubs losing Eloy Jiménez, the Rays failing to accrue much value out of their recent acquisitions in the upper levels of the minors, and the White Sox taking significant hits on the Adam Eaton, James Shields, and Chris Sale swaps.
A main concern outlined in the beginning of our initial post that still needs to be addressed is whether credit can accurately be attributed to a respective organization for the various prospect outcomes it realizes. Perhaps our Value Generated metric is simply identifying the random luck that each organization has been exposed to over the course of the past seven years and is not a reflection of an organization’s ability to acquire and develop quality MLB caliber players.
For example, although the White Sox are docked heavily in our analysis for not getting expected value out of the Adam Eaton trade, one could reason that Baseball America was a bit high on the likes of Lucas Giolito or Reynaldo López at the time of the trade compared to the rest of the industry. The public widely regarded the deal as a coup for the White Sox, but the White Sox could very well have had lower internal grades on both of the aforementioned players received and still valued that package as the best opportunity to improve their organization. As a result, our model would punish the White Sox too severely due to a lack information.
Since we do not have access to all of the details on certain transactions, interactions, or developmental plans for specific players, we cannot fairly attribute 100% of the observed credit of Value Generated to each individual team and must regress these values.
To do so, we take each team’s Value Generated on a yearly basis and calculate the reliability in our entire sample. Using the Spearman-Brown prediction formula, we find that the threshold needed to explain half the variance in our Value Generated metric is approximately 35 years, so we regress our raw values to $0 by 83.33% to account for this uncertainty.
As you can see from this table, there is still a significant amount of value generated between the best and worst organizations, despite a heavy amount of regression baked into our final estimates.
While these newer estimates of Value Generated are probably closer to the true monetary advantage that the best organizations have realized since 2012, it is also likely that these estimates are slightly too conservative given that we regressed every organization to $0 and limited each organization to only 30 minor league prospects of value per year via The Baseball America Handbook.
These methods artificially suppress our reported numbers because we know that specific organizations (particularly at the higher end of our chart) prioritize and outspend their competitors in player development by a significant margin and that they also have more than 30 players of value in the minors. As a result, organizations such as the Astros and Dodgers should have more optimistic reported estimates of Value Generated that are regressed to a higher dollar amount, relative to their peers.
As proof of this concept, competitors towards the bottom of our list—such as the Phillies, Giants, and Rangers—have all adopted significant changes within their player-development departments that align more closely with the trendsetters in the industry. In our opinion, this indicates that there were clear competitive advantages in player development realized by the Astros and Dodgers during the years in question that should be accounted for.
However, since we are constrained by the information available and want to avoid adding additional assumptions or estimates of value generated, we elected not to adjust our final values to account for these limitations. Instead, we report a conservative $135.4M difference between the best and worst organizations in MLB at acquiring and developing talent for players entering affiliate baseball after January 1, 2012.
Despite the uncertainty and chance that has always been a part of analyzing prospects, our analysis finds strong evidence that heavy investment into progressive means of player acquisition and development has provided early adopters, such as the Dodgers and Astros, with a massive competitive advantage over the rest of the league over the past seven seasons.
As teams grasp this and rapidly attempt to catch up, we can’t help but feel cautiously optimistic for the future of baseball. As players are taught to swing with more efficient swing planes, throw with better secondary pitches, and train with modalities that are actually proven to improve performance, the quality of play and the outcomes of the most talented players will surely improve.
This does not mean that there will not be any bumps in the road along the pathway to optimization. Top prospects will still fail to make it to the big leagues, amateur players will continue to be mis-evaluated, and certain developmental plans will still be ineffective—this is inevitable.
However, it is (and always has been) our position that we can put our players and coaches in the best possible position to mitigate these negative outcomes .
So, as we push ahead towards the 2019 season and beyond, this analysis shows us that the question worth answering is no longer a matter of if data-driven player acquisition and development can lead to more efficient outcomes: it is a matter of how.
As the gap inevitably closes between the best and worst organizations at developing talent, some will find a way to move ahead of the curve and some will fall even further behind. Regardless of where each team ends up finishing in the race to catch the likes of the Astros and Dodgers, it seems clear that it will be worth every penny for them to try and catch up.

Can’t believe no one has commented yet. This article is fantastic! As a Pirates fan, I came here for hope? Maybe they’re doing something right? I don’t think they are w/ regards to talent acquisition, though. Oneil Cruz is an interesting case of increasing the value of an asset received in a trade, but I don’t know how much of that came from instruction over it just clicking for him.
Anyway, keep these coming. I’m fascinated w/ talent development and this was a phenomenal read.

Is Finding a Star Nothing But Luck?: Quantifying the Effectiveness of MLB Player Development - Driveline Baseball,2019-04-20T03:09:36+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/04/finding-star-nothing-luck-quantifying-effectiveness-mlb-player-development/,"As we’ve continued along with The Business Case For Player Development Series, we’ve attempted to evaluate and analyze specific subcomponents of player development in today’s rapidly changing landscape. These micro-level analyses have been useful in identifying the cost of inefficiencies that still occur within player development; however, they have also been limited when attempting to extrapolate these findings on an industry-wide perspective.
In this mini-series, we attempt to expand our focus to analyze the overall state of player development over the past seven years. More specifically, we attempt to quantify each organization’s respective ability to acquire and develop young talent within the minor leagues. These outputs will give us insight into how important a highly functioning player-development department is to win at the MLB level and extend a competitive window years into the future.
This blog post outlines the details and methods behind the creation of our estimates, as well as provides some initial findings. A subsequent post will take a deeper dive into our results and provide some key takeaways for the industry moving forward.
Just past the halfway mark of the 2008 season, the Milwaukee Brewers were coming off a winning streak that moved them up to second place in the NL Central. Motivated to make the playoffs for the first time in 26 years, Milwaukee’s front office orchestrated one of the most famous mid-season deals of all-time, netting CC Sabathia for Matt Laporta, Zach Jackson, Rob Bryson, and a player to be named later.
Sabathia went on a historic second half run that led Milwaukee to a coveted playoff berth, whereas Laporta, the twenty-third ranked prospect by Baseball America at the time, sputtered shortly after switching organizations.
Luckily for Cleveland, the fine print of this deal contained a gentleman’s agreement stipulating that if Milwaukee made the playoffs, Cleveland would get the option of choosing between Michael Brantley or Taylor Green as the final player exchanged in the trade.
With the Brewers clinching the wild card on the last day of the 2008 season, Cleveland took up the opportunity to choose Brantley, who went on to amass 19.7 fWAR before leaving in free agency eleven seasons later.
As it stands, the trade perfectly illustrates how good scouting, good player development, and a massive amount of luck can make a significant impact on the successes and failures of an organization. For all the praise owed to the Indians for identifying, acquiring, and developing a mid-tier prospect into an All Star, there was an equal amount of criticism due for missing on Laporta, Jackson, and Bryson.
This is one of the challenges in evaluating the outcomes of different players within a given organization: there is no telling who deserves credit for the positive or negative, or whether there is any credit worthy of being distributed at all beyond pure chance.
However, as challenging as evaluating a scouting department or a player development department may be, we believe quantifying player acquisition and development is still a worthwhile analysis to undertake. Beyond potentially helping us identify whether continual increased spending on player development is a sensible investment for teams, a robust examination can also provide us with insight into whether one organization can identify and nurture a player to the big leagues with greater success than another, considering all else equal.
Is identifying and developing young baseball players into productive big leaguers an organizational skill? Or are farm system returns merely driven by variance?
With a sample of minor league players large enough to sift through the noise, we find evidence that some organizations are indeed better suited to acquire and develop prospects of equal talent. These organizations, led by heavy investors and early adopters of progressive means of player development, have been able to extract massive amounts surplus value over their competitors during the past seven seasons.
To obtain accurate estimates of an organization’s ability to identify and develop a player, we set out to build a large enough dataset of recently acquired minor league players that allowed us to perform the following tasks:
1)     Generate an expected NPV via Future Value (FV) for every minor league player entering professional baseball to control for organizations that have a greater opportunity to acquire higher caliber amateur prospects.
2)     Map changes in expected NPV via FV for every minor league player on a yearly basis to control for minor league players who switch teams via trades.
3)     Estimate an expected NPV for each player graduating to the MLB level to quantify the end product of a player development department.
In order to satisfy these three goals, we first needed to find a reliable source of prospect grades that went far enough back in time and could be translated into dollars on a yearly basis. Fortunately, the The Baseball America Prospect Handbook has been grading a significant number of prospects (900) using the 20-80 scale on a per year basis since 2012, providing us with enough information to get started.

However, upon acquiring the aforementioned handbook, some heavy lifting was needed in order for us to use the data. First, Baseball America’s (BA) Prospect Handbook grades are only available in print, so we had to manually enter 2,700 prospect names, grades, and risk factors into a spreadsheet. Second, although Baseball America’s grades are published on the familiar 20-80 scale, their methods of assigning a prospect grade to a player are based on a “Realistic Ceiling” and “Risk Factor” calculation, rather than a traditional FV grade from which our NPV estimates are derived. As a result, we needed to adjust our BA grades to better align with our own fitted estimates of prospect value. To do this, we deducted 5 points from the Realistic Ceiling of every “High” risk profile prospect and 10 points from the Realistic Ceiling of every “Very High” and “Extreme” risk profile prospect.
To validate these conversions, we first looked at how many prospects had a higher adjusted grade than the prospect ranked above them (per BA) within a given organization. We found that out of 2,700 prospects within our sample, only 159 were out of order relative to their respective ranking.
With confidence that our prospect grades were accurate, we then matched our adjusted BA grades to Fangraphs’ “THEBOARD!” FV grades for the 1,092 prospects graded by both outlets from the 2017 season onwards.
As shown above, we obtained an R^2 value of .57 when comparing the two sets of prospect lists, with our adjusted BA grades coming in roughly 1.3 points higher than Fangraphs, on average, over every paired prospect in the sample. Of the 1,092 prospects in our sample, only 54 players had larger than a half-grade discrepancy between the two resources.
We interpreted these results as an indication that many of the discrepancies in prospect grades between the two resources were likely due to a difference in opinion, rather than an unreasonable grade adjustment on our part. Thus, we were comfortable using our adjusted BA grades for the remainder of our analysis.
With yearly prospect grades available to us for all relevant prospects from 2013 through 2019, we then set out to expand our database to include all minor leaguers and their respective signing bonuses received (with the exception of international free agents who signed at 25 years or older or those who started their professional career in AA or higher). As we explain a bit later, this data allowed us to generate a proxy of expected FV for every minor league prospect, as driven by the market, before they put on an affiliated uniform.
While obtaining signing-bonus data for every drafted player since 2012 was relatively straightforward, using publicly available resources to acquire every international free agent’s signing bonus was extremely challenging. To overcome these difficulties, we used a blend of resources including Baseball America, Sportrac, MLB.com, and The Baseball Cube to fill in as many values as possible.
(Note that we have more lenient requirements for Cuban-born players being included in our sample, which explains the discrepancy in dollars spent during 2015.)
In comparing the bonuses of international free agents (IFAs) within our database to Fangraphs fully populated dataset, we found that we were able to obtain information on roughly 24% of all international free agent signings from 2012 through 2017. While disappointing, our database still accounted for roughly 76% of all MLB IFA bonus expenditure during that time period, as well as every prospect graded 45 FV or higher by BA since 2012.
So, although we may be missing the vast majority of signings for $100,000 or less, we do have data on the vast majority of significant signings in a given season and every high-level prospect since 2012, which supplements the main focus of our analysis.
With this more complete dataset at our disposal, we obtained amateur FV grades from Fangraphs’ “THE BOARD” for every available prospect prior to their respective Rule 4 draft or July 2 signing window.
We then used our previously obtained signing-bonus data to generate three separate second order polynomials to predict FV grades for every prospect in our dataset based on when they were acquired, how they were acquired, and how much signing-bonus money they received.
Our first polynomial was built off of the 545 domestic amateur prospects graded by Fangraphs from 2015 through 2018. While this sample spans across two separate CBAs in which slot allotments towards the top end of the draft changed by a significant amount, we found insignificant differences in our results when splitting the players before and after the ratification of the new CBA. As a result, we elected to keep our sample together when building our regression.
To control for inflation, we normalized each player’s bonus total to be a proportion of all bonuses spent within each player’s respective draft. For example, in 2012, Carlos Correa received a $4.8M signing bonus that accounted for 2.45% of all bonus money spent during the 2012 draft, whereas in 2018, Joey Bart received $7.025M bonus that only accounted for 2.38% of all bonus money spent during the 2018 draft. Thus, as it relates to our model, Correa would actually be considered the more expensive acquisition compared to Bart, despite receiving an absolute bonus that was $2.2M cheaper.
Beyond just bonus money, we also considered a player’s pick number and whether he was a HS, 4YR, or JUCO product; however, none of these contextual factors added any significant predictive power to the model once bonus money was accounted for.
Our second and third polynomials were built using a split sample of 173 international free agents (IFA) graded from Fangraphs from 2015 through 2018. The splitting of the sample was designed to account for the wildly changing spending habits of teams due to the imposed limits on expenditure after the most recent CBA was ratified.
Controls were added to account for nation of origin; however, that information provided no significant predictive power to our model despite there being slight evidence of a premium on Cuban players within our sample, talent being held equal.
(The large signing bonuses of Cuban players seem to suppress the Predicted FV for IFAs from other major countries by a slight margin.)
Once values were fit to each prospect in our larger database, we chose to adjust for the super inflation that occurred in 2015 and 2016 due to impending spending limits by multiplying the 2012–2014 IFA class’ signing bonuses by 1.5. After this adjustment, the number of prospects with a fitted grade of 40 FV or higher for each respective IFA class are shown below.
(Our model was unable to handle Moncada’s signing bonus, so we manually assigned him a 60 grade upon signing.)
With fitted FV estimates for all players within our database, we rounded each value to the closest traditional grade in order to obtain an expected NPV for each prospect upon entering affiliated baseball.
For international players, any prospect that signed for under $250,000, after controlling for inflation, was designated as a non-prospect and received an NPV of $0. For domestic players, any prospect that signed for under $125,000 in 2017/2018 and $100,000 in 2012–2016 was also designated as a non-prospect and received an NPV of $0.
These constraints, while somewhat arbitrary, classified roughly 55% of all acquired prospects per year in our database as non-prospects. Since prior analysis has found that roughly 75%-80% of affiliated prospects are considered non-prospects, this figure was designed to accommodate the roughly 500-700 IFA non-prospects that were missing from our dataset on a per year basis.
(A snapshot of the first 10 picks of 2016 in our DB)
With a database containing expected NPV estimates and year-to-year changes in NPV for the vast majority of minor league players acquired since 2012, the final step in our methods was to account for prospects graduating to the MLB level.
Evaluating graduated prospects proved to be a more difficult task than initially perceived, as players who have reached the big leagues in our sample have not yet fulfilled their full 6+ years of club control. Making matters more challenging, publicly available multi-year projections of WAR tend to be unreliable and have relatively large disagreements on player evaluations.
As a result, we decided to go one by one and manually grade each graduated player based on his age, 2019 projected WAR, and previous MLB production.
Since these values comprise much of the value teams have generated over the past seven seasons, we wanted to be as transparent as possible. Thus, we have made all subjective grades used in this analysis available via the link provided here. Along with all of our MLB grades, you will also see a tab that instructs you on how to adjust each team’s final results for Value Generated, if you have any strong disagreements with our grading system. For example, if you believe that Kyle Freeland should have been a 60 FV upon graduating the big leagues, the link above provides you with the means to adjust the Rockies final values as you see necessary.
Beyond discrepancies in subjective grading, the tool linked above also allows you to adjust our final estimates of Value Generated based on hypothetical scenarios of an athlete’s development. For example, if you believe that Carlos Rodon would have been a 2.5 WAR player had he integrated his CH more effectively into his repertoire, you can adjust his final FV to a 55 and recalculate Chicago’s final values to account for this.
(A snapshot of the top 10 signees of the 2014 draft with MLB grades highlighted in gold)
Once a player relinquished prospect status, their MLB FV grade remained constant for the remaining duration of his career unless he switched organizations, established himself as an MiLB player again, and then proceeded to demonstrate a significantly different talent level upon reaching the Major Leagues with his new organization. In these specific cases, we wanted to credit the respective player development department that significantly improved a player’s overall talent level while the player was under their umbrella.
This exception was used sparsely, but it did allow us to account for players such as Max Muncy,  who, after accumulating -.7 fWAR over two seasons with the A’s, transformed himself into one of the premier power bats in the game since joining the Dodgers. Similar adjustments were applied to Chris Taylor with LAD, Caleb Smith with MIA, Matt Boyd with DET, and Tyler Olson with CLE.
(Both Chris Taylor and Max Muncy revitalized their playing careers after joining the Dodgers, a testament to the organization’s ability to acquire and develop talent over the past seven seasons. Ironically, Taylor and Muncy were drafted seven picks apart in the fifth round of the 2012 draft.)
With a complete database that included yearly changes in value for every acquired prospect in affiliated baseball since 2012, we were able to debit or credit each organization for the change in value, above or below expectation, for each prospect in their farm system signed after January 1, 2012.
(Mark Appel was rated a 55 FV prospect before entering Houston’s system as 2013’s first overall pick. After peaking as a 60 FV heading into 2015, his prospect status dropped to a 50 FV before he was traded to the Phillies prior to the 2016 season. With Appel now currently out of baseball, the Astros incurred a -$21.3M estimate of Value Generated for Appel’s development, whereas the Phillies incurred a -$25.9M estimate of Value Generated for realizing no return on an incoming 50 FV player.)
The table below shows our estimates for the raw value generated by each respective organization from 2012 through 2019.
At first glance, the position of many organizations relative to league average seems to align with what intuition would suggest. Teams at the top of the list—such as the Dodgers, Astros, Cardinals, Braves, and Yankees—have developed solid reputations as having either a strong scouting department, a strong player development department, or both. On the flipside, organizations near the bottom of the list have either found ways to build a contender without a homegrown core, or they have struggled to get talent to the majors at the rate we’d expect given their draft position, incoming talent via trades, and international free agent expenditure over the past seven years.
Aside from the order of where teams fall in this leaderboard, it is also fairly eye opening to see the absolute difference in Value Generated between the best and worst teams in terms of acquiring and developing players when controlling for incoming talent. While luck surely plays a significant factor in the $816M separating the Dodgers and White Sox in terms of Value Generated, it is telling that several of the organizations towards the bottom of our list have recently invested in many of the developmental tools the Dodgers and Astros have been using for years. All things considered, it is unlikely that only luck explains the differences in the values provided above and more work is needed to be done to quantify the true first mover’s advantage realized by the Dodgers and Astros.
After leveraging our newly constructed database to generate descriptive estimates for each organization’s ability to acquire and develop talent over the past seven seasons, preliminary findings suggest that we have developed a valid measurement of descriptive performance to disseminate the leaders from the laggards in terms of valuing and developing players at the minor league level.
With these promising initial results, part two of our mini-series will further investigate how teams are able to generate value throughout their minor league system, whether adding expected value to a prospect’s net worth significantly impacts the success of the big league team, and whether we can strip out luck to provide legitimate measures of an organization’s efficiency regarding player acquisition and development.
It would be interesting to look at prospects that started at some of the highly ranked development teams (ie: Dodgers) and see how players that left that organization and If they continued their success, got better or got worse.

Pairing Blast and Hittrax Data Part 2: Specific Focuses - Driveline Baseball,2019-04-14T03:01:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/04/pairing-blast-hittrax-data-part-2-specific-focuses/,"In our last piece, we took a surface level look at the first publicly available pairing of Blast and HitTrax data. In this piece, we take a look at commonly held, specific beliefs that have been touched upon by our hitting trainers and see whether the data backs it up. We also take a more nuanced view of a popular sabermetric proxy for evaluating attack angle via unsupervised learning.
Since our last post, we’ve added over 2000 sample swings of paired HitTrax and Blast data.
This piece includes a very granular examination of some very specific contentions, so to save time, here are the direct theses we are examining:
One final disclaimer: these findings are meant to be purely numerical with robust statistical merit rather than any sort of coaching indicator or lesson. The first three contentions are commonly believed both internally and among other analytically minded hitting instructors, and so now is the time to assess these claims.
A few quick definitions of the Blast metrics we discuss in this piece are necessary for comprehension:
Ok, with a few disclaimers and definitions out of the way, let’s roll up our sleeves.
Contention A has already been touched upon in the public Twittersphere.
Fires me up when @maxgordon40 hits me up with a theory about Early Connection Deg (Blast metric) and fires me up even more when his theory is validated by d@tA.
Gordo proposes that hitters with higher early connection deg’s in the top of the zone might have less productive BBEs pic.twitter.com/nAf4QNtW1k
— Alex Caravan (@Alex_Caravan) March 7, 2019
To touch back on this, this contention seems largely true. The mean early-connection figure for HHB or Hard-Hit Balls (measured here as EV over 90) is a little lower than for the non-HHB population for swings both in the bottom and top of the zone. So if anything, we can extend the contention to hold true for the rest of the zone, keeping in mind that the sweet spots are relative: What’s too high of an early-connection degree in the bottom of the zone is of greater money value in the top of the zone.
As a side note, the top and bottom of the zone was split up accordingly and depicted below:
The zone was additionally calibrated for each hitter’s height and stance, per HitTrax.
Athletes likely have high EV on pitches in the lower third of the zone and low EV on pitches in the top third of the zone (for connection_at_impact > 100).
First off, the similar scope of this question prompts us to recycle the same graphic.
So using the same top and bottom of the zone denotations, we now look at the kernel density (a smoothed depiction of a random variable’s probability density function, or just a fancy way to show where most of the variable’s values lie) of exit velocity (rather than investigating the swing-characteristic metric of early connection as we did in the previous contention) and split up our large data frame into four main subgroups:
It looks like there is a ~1.5 mph EV difference between the top and bottom of the zone when the connection at impact is above 100, but it looks like the gap widens when looking at the swing metrics under 100 degrees. In fact, when running a within-subject, one-factor variable ANOVA test (chosen for the singularity of the top/bottom zone factor, and the proliferation of multiple swings per 40+ different athletes), we see that the top/bottom factor is significant (with the p-value under null hypothesis F test registering < 0.000001) for swings under 100 degrees at connection of impact, whereas the subpopulation of swings with a higher connection at impact does not find the top/bottom denotation as being a significant explanatory variable for exit velocity (Pr(>F) = 0.32).
So, Contention B appears to be more valid when expanding its scope to the bottom of the zone as well.
Athletes take too long to reach peak rotational speed during swing and will likely struggle to achieve high EV at deeper points of contact (for rotational_acceleration_<15).
Here, we’re varying three continuous metrics: rotational acceleration, point of impact depth, and exit velocity.
Having a lower rotational acceleration does seem to make it more difficult to achieve higher exit velocity at deeper points of contact—as well as at every other common point of contact. An examination of a few density plots of the two rotational acceleration populations seems to bear this out. But first, let’s look at three steadily deeper and more selective samples:
And then let’s consider a comparison at a shallow point of contact where the hitter is over two and a half feet out in front:
If anything, it looks like rotational acceleration becomes even more pivotal if the hitter is very out in front. Well there’s a happy takeaway: A higher rotational acceleration seems to speak dividends no matter where a hitter makes contact.
The 1/8th rule average LA makes for a suitable proxy for attack angle on a macro scale (per hitter).
First, here is a little bit of explanation, since this may be a new theory to some. The idea (touched upon first here by Tom Tango and here in a community Fangraphs piece) implies that gathering a hitter’s hard-hit batted balls average launch angle is an appropriate benchmark for representing a hitter’s average attack angle. (A general proxy has been cited as the top eighth of hard-hit balls to serve as the said “hard hit batted balls” subgroup.) Now, this comparison has been analyzed and constructed roughly through thorough swing-mechanic reverse engineering, but now we have the chance to attempt to validate this method.
We have approximately 45 different hitters in our dataset but keeping in only those who have at least 40 batted ball events (so as to deal away with some small sample size snarkiness) leaves us with 39.
Then, we constructed three different attack angle proxies versus the actual average attack angle per hitter, and we calculated a few error results (mean absolute deviation and root mean square error) as well as a directional indicator of reliability (the ubiquitious R-squared).
Specifically, the proxies were computed as the following:
These are fairly interesting results. Preferably, I would have also used the median LA as a proxy metric, but in this situation, with HitTrax representing launch angle as whole integers rather than float decimals, there wasn’t a discernable difference between the median and mean values.
The real (as measured by HitTrax) attack angle has a magnitude difference with all off the proxies (a 5-degree difference with the second method and a ~8 degree difference with the third, combo method) but looks quite directionally reliable with strong correlation values. The combo method specifically looks very promising, given awareness of the magnitude difference—and to be fair, for most analysis purposes in the scope of comparison, both of intra- and inter-nature, directional reliability could well be much more valuable than a strict low RMSE or the like. Here’s a visual representation of the combo method plotted via the actual average attack angle of each individual hitter:
Now, more contentions will come soon as we fold in both Rapsodo Hitting (tons of exciting batted-ball spin explorations) and some synced K-Vest data as well. For those of you that made it to the bottom of this, congrats! The diamonding will continue in the next piece of synced batted-ball and swing-data exploration.

The Value in Developing Velocity in the Minors - Driveline Baseball,2019-04-05T03:58:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/04/value-developing-velocity-minors/,"In part one of The Business Case For Player Development series, we calculated prospect valuations for top tier minor leaguers and validated those estimates by looking at several trades throughout MLB. Building on that work, we use those valuations in this post to model the net-present value of improving prospects by providing them with an individualized training program. Through this analysis, we quantify how much money organizations leave on the table by not getting their pitchers fully equipped with a custom training plan based on a thorough assessment.
With front offices expanding and marketplaces becoming more efficient, professional baseball has become a copycat industry, of sorts. Successful teams have seen their employees poached and ideas copied, all in an attempt by competitors to nullify a team’s perceived advantage as quickly as it is capitalized on.
With this in mind, it is not surprising that more teams have begun heavily investing in player development after witnessing the Houston Astros’ rise from laughing stock to perennial contender. Taboo only a few years ago, Rapsodo units and Edgertronic cameras are now commonplace in one of baseball’s last frontiers where low-hanging fruit still exists—the backfields.
While the inclusion of flashy technology to develop pitches is certainly a welcome change in a stubborn industry, it has the potential to cause one to overlook the single most important attribute to a pitcher’s success: velocity.
For example, despite teams investing more money into technology, it is still common practice for them to prescribe cookie-cutter throwing programs that cater to an unrelenting minor-league schedule before the specific needs of the individual.
By failing to provide players with an individually designed throwing program based on personalized assessment, teams inevitably fall short in designing an optimal development plan for their pitchers.
Using in-gym data from Driveline and several MLB metrics to isolate the relationship between changing velocities and future production, we quantify how much this suboptimal behavior costs teams in terms of Net Present Value (NPV).
To set the baseline for our analysis, we first need to look at whether we can significantly improve the velocity of professional pitchers using a data-driven assess-train-reassess model.
To address this, we gathered data on 58 high-level athletes who went through our velocity development program within the past 18 months. All players averaged at least 88 mph on their fastballs during their initial mound velocity, were 19 years or older at the time of their assessments, and trained at Driveline for at least three weeks. The cumulative averages of the athletes who met this criteria are provided below:
Now, developing velocity is not a linear process and not every athlete is guaranteed to see results. To gain a better feel for what the distribution of the changes in velocity were for each pitcher in our sample, we binned outcomes in .5 mph increments and smoothed the buckets by frequencies:
As shown above, 41.95% of all athletes in our subset gained at least 1 mph from entry to exit mound velocity, whereas only 18.39% of athletes lost over 1 mph.
Thus, despite arguments from days gone by, it’s clear that velocity levels can increase over time by instituting proper training methods in a pitcher’s routine. With this finding, we can show that even small increases in velocity have positive effects in production and overall value.
While improving velocity is a net positive, it’s important to acknowledge that velocity alone does not get batters out. So, if we are interested in quantifying how an uptick or downtick in velocity impacts a player’s projected net value to an organization, we must consider a pitcher’s entire projection in the process.
To do that, we turned to the publicly available Steamer Projections system, which has been providing yearly MLB pre-season projections for fastball velocity (FBv) and RA9 (or at least runs and innings pitched) since 2013.
The idea in this exercise is simple; we controlled for changing run environments on a year-to-year basis and found the difference between projected FBv and actual FBv (min 50 IP) as well as projected RA9 and actual RA9 for each individual pitcher at the MLB level. We expected that a pitcher who threw his fastball slower than expected in a given season would have worse outcomes than previously projected, and vice versa.
This relationship is exactly what we found over a sample of 1,838 athletes. More specifically, a pitcher who out performed his fastball velocity projection by +1 mph produced an RA9 that was .2443 points lower than expected, on average.
(This chart shows that as velocity increases above expectations, ERA, RA9, and FIP all decrease while K% increases.)
To scale this finding to WAR, we took a hypothetical player, held his IP constant at 75 (a hedge between a starter and reliever), and calculated his WAR before and after a .2443 point reduction in RA9. We found that adding 1 mph to a player’s FBv increased the expected production of said player by ~.25-.35 WAR per season, depending on whether he was a starter or reliever.
With estimates that relate changes in velocity to changes in performance, Kiley McDaniel’s scouting scale provides us with a link between the expected production level of a prospect at maturation (WAR) and his overall prospect grade (FV).
For most noteworthy prospects, McDaniels estimated that a .5 WAR change in projected talent level coincided with a half-grade increase or decrease in FV. Thus, we can deduce that a +2 mph increase in FB velocity causes a player’s talent level to increase by ~.5 wins and 5 points in FV.
The process here is generally straightforward. Say, for example, we have a 50 FV prospect that averaged 92 mph on his FB last season and gained 2 mph during the most recent off-season. Given the findings above, we would expect that this prospect’s projected RA9 would drop by ~.5 points due to the increase in velocity. Over the course of the season, we estimate this to be worth ~.5 WAR of production, which would boost his yearly projection from 2 WAR/year to 2.5 WAR/year. Using the chart above, this change in production would be the equivalent of moving his grade from 50 FV to 55 FV.
Since we now have a link between throwing harder and production from an individual standpoint, we next set out to apply this finding on an organizational level. This allows us to determine how much a league-average farm system could improve their overall production level if they provided their top prospects with a customized throwing plan.
To gain a proxy of a league-average farm system, we obtained both the number and quality of pitching prospects graded 40 FV and above for systems ranked 12th – 18th from 2016 to 2018 by Fangraphs.
The selected farm systems contained an average of approximately 13 pitchers with a grade of 40 or higher. The distribution of grades for these prospects is shown in the table below:
With these frequencies at our disposal, we created a multinomial simulation that generated 13,000 pseudo pitching prospects across 1,000 “league-average” farm systems. These prospects were designed to be representative of a prototypical pitching prospect that had only been exposed to traditional throwing programs in their past.
(The graph above shows the average grade of a corresponding prospect rank within each farm system.)
To apply the impact that Driveline’s throwing program could have on these generated prospects, we created an additional multinomial simulation by using the results from our velocity development program to find expected changes in their velocity via our program. By linking changes in velocity with a coinciding change in future value, we obtained a before and after snapshot of future value for each prospect after having gone through a Driveline program.
We converted these FV grades to NPV values and then averaged the change in surplus value for each farm system before and after the Driveline throwing program. From our experiment, it was found that an organization increased the NPV of their farm system by approximately $38 million after having their prospects go through a velocity development program. This is roughly the equivalent of adding a 55-FV prospect to a farm system or having two 45-FV prospects jump to a 50 FV.
(Above is a hypothetical farm system both before and after the Driveline throwing program.)
While a $38 million estimate might be a little eye opening initially, we believe that this estimate is likely inflated by a few shortcomings in our initial methods that need to be addressed.
First, our initial methods do not consider that some prospects would have likely seen changes in their velocity had they just continued with their traditional throwing program. In other words, hypothetical prospects went through a Driveline throwing program and either gained or lost velocity based on the expected results of our program. The control group, however, had their velocity stay the same despite the fact that they would have been training as well. Thus, this needs to be accounted for.
Second, although the sample of players used to build our Driveline throwing program simulator was comprised of many professional athletes, the average player within our sample was not representative of a 45-FV prospect or higher. As a result, our initial estimate is likely biased upwards because higher-level prospects are more likely to be closer to their velocity ceiling than those in our sample. This makes marginal velocity gains for top prospects more difficult to obtain than our simulation led to believe.
(Graphic above is taken from our Summer 2018 Pitching Analysis)
To adjust for both of these shortcomings, we regressed our initial results by 25% and threw out any prospects in our sample graded 45 FV or higher. While both somewhat arbitrary concessions, we think these additional steps tackle both limitations head on.
For example, in regressing our changes in NPV by 25%, we acknowledge that pitchers can either develop or lose velocity by sticking with a more traditional program. That said, we also recognize that changes in velocity are likely to be less volatile for players using traditional training methods than for players using unfamiliar training modalities.
In removing any prospects graded 45 or higher, we remove a subset of pitchers that predominantly already throw hard and have had large amounts of success training with traditional methods. Furthermore, this subset of prospects would likely have more jurisdiction over their own program, and thus they might be less likely to follow through on a new training stimulus that is foreign to them.
With only 40-grade pitching prospects remaining within our hypothetical sample of athletes, we repeat the same methodology as described above and regress the changes in NPV for each farm system by 25%. With these adjustments, the average change in NPV for each farm system drops down to ~$11 million with a wide distribution that is skewed leftward.
This conservative $11 million estimate is still a large sum of money that most teams have not cashed in on, and it does not consider other elements of value that individualized throwing programs provide teams, which we will address in future pieces.
For example, the methods above do not give individualized throwing programs to prospects graded 35 FV and below, who constitute 80-85% of all Minor League Baseball players. This subset of players should be able leverage their individualized programs more so than top prospects, given that they benefit the most from increasing outcome volatility. The same can be said for AAAA players who are heading into the final stages of their careers and high profile prospects labeled as projectable, whose value is predicated on improving velocity.
The estimate above also does not consider the value of programming daily warm-up and recovery modalities in preventing injuries, which keeps players on the field longer and mitigates significant rehab costs for organizations in the long run.
Given the influx of dollars now being spent on player development, it is clear that giving pitchers a development plan that addresses their individual deficiencies and helps develop velocity has a massive ROI for organizations. The reason for this is straightforward: the upside of increasing the volatility of outcomes for 40-FV prospects and lower will always outweigh the risk.
Rather than having these players continue to accrue 25 starts season after season, perhaps it is time teams re-evaluate and provide their athletes with a plan that is going to make them more likely to reach their goal of making it to the big leagues.
After all, it has been about 10 years since we learned that when you gain a tick, you lose one, so how long will it be before teams decide to put this research into practice?

"Injury Risk, Performance, and Velocity - Driveline Baseball",2019-03-28T04:19:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/03/injury-risk-performance-velocity/,"It’s fairly common to watch a game these days, see a pitcher throw 99 mph, and hear the reaction of fans be a mix of amazement and fear: amazement that certain pitchers can throw that hard, and fear that it’s unsafe and an injury is guaranteed.
Given the many misconceptions and unknowns related to velocity, this article focuses on all things velocity by taking a deep dive into what the research says about injury risk and performance.
We first look at the history of studies that try to find risk factors for UCL tears and increased torque values in baseball pitching. We see that increased velocity is typically associated as a risk factor for injury, but there are still some gaps in the research that need to be filled in.
We then look at some new research that filled some of the previous research gaps. We take a wide look at what that means and what should be researched in the future.
Lastly, we discuss the performance benefits of throwing hard and look at how the research can be balanced with the performance benefits.
With shoulder injuries decreasing and elbow injuries increasing, many have turned to velocity as the culprit (Conte, Camp & Dines, 2016) because we have seen an increase in velocity in the major leagues over the last few seasons. Some pitchers may be throwing harder as they age, but teams are also replacing older pitchers (who throw at lower velocities) with younger players who throw harder and pitch in shorter spurts. These effects can be seen when looking at velocity aging curves and yearly velocity trends over time.
Given this perceived link between velocity and injury, there has been a lot of research looking at fastball velocity and injury rate. We’ve briefly summarized the research as much as possible and arranged the list in order of the year that each piece was published.
Unlike the studies summarized above, which have all found links between higher velocities and inflated injury risks, Keller et al. (2016) found that MLB pitchers who needed UCL surgery did not pitch at higher velocities than matched controls. Instead, the researchers found that pitchers who threw a higher percentage of fastballs were at heightened risk for injury. While interesting, this finding is somewhat peculiar considering previous research and the fact that one often assumes that pitchers who throw harder also throw their fastballs more frequently.
An important aspect to note when reading the research above is that they are all correlating velocity to injury risk, but fail to consider torque. Many of the articles state, in some form or another, that velocity is likely linked to higher torques on the arm, which is why they see a relationship between velocity and injury.
While velocity isn’t the only factor, it is a theme that keeps coming up as a risk factor for injury. It may be easy to assume that higher velocities always mean higher elbow torques, but the relationship between the two hasn’t always been very clear.
There are also some confounding factors that need to be mentioned:
Selection bias is an issue. There isn’t a sample of pitchers with the same demands throwing in the mid 70s or mid 80s. The closest comparison would be high school and college athletes, but they are not as physically developed, and their seasons are more varied and shorter than the major league season.
Workload is another factor that comes to mind, as many of the studies listed above mention days between outings as a factor. DeFroda et al. found that more UCL injuries occurred earlier in the year and that there can be differences between starting and relieving.
These studies also largely looked at the averages, but it would be interesting to look at the distribution of injuries in larger velocity buckets as well. For example, would possible injury risk increase as velocity increased if buckets of 90-92, 92-94, 94-96 were compared? Or would we see that injury risk increases after a certain point, say 94 mph, and then level off even at increased velocities?
It’s also important to point out that the significance between velocities was relatively small—with the exception being Bushnell et al. (2010) which only looked at one pitch during a spring training start. (Pitchers can experience lower velocities in spring training as they build up work capacity for the season.)
Many studies also tend to look at raw torque numbers that are not normalized to height and weight, meaning taller pitchers will have higher torque values in part because their limbs are longer. There is also little research on what the muscles are doing during the throw. Since we’ve seen torques on the elbow can handle what cadavers are able to handle, the muscles of the arm play a key role in staying healthy.
There have been previous research studies published on both college and high school pitchers that have examined the specific relationship between velocity and elbow torque. Especially relevant with the increase in injuries at those levels, researchers have found a relationship between velocity and elbow torque, but have disagreed about the strength of the relationship.
For example, Hurd et al. (2012) found a positive association between ball velocity and elbow-varus torque (r^2 = 0.373, P<0.01) when looking at 26 high school pitchers. However, the average velocity of the pitchers within their sample was 71 mph, which is quite low.
Building off of these findings, Post et al. (2015) looked at a larger and older sample of 67 collegiate pitchers who averaged an 83.5 mph on their fastball, but didn’t find a significant correlation between ball velocity and elbow-varus torque.
A major reason why researchers have traditionally found such inconsistent results when attempting to link velocity, torque, and injury together is that their methods almost always look at group-wide averages and compare a wide range of pitchers. We believe that this causes them to overlook velocity’s relationship to torque at the individual level. How an individual experiences throwing harder is arguably more important than a group-level analysis, given that each pitcher has his own physiological attributes that influences results.
New research gives us a great look at how different the data can appear when comparing pitchers to each other instead of comparing them to themselves, which is why the recent paper Fastball Velocity and Elbow-Varus Torque in Professional Baseball Pitchers by Slowik et al. is so important.
Slowik et al.’s data was collected via a retrospective review of ASMI’s database. That is, ASMI looked back through their database and included all pitchers who threw at least 5 fastballs and had a velocity range of 5 mph. To avoid outliers, no single pitch accounted for more than half the velocity range. They ended up analyzing 64 pitchers (52 righties and 12 lefties whose average velocity ranged from 71 to 96 mph) by normalizing elbow torque to body weight and height so that they could better compare the pitchers to each other.
They found that when they looked at the group of pitchers, velocity only explained 7.6% of variance in elbow torque. However, when they looked at individual pitchers, velocity explained 95.7% of the variance.
These findings can be summed up in two main ideas:
One interesting note about this finding is that we saw something similar years ago when looking at pitchers with the Motus sleeve.
2. If you take one pitcher and have him throw harder, he will experience more torque on his elbow.
Of course, in Slowik et al.’s study, there were a few exceptions to this. While the full data set was not made available in the paper, the chart in the paper showing the relationships between normalized elbow torque and velocity saw some individuals stand out. A few pitchers saw no change in torque as they threw harder, while one or two actually saw a decrease as they threw harder.
In a perfect world, we would have this biomechanical data available to go with performance metrics to make personalized recommendations for pitchers. Since we don’t have that information available, we need to stay with the idea that the harder a pitcher throws, the more stress on his elbow he’ll experience. (We explain the nuance of that statement in the next section.)
So, when you’re watching a pitcher throw at the high end of his velocity spectrum, you can assume that he is experiencing higher levels of torque than usual. But that does not mean he is experiencing high levels of torque overall.
It’s unknown what intent level the pitchers were throwing at in Slowik et al. Although it may seem like a small difference, we aren’t sure if the results in this study would apply to pitchers throwing at max effort.
Drawing from Slowik et al., there are three ways that we could see results if we were only looking at pitchers throwing as hard as they could.
As mentioned above, all three of these examples were seen in individual pitcher comparisons. The question worth answering is which of the three theories best represents throwing at 90, 95, 100% intensity, or whether is it still a combination of the three, similar to the research above.
We can look elsewhere for hints. Research looking at wider levels of intent off the mound found fairly stark differences in how velocity and torque changed (Slenker et al., 2014).
In a similar theme as above, we saw that pitchers could drop 10 mph when comparing pitching to flat ground, but only see a decrease of 3 Nm of elbow torque when using the Motus sleeve.
We’ve also seen pitchers increase velocity with no statistically significant increase in torque when they pulldown. Pulldowns are the closest thing we have to a maximum intent throw.
The differences in the stress metric between ASMI and the Motus sleeve can be explained in our validation paper on the Motus sleeve.
So we’ve seen that torques outpace intent level at low intent on the mound, that large decreases in velocity on flat-ground throws results in small decreases in torques, and that large increases in velocity while throwing with a running start results in small increases in torques. So, depending on the intent level and throwing drill, torque has been shown to have a nonlinear relationship with velocity.
Research looking specifically at pitchers throwing at the higher range of intent on the mound will give us an idea on how that torque changes.
However, regardless of the throwing modality, what we see is that velocity is a risk factor for injuries in professional pitchers because it is likely that the harder one pitcher throws, the more torque he experiences. Though, we don’t yet know whether the relationship between velocity and torque changes at the highest level of intent. Because ASMI looked back retroactively, and we see that athletes tend to throw slower when they are markered up, pitchers may have likely downregulated to throwing at a lower than game-like intensity.
So, this means that players who throw harder experience higher torques and that’s why they get injured, right? That’s a good guess, and it is definitely a factor, but there is some nuance to that statement.
The most interesting question after looking at this research is which matters more: the raw torque number or the relative torque number? Let’s elaborate.
There is a good amount of research pointing to higher velocities being a risk factor for injury. New research shows that it’s difficult to compare torque among pitchers, but as one pitcher throws harder, he’ll experience more stress. For the first point, we used the example that a pitcher throwing 91 mph could have the same stress as a pitcher throwing 95 mph. What also is true is you could have multiple pitchers throw 95 mph and have a variety of stresses.
Looking at Slowik et al., the mean value for normalized max elbow-varus torque was 5.33% ± 0.74% body weight x height. (The torque values were normalized to height and weight for better comparison.) The full data set isn’t available, but you can narrow in at a specific velocity and see a variety of torques.For example, if we use 42 m/s (93 mph) as an example, we can see normalized torques at 4.7%, 4.8%, 5.4%, and 6.7%. This is similar, in theme, to what we saw using the Motus sleeve a few years ago. Multiple pitchers can throw at the same velocity with different torques.
mStress is further explained here.
So, the question is: Does the pitcher who throws at 4.7% normalized torque have the same risk level as the pitcher throwing at 6.7% normalized torque? Does the pitcher throwing 93 mph at 60 Nm torque have the same injury risk as the pitcher throwing 93 mph at 85 Nm? This is important because we’ve seen many more correlations between velocity and injury than torque and injury.
We’ve seen velocity correlated to injury but we’ve also seen pitchers can have different torque levels at the same velocity, so what does that say about the relationship between injury and torque?
There is also more nuance involved than just torque measurements alone. Normalized torque may be better to compare than raw numbers, but we’ve also seen in several studies that workload, days rest, and throwing volume all play a role in influencing injury risk as well.
One study was able to link pitchers that experience higher levels of torque with increased likelihood of injury, but there were some serious limitations with the methods. The paper used hi-speed video cameras to get measure the biomechanics of 23 pitchers during one Spring Training game and then followed their injury history for three years after. The trend between elbow injury and higher torque was fairly significant (P= .0547), but they did see a significant correlation between elbow injury and higher elbow-valgus torque. The only issue with these findings is getting accurate torque measures from a multi-camera setup, and not a marker system, is incredibly challenging because it’s not yet been fully validated in baseball pitching.
For example, it’s difficult to find body landmarks while a player is wearing a uniform, and there is limited validation work between markered-based measurements and camera-based measurements for high-speed movements. It is speculated that a camera-based system could likely obtain accurate body positions at certain points, but it would have added difficulty calculating accurate torque measures when compared to markered-based labs because of an inability to measure rotation, and they can lose body positions as a uniform moves.
(Note: We run a marker based lab with Optitrack cameras and have recently partnered with KinaTrax markerless camera system to validate a markered-based lab to non-markered in order to see which measures are accurate.)
Therefore, we can conclude that velocity is still an injury risk factor and the harder one pitcher throws he’ll likely have higher elbow torque, but we still don’t know if higher normalized torque matters more or if pitchers are at similar risk levels throwing at their own higher torque. There is still more research needed in that area, especially for pitchers throwing at high intent. This is also looking strictly at velocity and not including mobility, strength, workload, and mechanics as other factors that could lead to higher risk of injury.
Given the link in research and general belief that throwing harder is more dangerous, it is often suggested by both fans and researchers that pitchers should just throw slower. We’re going to investigate whether that is a realistic strategy and what the consequences of decreasing velocity could be for a pitcher in terms of performance.
Again referencing the new ASMI study, it was recommended that pitchers should vary their velocities, because the more they try to throw at high intent, the higher torques they’re experiencing. Anecdotally, some hitters have said varying velocities makes hitting specific pitchers more difficult; however, the numbers behind this theory are lacking. You may also find pitchers who say they “vary” their velocities in the sense that they don’t throw at 100% effort all the time, but this strategy does not hold true for all pitchers, and there is no evidence that this strategy improves performance.
The ASMI authors supported their recommendations by looking at pitchers who qualified for the ERA title from 2015 to 2017 and the relationship between velocity and certain metrics. They found that higher velocities in pitchers resulted in lower seasonal outputs in ERA and WHIP, and subsequently higher seasonal outputs in fWAR and bWAR as well. With older, amateur research seeing similar relationships between velocity and K/9 in both starters and relievers, there’s evidence to support that velocity and performance are closely tied together.
However, the ASMI researchers instead concluded that velocity had a weak correlation with measures of performance, given that the r^2 values reported for each of the aforementioned performance metrics ranged from 0.034 to 0.158. These numbers contain a large amount of selection bias and would likely be different if relievers were included in some way. Requiring 162 innings means that there would be less variation in ERA or WAR because the pitchers who do throw that many innings are already very good or very lucky.
We also still have to remember that velocity is also treated as a floor, and further, we don’t know what exactly makes good pitchers successful in the first place.
Other academic research has examined what metrics correlate best to FIP. In a study by Whiteside et al. (2016) it was found that ball speed was one of three main factors in predicting FIP, but that it was also only able to explain 22% of the variance in FIP, suggesting that velocity is a big factor in performance, but there are still plenty of unknowns.
Interpreting how important velocity contributes to performance also comes down to differences in ERA, FIP, or whichever metrics you use to define “successful” performance in the first place. Since we don’t currently know of any model that can explain close to 100% of the variance in seasonal pitching performance, the scale is different than in other research. Complicating matter even more, metrics like ERA have low reliability year to year because they include a large amount of luck. That is why metrics like FIP, xFIP, and SIERA were created in an attempt to get a better understanding of how a pitcher is actually performing.
It would be different if we saw a larger range of fastball velocities in the major leagues, but we see few pitchers with fastballs below 90 mph. The pitchers who do fall below that range tend to be older and above average in other areas. The fact is that pitching is complex, and being a successful pitcher involves being good at multiple skills: throwing above the velocity floor, having adequate command, having at least one good secondary pitch (more than that for starters), and quality movement of all pitches, to name a few. Zack Greinke has even gone out of his way to show how important the velocity floor is for pitchers.
Greinke tweet
The possible benefits of not throwing at high velocity is often explained in a less than straightforward way, besides the supposed health benefits. General anecdotes (usually of pitchers who are older or already incredibly good) are used as examples that pitchers can be successful at lower velocities, which may broadly be true, but may not be true to you. The sample is also skewed since nobody sees pitchers with low velocity, bad command, and bad “stuff.” Those are often the first pitchers eliminated from the pool of possible pitchers.
Being successful at (relatively) lower velocities as a pitcher is less of a conscious choice and more of a series of “if, then” statements.
IF, you have above average fastball spin rate and high vertical movement…
IF, you have standout movement…
IF, you have above average control of multiple pitches…etc.
….THEN you can be successful at relatively lower velocities.
None of those mention possible mechanical differences of throwing at lower intent, which is something that may be further expanded on in further research.
This is in essence what Mike Fast wrote about on Hardball Times in his article “Lose a Tick, Gain a Tick” in 2010. Pitchers who throw harder see a decrease in runs allowed per inning, and pitchers who throw on the lower end of the fastball velocity spectrum are often exceptional in other areas.
Asking pitchers to throw slower often means asking them to give away a competitive advantage for an unmeasurable and unknowable gain in health, which they might not be able to benefit from because throwing at lower velocity could mean worse statistics and a shorter career.
Many of the examples of pitchers having success with a lack of velocity can likely be attributed to confirmation bias and not because a statistical analysis showed an advantage. In fact, many front-office members would tell you that the injury issue is complicated and that velocity is one of, if not the most, important things for a pitcher.

Velocity is still seen as a huge benefactor, even when the straight correlations may be less than impressive. Giving hitters less time to react to a pitch is a good thing.
There was a lot to cover in this article, and while we know a bit more about the relationship between velocity and injury risk, there are still some unknowns. As always, it helps to look at all the things we do and don’t know.
What we know
What we don’t know: The exact relationship between injury and torque
That is, if three pitchers throw 95 mph with different torque, are they all at the same injury risk because of mph? Or are they different because of mechanics and other factors?
None of the research on velocity and injury risk makes velocity less important. Similar to other professional sports, baseball pitchers are pushing their bodies to their limits. They are going to incur a higher risk than an average Joe playing in a rec league.
This makes managing other factors so much more important because we want to get pitchers to throw hard while managing their risk. Managing mobility, strength and workload all matter greatly to every pitcher, especially to those who are either trying to maximize or maintain a high level of velocity.

How We Interpret Biomechanics Reports - Driveline Baseball,2019-03-23T04:04:06+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/03/interpret-biomechanics-reports/,"In our previous biomechanics post, we looked at the data we had collected over the past six months. We looked at the averages of key metrics and what metrics correlate to velocity and torques on the arm. But we didn’t really look at how we interpret a biomechanics report for our athletes.
When designing our report, we realized that there can be an overwhelming amount of information. It’s a lot to go through, even for someone with a trained eye. But an athlete understanding his biomechanics report is a vital piece in understanding what he needs to do to get better.
This means we spent a lot of time refining our report to be as readable and comprehensible as possible. To this day, we continue to improve our report as we learn more and more about the biomechanics of pitching.
The end result is a six-page report that looks at positional metrics, velocity metrics, sequencing, and joint kinetics—or forces and torques on the arm. From our internal database of motion-capture data, we have set normative ranges that we then use to assess and interpret what changes we need to make to an athlete’s mechanics.
In this post we examine an athlete’s biomechanics report and address what sort of changes we would like to make. We won’t look at every single metric; we will just run through the red flags and explain how our trainers would use that information to make specific training recommendations.
This page is straightforward. Topical data, like the date of the capture and the athlete’s height and weight, are listed, and the three pictures shown are taken of the athlete at MER in Visual3D.
Definitions of the key events the report looks at are listed as well.
The second page of the report looks at joint angles at key positions in the throwing arm, what we define as the arm action.
We’ve already examined one element of this page in a previous article, namely looking at shoulder abduction: the angle between the line of the shoulders and the upper arm. Ideally, we like to see the abduction path stay relatively close to 90 degrees, or neutral with the shoulders. Too high or too low could indicate arm drag or elbow climb.
Looking at the report here, we see that this athlete has a shoulder abduction at foot plant of 103 degrees and a maximum of 135 degrees, which is more than 40 degrees higher than our in-gym average! That means our guy has a drastic amount of elbow climb—not the most efficient arm path.
The next thing we look at is shoulder horizontal abduction, which is how we quantify scap retraction or scap load. A positive number indicates that the elbow is behind the line of his shoulders; a negative number indicates the elbow is in front. A good scap load looks something like this:
Looking back at our athlete’s report, we see he has 3.76 degrees of scap retraction at foot plant (average is roughly 40 degrees), and only 4.83 degrees maximum (average is roughly 57 degrees), which are both far below average.
So we’re seeing excessive elbow climb and a lack of scap retraction. To put it another way, instead of the elbow travel backwards into scap retraction, it travels upwards as the elbow hikes up. This gives us a more precise measurement of how a pitcher is moving, which provides our pitching trainers with more specific information to use to help make a change.
So how do we fix this?
We go to our bread and butter arm action drill: the Pivot Pickoff. More specifically, we have the athlete focus on driving the elbow backwards. With this particular athlete, we also added in Scap-Retraction Throws to really focus on cuing the elbow backwards to improve that scap retraction.
The third page of the report focuses on midsection and lower body positions.
Here we note things like if the athlete stays closed and stacked, if the athlete generates good hip/shoulder separation, or if the athlete has a good lead-leg block.
For our athlete, everything looks pretty good. A negative trunk angle and negative forward trunk tilt at foot plant indicates that he stays stacked and closed, and he generates nearly 48 degrees of hip/shoulder separation, which some might call elite.
We do see 48 degrees of lateral trunk tilt at ball release, which in our last biomechanics article we found could be linked with higher torques on the arm. In this case, we can explore what the root cause of the excessive trunk tilt is.
When lateral trunk tilt occurs early in the delivery, there are several factors that may contribute. It’s worth further assessing hip mobility and strength, as a lack of either of these can result in postural shifts that affect trunk positioning. From our mobility screening, we can see if hip mobility or hip strength could be a limiting factor. Or maybe the athlete just isn’t strong enough to hold himself in position. All these factors need to be considered when making a mechanical change—it isn’t just as simple as forcing an athlete to move differently.
Lastly, looking at front knee flexion, we see that the athlete doesn’t collapse on the lead leg and is very slightly extending it by about three degrees. But looking at the graph, we see that after foot plant, the athlete sinks into the lead leg a bit before starting to push back, indicating a slight inefficiency in the lead leg. Ideally, we would like to see the knee continually extend after foot plant, indicating a clear sign for improvement.
The fourth page of the report looks at the kinematic velocities of the thrower.
We note that the athlete has above average pelvis and torso rotation speeds as well as average arm speeds (elbow-extension angular velocity and shoulder internal rotation velocity).
We also see that his maximum lead-knee extension velocity (how fast the angle of the knee changes) is 242 deg/s which is below our target of ~350 deg/s. This fact, coupled with the notes above, indicate that our athlete has a subpar lead-leg block—which we noted in our previous biomechanics article has a significant correlation to throwing velocity.
The fifth page of the report looks at the kinematic sequencing of the athlete.
Although there is still very little we know about sequencing and timing, we do have a couple of things we can glean from this page.
The timing of peak-pelvis angular velocity to peak-torso angular velocity has been shown to be significantly correlated to pitching velocity. Our athlete has an average of 0.0389 seconds, which is pretty good.
Other studies have examined the time from foot plant to max external rotation and into ball release, but we have yet to see any significant correlations to velocity with those timings.
This carries into the second thing we can examine: the graph. The colored arrows correspond to when the maximum values of each metric occur. As has been talked about before, we like to see those peaks happen from the ground up: Pelvis → Torso → Elbow → Shoulder.
Speeds of each segment: red is minimum speed, green is maximum speed
The last page of the report looks at elbow shoulder kinetics—namely elbow varus torque and shoulder internal rotation torque.
We look at three sets of torques: total torque (Nm), torque normalized for height and weight (%), and miles per hour per normalized torque (mph/ %).
We note that across the board our thrower is worse than our average thrower. He has more torque on his shoulder and elbow, even when normalizing for height and weight, and gets fewer miles per hour per unit of stress than our average thrower. Not ideal.
Now does that mean that we need to shut our thrower down because he could be more prone to injury? Absolutely not.
The calculated loads on the elbow and shoulder are the total loads on those joints, but there is no insight into the underlying muscles and how they work to protect a pitcher. Simply put, there is no insight into the actual torque on the UCL or any other ligament. Just because somebody has higher torques doesn’t necessarily mean he is more likely to get injured. There are a lot of factors at play.
Perhaps the most useful thing we can take from this page is the ability to track torques and velocity-torque efficiency over time. We can retest an athlete after he has made mechanical improvements and track any changes to the resultant forces on the elbow and shoulder. We can test an athlete before and after a season to see what kinematic and kinetic changes have occurred over the course of the year.
These changes are largely unexplored for us, and as we collect more longitudinal data, we can hopefully start to answer the questions surrounding what mechanical changes actually result in less stress and more efficient mechanics.
With notes in hand, we sent our athlete away to train. Our trainer will be able to look at this information, along with an athlete’s strength and mobility assessment, to put together a plan.
After a couple of months, we were able to do a retest in the biomechanics lab, where we saw significant changes to his arm action—all for the good. There was less elbow climb and more scap retraction, and we even saw slight reductions in the joint forces on his elbow and shoulder, despite throwing the same ball velocity.
This is where the real value of motion capture lies, especially for elite throwers where the mechanical discrepancies can be tiny. By routinely taking thumbprints of our athletes, we can test and retest to see what training improvements contribute to performance gains and what stimuli can hurt them, like the accumulated fatigue over the course of a 162-game season.
Going forward, as we collect more and more biomechanics captures and are able to cross-reference data with training info, we can continue to improve our understanding of what markers contribute to success, and which are associated with backslides in performance.
We are only at the beginning of tapping into the ability of the biomechanics lab.

What is the Value of a Prospect? An Updated Methodology - Driveline Baseball,2019-03-01T02:21:13+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/02/prospect-valuation-much-top-prospects-worth-professional-baseball-teams/,"This off-season and spring training have seen a major upheaval in the number and type of coach that is being hired into the professional ranks, while the use of technology throughout all levels of professional baseball has increased drastically.
This new level of investment demonstrates clearly that teams are valuing player development more highly than in the past. But, even with millions of dollars pouring into new technology, personnel and methods, a question remains:
Are teams investing enough?
Over the next few months, we’re sharing several articles that look at Major League player development from a different perspective relative to what you typically see on this blog.  We are going to look at the business case of developing baseball players to try and determine an appropriate level of investment by a team.
Our goal is to understand if organizations fall short in leveraging their resources to optimize a player’s career trajectory. Ultimately, we’ll attempt to evaluate how much suboptimal habits cost organizations in the long run.
Before we can accomplish that, we need to address how much a given prospect is worth to an MLB team. By performing an analysis to generate our own valuations, we can quantify the net value of any persistent inefficiencies that may exist within player development today.
Our series on The Business Case for Development begins with this feature and will have several parts:
Valuing prospects on a per-dollar basis is not a new concept. Creagh & DiMiceli, Zimmerman, and Edwards have previously laid out extensive blueprints on how to derive prospect valuations. However, since there is no so-called right way to calculate these figures, each piece has relied on its own set of assumptions, which have created discrepancies in the respective values reported.
Some arbitrary choices, such as choosing an appropriate estimate of $/WAR and a discount rate, are simply unavoidable given the nature of task. However, other assumptions are shortcuts of more granular analysis, because going through historical WAR and salary values on a yearly basis is tedious and potentially unreliable if not done carefully.
We have never shied away from the tedious.
Our prospect-valuation model minimizes these shortcuts to improve confidence that our results accurately depict how much a prospect is truly worth.
As an aside, the “true worth” of a prospect is best described in layman’s terms as what a team should pay to acquire that player given the price of acquiring production in the open market.
The first step in this process is to calculate a $/WAR figure that best represents the current standing of the market. Any aggressive or conservative estimate of $/WAR can skew prospect valuations by a relatively large margin, so it’s important to get this right.
Fortunately, Matt Swartz has provided a sound method on how to derive a reasonable proxy of $/WAR within a given season. We replicated his work and gathered the names and salaries of every player with at least six years of service time in a given season since 2010. We then paired these player seasons together with each player’s respective Fangraphs WAR (fWAR) output and summed both veteran production and salaries on a per-year basis. To account for situations in which a veteran cost a team a draft pick, we added the NPV (Net Present Value) of the attached pick to said player’s first-year salary on his new contract, because this is when teams forfeiting the pick incur that cost.
By dividing the sum of veteran salaries by the sum of veteran fWAR, we obtain relatively conservative market estimates of how much teams spent to acquire a win in the open market in a given season (with the caveat that players who signed extensions were included in our sample). We’ve compared our estimates (DL $/WAR) to Swartz’s (Swartz $/WAR) from years 2010 to 2016 to validate our 2017 and 2018 figures, shown in the table below.
While reassuring that our figures are consistent with ones published by Swartz, the uncertainty that surrounds the influence of the newest CBA on teams’ spending habits makes it difficult to use these historical estimates to forecast an accurate $/WAR figure for 2019. As shown above, since MLB instituted stricter spending limits and penalties on payroll expenditure in the 2017-18 offseason, the market has been in a deflationary period.
To workaround these limitations, we turned to the Steamer Projection System and gathered projected WAR and salary estimates for all veterans during the 2019 season. Given that prior research has found projection systems are overly optimistic in their forecasts of veteran production by roughly 15% and that aging curve peaks have been trending younger, we also performed this analysis on 2018 data to get a sense of how biased these figures are in the present day.
In first looking at 2018 projected $/WAR, we found that our new estimate came in at ~71% of its actual value, falling from $10.64M to $7.6M. For 2019, projected $/WAR came in a hair under $8M, which we now know is only ~70-85% of what the actual figure will be for the season. To correct for this, we multiplied $8M by 30% to obtain a $/WAR estimate of $10.4M for the upcoming 2019 season.
This $/WAR estimate ends up being significantly higher than the $8.5M and $9M suggested by  Creagh & DiMiceli and Edwards to calculate their respective prospect valuation figures. However, our $/WAR estimate is derived from actual market data rather than intuition. To justify player valuations in the $8-9M range, $/WAR would have to drop by over 21% in just a two-year period. That seems unlikely.
Furthermore, even if $/WAR on the open market hypothetically fell to levels below $10M, we believe that there are two reasons why a simple estimate of $/WAR would actually undersell the value that homegrown production provides an organization.
First, there is little potential for sunk costs with homegrown players because their salaries are not guaranteed beyond one season at a time.
For example, in acquiring Jonathan Schoop last year at the trade deadline, the Brewers obtained a potential buy-low bounceback performer who could have simply been non-tendered at the end of the season (at no cost to the organization) if an uptick in production did not occur. Hypothetically, had Schoop returned to his 2017 production levels, the Brewers would have likely exercised the right to retain his services for the 2019 season and extracted additional surplus value beyond the 2018 season. Thus, by acquiring Schoop, the Brewers obtained loads of upside at relatively no risk, which surely drove up the price point they had to pay the Orioles in order to receive his services.
Homegrown players also possess minor league options for 3 years, which can be used for developmental purposes (see Alex Gordon’s 2009-2010-2011 seasons) and additional roster flexibility (see the Dodgers and A’s 2018 starting rotation) that provide teams with added value that open market players cannot offer.
As a result, teams should be willing to pay more in terms of $/WAR for these players given that they possess team-friendly volatility that includes hypothetical team options after every season. As a result, their distribution of outcomes generally contain much higher upside than a typical free agent does, and the risk is mitigated by the fact that future salaries are reliant on production itself.
This doesn’t necessarily mean that a two-WAR season from a homegrown player is worth more to a team than a two-WAR season from one acquired through free agency. However, if we hold salaries equal, it does mean that teams are relatively protected over multiple years from a worst-case-scenario outcome in the case of homegrown players. This creates value for teams (either through trade or over multiple years) that should not be ignored.
Second, since payroll expenditure is now a constraint on acquiring wins in the open market for several large-market teams (who are traditionally on the steep slope of the win curve), players who generate surplus production at relatively low cost can also give teams the flexibility to spend elsewhere on their roster—which in itself has value.
For example, a team within $20M of the “cap” (err…tax threshold) would not be able to extract full surplus value if they were offered a trade for a five-WAR player at $25M per year, given the tax and additional penalties they’d be subjected to. However, this same team would be able to extract maximum surplus value from a three-WAR at $5M per year player if offered via a trade and thus would likely be willing to pay more to acquire that asset (despite each player having similar surplus values).
As a result, players who are productive at lower salaries (typically homegrown players) are likely more valuable to a given team than a simple $/WAR estimate gives them credit for. Thus, if we construct an approach to valuing prospects that uses $/WAR and select a figure below market rate, we will likely underestimate our prospect valuations by fairly significant margin.
As described earlier, to calculate prospect valuations we also need to select an appropriate discount rate that reasonably estimates how much a team would trade a win today for a win a number of years in the future. Getting this number to be fairly accurate is critical because prospects can take a while to develop and fulfill their six years of club control. Any mis-estimation of the market’s discount rate can compound on itself and skew our results by millions of dollars. (See Bonilla, Bobby.)
To pinpoint a discount rate, we again turn to the work of Matt Swartz, who has previously used the difference in $/WAR spent by teams on free agents with and without draft-pick compensation attached to them in order to find a discount rate that causes both FA groups to have equal expenditure. (For more info on his methods and why the rate is estimated to be relatively high, click here.) Historically, Swartz has found that the discount rate fluctuates at around 10%, but that the value is subject to a large amount of variance on a yearly basis for a variety of reasons.
Given the variability and limitations associated with estimating a discount rate, we decided to select the 9.3% figure provided in Swartz’s initial work on discounting future values in baseball. In using 9.3% instead of 10%, we select a figure that is more closely aligned with the discount rates chosen in prior prospect-valuation research. Furthermore, this figure was calculated when draft-pick compensation was easier to tease out and when $/WAR estimates were more likely to still be linear. (In a case where $/WAR was no longer linear, Swartz’s analysis would no longer be feasible given that only a specific subset of free agents are offered QO’s.)
With a framework for deriving $/WAR and discount rate established, we can calculate prospect values.
To do this, we use Baseball America’s historical top 100 list, as they’re the most easily accessible resource of historical prospect rankings to build out our database.
We collected BA’s rankings from 1995 to 2009 and assigned each player with a coinciding WAR value (from Fangraphs), playing-time figure (from Fangraphs), and salary (from USA Today and Fangraphs) for each season that followed a year’s respective ranking.
Building this database answers questions like, “How much WAR did Alex Rodriguez produce in 1998 at his salary just three years after ranking atop Baseball America’s Top 100 in 1995.”
This structure allows us to work with more precise measures of analysis relative to previous work on prospect valuations, which finds a prospect’s total WAR accumulated over the first X number of years of his career and then relies on several assumptions to estimate how much money that prospect will earn through arbitration and how his value will be distributed over the first several years of his career.
The alternative methodology used by previous analysts is understandable since it avoids having to use historical estimates for $/WAR. However, there is always the risk that the assumptions used end up being misguided in practice.
The most glaring mistake we note is how previous estimates have tended to distribute the WAR and salaries earned by players over the first seven to nine years of their careers equally, regardless of whether they are the first or hundredth best prospect. Since top prospects are typically closer to the big leagues than those at the bottom of the list, any one-size-fits-all distribution assumption will inherently overvalue one tier of prospects at the expense of another when redistributing and then discounting WAR. Unless separate tiers of prospects are treated differently in terms of how surplus WAR is redistributed, you are giving a relative advantage to one group over the other.
For example, in Edwards’s most recent valuation work, the production within the first nine seasons of a player’s career WAR was gathered and redistributed two years into the future. By using nine years instead of seven, Edwards likely inflates the value of top prospects, who are more likely to produce larger amounts of cumulative WAR over longer periods of time and are closer to the big leagues. To counteract that, Edwards then pushes these inflated WAR values two years into the future, which deflates the relative value of top prospects given that they are more likely to have an ETA sooner than two years.
These issues compounds when you “smooth” prospect values by rank, as the “slope” of your line will either be too sensitive or not sensitive enough, helping or hurting top-tier prospects relative to the rest of their peers.
(This compares the production of Top 10 prospects vs. Bottom 10 prospects by WAR within 2 years after being ranked)
To avoid this pitfall, it’s better to rely on more precise measures of surplus WAR that use only actual production/wages and historical $/WAR to bring surplus wins back into present day context. (Historical estimates of $/WAR pre-2006 are simply calculated from how much WAR free agents usually produce in a given season [~30%] and how big their share is in terms of the overall salary of the league [~75%.])
Once we calculate the yearly surplus value of a top 100 player before he reaches six years service time, we discount those values by 9.3% raised to each year after the coinciding rankings come out. We then translate those values into present-day dollars and sum the yearly totals by player in order to find the total discounted surplus value per player during his years of club control.
Equipped with these newly calculated NPV metrics by prospect ranking, we next turned to Fangraphs scouting board to convert the rankings of each individual player listed on BA’s Top 100 into prospect grades. This will allow us to compare prospects based on their actual projected value, rather than a ranking system that treats the 99th and 100th best prospects differently despite both of them having the same future value.
On Fangraphs “The Board,” three different sets of prospect lists sorted by both grade and ranking are available to run a simple regression to obtain predicted prospect grades based on prospect rank. With over 2,000 players graded and ranked within that time period, we generated an estimated prospect grade ranging from 35 to 70 for players ranking 900th or higher on a prospect leaderboard. The grade-to-ranking results are in line with what Edwards recently reported within his analysis and are provided below.
**Strikingly, if ~900 prospects across all 30 teams are graded 35 or higher, that means >75% of minor league baseball players have no expected production in the big leagues. Thus, being able to develop organizational depth into substantive value could help teams to realize large returns, something we will address in future blog posts.**
Now that we have surplus values and estimated prospect grades for each prospect listed in BA’s Top 100 from 1995 to 2009, we ran a model to smooth out our surplus values by prospect grade. Once we fit these results onto a year’s worth of prospects graded above a 35, we then binned the values by prospect grade and received the values below. For comparison purposes, we added Edwards’s estimates both at $9M/WAR (what is published on Fangraphs) and at $10.4M/WAR.
In comparing the numbers a bit more closely, we observe that figures from both models are fairly similar at the top half of the table and then diverge significantly for 45 grade prospects and below. Finding similar results between models for prospects graded 50 and above is validating and a testament to Edwards’s intuition and strong assumptions.
However, in most financial models of farm systems, the returns come from having a high hit rate among top prospects and getting value from players outside the top rankings, those ranked 45 and below. Having an accurate model for the top-end of the prospect world is good, but we need to ensure an accurate evaluation of non-elite prospects as well.
To test our model’s results for sub-45 prospects, we evaluated MLB trades to see if teams were exchanging wins for prospects at prices we would expect given our model’s valuations.
To avoid skewing our results by including shaky forecasts of players with more than two years of service time and more than two years on their current contract, we first looked at a handful of simple trades that occurred during this off-season. In the left-hand column you see our estimated value of NPV for the big leaguer acquired (based on a $10.4M/WAR estimate and Steamer predictions) alongside our estimates for value of prospects exchanged in the deal (Sum of DL NPV) and Edwards’s estimates for the value of prospects exchanged in the deal (bumped up to a $10.4M/WAR estimate).
**Note that Alfaro had five years of club control remaining and was most recently graded a 45. We simply multiplied his respective 45-grade value by .8 to obtain to obtain his NPV. Also, Realmuto’s Steamer projections do not include framing, which means his NPV is likely underestimated in the chart above.**
Given the small sample size and the relative noise surrounding how the market dictates player values, it’s tough to take much away from the table. Initially, it looks like our estimates might come in a little bit high on players such as Alonso and Roark while Edwards’s values seem to come in too low on Martin and Roark.
In general, these initial findings make sense, as the appropriate values for prospects ranked 45 and below seem to drop off precipitously and our model lacks prior information on the actual success of these said players to adjust for this. (The 100th ranked prospect is typically a 50.) It is therefore reasonable to believe that our model is just overly optimistic for 45-grade prospects.
On the flipside, Edwards uses some clever methods to project surplus value in prospects outside BA’s Top 100, but these methods fail to account for players who drop out of BA’s Top 100, still make the big leagues, and end up being productive. Thus, his numbers might slightly deflate the proportion of WAR that 45-grade prospects and lower might actually deserve.
Regardless, to confirm this hypothesis we need more trades. So, we pulled the major transactions at the last trade deadline and performed a similar analysis to what was provided above. Rather than attempt to pinpoint a specific NPV value that a team acquired through MLB talent (likely impossible given the hyper-specific context in which each player was acquired), we instead decide to highlight the more interesting trades.
Initially, a $275M discrepancy may not look promising, but our models are diverging as expected. For example, our numbers seem to overshoot the players traded for Schoop, Happ, and Britton, whereas Edwards’s numbers seem to undershoot the likes of Machado, Pham, and the majority of relievers who had bundles of 40s and 35s packaged for them.
Two other trades worth mentioning are the Chris Archer deal, which Edwards highlighted within his main article as a validation of his figures, and the Oscar Mercado deal, which is a bit peculiar but provides unique insight into how teams value prospects themselves.
In the case of the Archer deal, both models provided almost identical values once we accounted for the necessary boost in $/WAR for Edwards’s figures. This gives us strong confidence that our higher-profile prospect valuations are both fairly accurate and consistent.
The Mercado deal is perhaps both models’ most telling test because we’re dealing with a rare prospect-for-prospect trade in extenuating circumstances.
It was seen as puzzling when announced, but with Mercado being Rule 5 eligible and already on the Cardinals 40-man when 40-man spots for outfielders in St. Louis were virtually all accounted for, it was likely that the Cardinals were forced to move Mercado in order to salvage any value out of the situation.
Given this context, we’d imagine that no team would be willing to pay full price for Mercado knowing very well that St. Louis has no leverage—they’re going to lose Mercado to the waiver wire regardless. However, we also know that almost every team who projects to have an opening on their 40-man in December should be interested in acquiring Mercado given the low price point. As a result, we’d expect interested teams to drive up the price so that STL would receive and accept an offer that comes in just below Mercado’s estimated surplus value.
To test this assumption using our model, we compare the net value of a 45-grade prospect at ~$14M in exchange for two 40-grade prospects valued at ~$6.4M each. In doing so, we find that the prospect package St. Louis received from Cleveland comes in about $1.35M below Mercado’s estimated surplus value, which is about what we’d expect given the context above.
Using Edwards’s model, we estimate that a 45+ position player prospect is worth about $9.2M and that a 40-grade position player is worth about $2.3M. When you do the math, Edwards’s model favors Cleveland’s side of the deal by ~$4.6M, likely too large of a discrepancy to accurately depict how both teams valued the players exchanged.
Given what the trade tables tell us, the best way to model how teams actually value prospects their lower-tier prospects is to hedge in between both models for prospects graded 45 and lower. By averaging our respective 40- and 45-grade values, we hopefully clean up our overly aggressive rankings on 45-grade prospects and boost Edwards’s underreporting of 40-grade prospects and lower.
In looking at the newly added column, which incorporates our combined prospect values, we see more palatable numbers across the board, with maybe one or two exceptions sprinkled in. In revisiting the Mercado trade with our new numbers, we end up ~$1.25M off the mark this time, which is reasonable and well within an estimated margin for error given the limitations of the data that we are working with.
With added confidence in these new figures, we present the newly adjusted prospect valuation numbers below.
Looking ahead, these new prospect valuations will be the foundation for many of the articles we intend to write on player development.
With a better understanding of the value realized by organizations when prospects improve their status from one grade to the next, we gain insight into how much is at stake when a player’s career trajectory can rise or fall based on the environment and programming he is subjected to.
We’ll take this information to evaluate player development departments, analyze appropriate programming risk, and address suboptimal behavior exhibited by professional organizations as they look to gain the most value by enhancing player development. In the long run, we feel that this analysis will provide coaches, players, and fans with better insight into how much value teams are leaving on the table.

How do Batters See the Ball? A Review of Gaze Research in Batting - Driveline Baseball,2019-02-26T04:41:17+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/02/batters-see-ball-review-gaze-research-batting/,"As access to ball-flight data becomes more readily available and intricate theories of pitch/swing design continue to increase in popularity within the player-development community, we can easily overlook one of the most arguably fundamental concepts of the game: how batters see the ball as it heads towards home plate.
While much has been written within the sabermetric community about tunneling, game theory, vision training, etc., few researchers have thoroughly reviewed what information sources hitters are attuned to and how these sources influence perception. Let’s take a deep dive into what we now know about gaze behavior and how that might affect our respective in-game approach.
Note: When we talk about gaze tracking, or gaze behavior, we’re talking about where a player is looking; that is, the movement of the hitter’s eyes and head as he tracks an incoming pitch.
This review is detailed and comprehensive, so if you only want a summation of the discussion, we recommend scrolling to the key takeaways at the end. For those who want all the gory details of gaze behavior in batting, let’s begin.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
Research on batter gaze behavior started with the work of Hubbard and Seng in 1954, who used both qualitative observation (in-game) and cinematography (during BP) to analyze the head and eye movements of MLB and NCAA batters. Using relatively crude methods by today’s standards, the research concluded that batters tend to keep their head relatively fixated while tracking a pitch they intend to swing at (likely where the axiom “keep your head still” is derived from) and, more importantly, that eye movements of expert batters cannot track a pitch all the way to home plate.
Given the technological limitations at the time, it took until 1984 for anyone to publish a worthwhile attempt to replicate these findings and build on Hubbard and Seng’s paper. Researchers Bahill and LaRitz analyzed several college players and one MLB subject (Brian Harper) in their ability to track a wiffle ball attached to a fishing line propelled by a motor at greater than 60 mph (as you can imagine, batters were not permitted to swing).
Bahill and LaRitz’s main findings partially confirmed the work of Hubbard and Seng: batters were generally unable to follow a pitch in their central vision as it crossed home plate, despite the relatively low velocity of the incoming pitch and the batter’s inability to swing during the experiment. As noted in the paper, the average amateur player’s gaze falls behind the ball at roughly nine feet in front of home plate, whereas MLB participant Brian Harper was able to track the pitch until roughly five and a half feet in front of home plate.

Conceptually, this makes sense based on what we now know about smooth-pursuit eye movement and angular velocities of a baseball as it travels towards home plate. Although baseball players have a superior ability to track fast moving objects compared to the general population (Uchida et al., 2013), there are a couple of things working against them that make it extremely difficult to obtain useful information from the latter part of ball flight. First, the angular velocity of an incoming pitch can reportedly reach up to 750 deg/sec as it crosses home plate (Higuchi et al., 2018), which is well above the highest reported values of smooth-pursuit eye movements in humans of 120 deg/sec (Bahill & LaRitz, 1984). Second, batters are also constrained by visuo-motor delay, or the time it takes to react to an object’s change in trajectory. For example, it takes roughly 200-250 milliseconds for us to react to an unexpected ball and check our swing (Gray, 2009) or to react to an instant change in target trajectory in a finger-tracking task (Engel & Soechting, 2000).
As a result, when batters are occluded from seeing the last 150 milliseconds of ball flight, there are no significant differences in performance than if they were able to see the entire trajectory of an incoming pitch (Higuchi et al., 2016). With these results in mind, the concept of tunneling was born to take advantage of these limitations in batter perception.
However, like most complex topics related to human behavior, there are certainly more layers to batter gaze behavior to consider.
As mentioned above, the MLB participant in Bahill and LaRitz’s research (Brian Harper) was able to see a pitch deeper in its trajectory relative to the lesser skilled participants. In doing so, Harper demonstrated an ability to produce faster smooth-pursuit eye movements and to couple both head and eye movement together, which dismisses the head-movement axiom promoted by Hubbard and Seng. This ability stands in opposition to the collegiate batters, who were only able to use either head or eye movement when tracking a pitch, but not both.
To add an additional caveat to the findings, one amateur batter in the Bahill and LaRitz study was able to use an anticipatory saccade during ball flight, which allowed him to align his gaze with the ball as it crossed home plate. Bahill and LaRitz noted that this batter was perhaps motivated to do this in order gain additional visual feedback on where the ball would have made contact with the bat, a form of feedback that we now know is important in batting (Gray, 2009). They coined this gaze strategy as the “optimal learning strategy,” in which batters sacrifice the ability to adjust their swings during the middle portion of ball flight in order to “park their gaze” at contact.
As a result, these findings provide a much more complex picture of how batters track the ball, as multiple strategies can seemingly be used by different batters of varying skill.
To explore this further, albeit in cricket, Land and McLeod (2000) sought to breakdown the differences in gaze behavior of three batters of varying skill levels using a pitching machine. In their experiment, they found all three batters used an anticipatory saccade at ball bounce and, more interestingly, that higher skilled batters initiated their saccades sooner.
Combing these results with those of Bahill and LaRitz, a straightforward takeaway might be that expert performers are simply better able to align their gaze ahead of the ball for the majority of ball flight, and that they employ a variety of unique skills to do this. However, we can only take away so much from these studies because they had serious design flaws.
Each participant faced some combination of below-average velocity, a pitching machine, or an inability to swing, which we know can drastically influence results between expert and novice performers (Mann, Abernethy, & Farrow, 2010). Furthermore, none of the recent studies mentioned above included truly elite participants.
To overcome these shortcomings, a 2013 cricket batting study was published by Mann, Spratford, and Abernethy, which included two elite professional cricket batters and two club-level cricket batters facing game-like velocities against a screen-based pitching simulator.
Supporting the findings of Land and McLeod as well as Bahill and LaRitz, the researchers found that expert batters initiated earlier saccades at ball-bounce and coupled both head and eye movements with greater efficiency. Expert batters were able to follow the ball with their heads egocentrically, meaning that they don’t need to move their eyes to keep the ball within their central vision.
However, instead of just simply relying on precise head movement, expert batters shifted their gaze to be farther ahead of the ball throughout the trajectory, even initiating a second anticipatory saccade just before bat-ball contact (like what Bahill and LaRitz found) so that their gaze was “parked” at contact point for the majority of trials.
On the other hand, club-level batters were much more likely to have their gaze trail behind the ball during its trajectory and were also less likely to initiate a second saccade. As a result, on good-length and short-length trials, expert batters aligned their gaze with the ball at contact on 100% and 90% of their respective trials, whereas club batters only aligned their gaze with the ball at contact on 13% and 70% of their respective trials.
Club batters also performed significantly worse by measures of contact scores, naturally providing more concrete evidence that predictive-gaze behavior and earlier/more frequent saccades is a hallmark of better batting performance and skill.
Despite the solid experimental design, the 2013 study by Mann et al. also had its limitations. First, only four athletes participated in the study, so it’s difficult to say whether the gaze behavior of two elite and two club batters truly represented the general population. Second, although bounce length was varied, no curve was incorporated into the pitches that batters were told to swing at. Last, age was not controlled for, so we’re left unsure of whether this so-called expert gaze behavior is something that develops in early adolescence or later in a professional career.
To control for these issues, Sarpeshkar, Mann, and Abernethy (2017) published an excellent follow-up study with the hopes of replicating earlier findings related to gaze behavior in cricket batting. A total of 43 cricket batters were split up into four groups by skill (elite vs. club) and age (adult vs. college-aged batters). The batters faced two blocks of game-like pitches so that one block consisted of straight pitches only, whereas the other had a combination of curved and straight pitches to isolate for the effect of curved trajectories on gaze.
In looking at straight-blocked pitches only, the researchers had mixed results. They were unable to replicate the results found in Mann et al. (2013) that elite batters egocentrically tracked each pitch with their heads, because mean head angle for elite batters were relatively similar to that of club batters (3.1 deg vs. 3.7 deg). Furthermore, the researchers did not find any evidence that elite hitters initiated anticipatory saccades significantly earlier than club batters did.
However, it was shown that, on average, elite batters directed their gaze farther ahead of the ball compared to club batters (-.6 deg v. .4 deg), maintained more consistent gaze-head angle across different trials, were more likely to initiate a second saccade towards bat-ball contact, directed their gaze more towards the ball at bat-ball contact (46.1% vs. 26.1%), and had better performance at the plate. These findings held true regardless of whether an expert batter was an adult or “youth,” leading the researchers to conclude that elite gaze behavior develops during early adolescence.
But, when introducing just the possibility of curved trials into the experiment, the expert “advantage” all but disappeared to the extent that the performance of expert vs. club batters was indistinguishable. Gaze fell farther behind the ball in these trials, saccades were less frequent and delayed, and the probability of locating gaze at bat-ball contact decreased from 28.2% to 16.6%.
When actually adding curved pitches into the analysis, expert vs. club batting outcomes continued to decline and expert vs. club batting performance remained indistinguishable. However, there was evidence that expert batters were better able to functionally adapt their gaze to accommodate curving trajectories when compared to club batters. For example, elite batters directed their gaze towards “swinging” pitches more accurately than club batters on curving trajectories, and they used a higher proportion of oblique saccades than club batters did.
So, despite years of research highlighting the correlations between better performance and hallmarks of expert gaze behavior, that relationship almost all but disappears when even the possibility of a curving pitch is introduced.
The researchers state that these results emphasize the importance of top-down influences of expectations in visual-motor behavior. For example, expert batters are better able to account for relevant context to aid in their performance (Gray, 2002) and all batters perform better with advanced information on pitch probabilities prior to a given plate appearance (Gray, 2015). Perhaps in a more realistic setting, where pitch types aren’t varied at random, expert batters are better able to use context to maximize their advanced abilities to track the baseball with or without curve.
If this is true, this has significant implications related to sequencing, because a pitcher will have to weigh randomizing pitch types in conjunction with other concepts, such as tunneling or “waste pitches,” that are also hypothesized to negatively influence a batter’s perceptual capabilities.
For batters looking to improve their ability to track a baseball, perhaps learning the pitch-type tendencies of pitchers in different situations is a worthwhile endeavor compared to other visual-training modalities. If anything, the Sarpeshkar, Mann, and Abernethy paper indicates that even if a batter has elite gaze behavior, he’ll be unlikely to take advantage of this skill if he does not have an accurate idea of what pitch might be coming.
Since we’ve spent the past three studies talking about cricket, it’s time to transition back to baseball.
After a thirty-year freeze in the research, Fogt and Zimmerman (2014) and Fogt and Persson (2017) completed two pilot studies using collegiate batters in a controlled lab environment where tennis balls were shot from a pitching machine at roughly 76 mph.
In conditions where batters were instructed not to swing, pitches were predominantly followed through head movement initially and batters incorporated eye movement later on during ball flight when the projectiles were travelling at a faster angular velocity. Within the 2017 paper, it was found that participants used an anticipatory saccade (as shown in Bahill & LaRitz, 1984) to follow the pitch as it crossed the plate, likely to generate a comparison relating early ball flight to final pitch location.
In the swinging condition, batters again relied on mostly head movement to track pitches during ball flight and were able to align their gaze with the ball until roughly five and a half feet to home plate. The key finding here was that despite allowing their participants to swing, the collegiate batters were still able to align gaze for just as long as Brian Harper was able to in the Bahill and LaRitz study.
The researchers speculate that despite not being able to use late ball-flight information to aid in performance (as reported by Higuchi et al., 2016) it may serve batters well in future ABs to continually track pitches for as long they can.
More recently, a paper by Higuchi et al. (2018) looked at the gaze behavior of six collegiate batters when facing a pitching machine set to fast and slow speed settings (90.15 mph / 71.4 mph). The researchers broke up ball flight into 4 1/5th intervals starting at 20% to see if the magnitude of head or eye movement significantly differed throughout ball flight. In both the fast and slow speed settings, head movement significantly increased later in ball flight, whereas eye movement was relatively minimized throughout.
They also found that within their group of six participants, three stopped moving their heads once their swings were initiated, while the other three continued to follow the ball with head movement for as long as possible. In particular, one subject demonstrated the ability to align his gaze with the ball at the moment of bat-ball contact, but the other five could not. However, unlike in the blocked-straight trials of the aforementioned cricket studies, the researchers found no correlation with the alignment of gaze at bat-ball contact and batting performance.
Therefore, in considering these results in conjunction with the two papers by Fogt and Zimmerman and Fogt and Persson, it is reasonable to conclude that head movement is the predominate driver of how a batter tracks a baseball pitch. This makes sense intuitively, given what we already know about the limitations of smooth-pursuit eye movements and the speed of incoming pitches.
In fact, Higuchi et al. go one step further and suggest that rapid-eye movement during ball flight might actually be detrimental to performance in baseball batting, given that excessive changes in eye position may require too much processing time for the body to re-adjust its spatial relationship to the ball and the bat. While interesting, the Sarpeshkar, Mann, and Abernethy study indicates that we probably need a more thorough baseball-batting study that includes both expert and novice batters hitting against straight and curved trajectories at game-like velocities before we can derive a more specific conclusion such as that.
Recapping over sixty years of gaze behavior research certainly leaves us with more questions than answers, but here’s what we know at this point in time.
How Do Batters Track the Ball?
More recent research has indicated that head movement plays a vital part in tracking a given pitch and that eye movement plays a minimal role at best. However, there has yet to be a published gaze-tracking study in baseball that has been able to attribute these behaviors to an increase or decrease in batting performance or against both straight and curved pitches.
How Long Do Batters Track the Ball?
There is strong evidence that the first 150ms of ball flight are vital to batting performance and that the last 150ms are irrelevant. However, we have yet to see that result replicated in an in situ environment that incorporates curved pitches and relevant game context.
This is problematic because we know in situ environments are critical to differentiating expert vs. novice performance, and we also know that some batters are able to align their gaze with the ball at contact. Furthermore, in a recent abstract published in the Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology where two professional batters faced fifteen fastballs, fifteen curveballs, and fifteen changeups randomly ordered by type and location in a virtual environment, it was found that the temporal error at bat-ball contact could be predicted simply by the deviation of the batter’s gaze from the ball. It was also reported that temporal error was minimized when the head and ball were aligned at contact (Nakamoto, Fukuhara, & Mann, 2018).
Of course, we need these results to be published elsewhere to draw multiple conclusions from them, but this indicates that we have a lot more work to do before we can definitively say whether professional baseball batters are unequipped to track the ball over the last 150ms of ball flight and whether that information is irrelevant in hitting a baseball successfully.
Do Experts Track the Ball Differently Than Novices?
We do not exactly know how expert batters track a baseball compared to novices, because this question has not been investigated in over thirty years. In turning to cricket batting, expert batters have been found to align their gaze farther ahead of the incoming pitch, couple their gaze more closely with a pitch at bat-ball contact, and better accommodate their gaze strategies to follow curved pitches. That said, it is unclear whether any of this information translates to baseball batting.
If there is anything to take away between the differences in the gaze of expert and novice performers, it is that skilled batters may be better able to account for uncertainties in ball flight through advanced cues (Kato & Fakuda, 2002) and top-down cognitive influences (Gray, 2002). As a result, whatever advantage experts have as it relates to gaze may be leveraged during game-like context rather than a typical lab setting.
What Is Next?
In an attempt to fill this aforementioned gap in the literature, we’ve begun our own research on batter gaze behavior with the hopes of changing the way we understand how batters see the baseball. A lot of work needs to be done, but given the increasing interest in tackling more in-depth questions related to practice design and pitch sequencing, we believe that this will be a significant contribution to the baseball community when all is said and done.

Biomechanics Rewind: A Look at the Numbers from the Last Six Months - Driveline Baseball,2019-02-15T05:13:40+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/02/biomechanics-rewind-look-numbers-last-six-months/,"This past summer at Driveline, we had more than 200 athletes pass through our gym, and each of them went through a full biomechanics assessment. That’s a lot of data, a lot of arm paths, a lot of lower-half mechanics, a lot of kinematic sequences, and a lot of arm stress.
From the information gathered, we’ve been able not only to figure out averages and baselines but also a better idea for target metrics that we have identified as meaningful or actionable. Knowing what averages to look for when correcting an athlete’s arm action, or what a good lead leg block looks like, is essential to correcting mechanical flaws.
We won’t go too much into how we interpret biomechanics reports for athletes, but we’ll share some observations and provide a big picture look at the data.
We had more than 200 athletes and more than 300 captures, but we had to do a bit of data cleaning. Markers falling off during captures and inconsistent mechanics can lead to high standard deviations in the signals we look at. To limit variance, we removed data with more than 5% variance in torque values.
We were left with 182 captures, an average height of 6’1”, an average weight of 195 lb., and an average fastball velocity of 81.3 mph. The table below details all of the metrics that we looked at:
That’s a lot of data.
We had an average pitch velocity over 81 mph in a motion capture lab. In the past, ASMI has classified 78 mph as “elite,” so by this definition the average athlete coming through our gym is elite. That’s something to be proud of.
On the mechanics side, we now know that the average thrower at Driveline releases the ball at about 90 degrees of shoulder abduction and about 0 degrees of shoulder horizontal abduction. This means that the throwing arm is raised neutrally out to the side, similar to a t-pose.
T-pose: arms in line with the shoulders—0 degrees of horizontal abduction—and raised to 90 degrees of abduction
So, if the throwing arm is mostly neutral and in-line with the torso, what’s extension?
Extension doesn’t come from extending your arm out in front. It is actually a result of forward trunk tilt (leaning forward), lateral trunk tilt (leaning to the side), and forward shoulder rotation. While arm drag can detract from this, making adjustments with your arm is only a small piece to the puzzle.
We also know that the average thrower at Driveline keeps his trunk closed by 10 degrees at foot contact and extends his knee by 3 degrees from foot contact to ball release. But what does that really tell us?
Not much.
The averages are just that. They set the baselines that we use in our biomechanics assessment, but we can’t draw many meaningful conclusions from seeing the averages of everything.
There are some valuable things though. Remember this video?
Basically, all that stuff remains true. We saw an average varus torque of 101 Nm, which is in-line with previous research. Assuming you have an average length forearm, that’s like wrenching yourself into external rotation with a 45 lb. plate.
Here’s one more fun tidbit: The average shoulder compression force, the force pushing your shoulder into its socket, was upwards of 1000 N of force. That’s nearly 225 lbs.!
So, what actually correlates to velo?
The strongest correlations (r^2 > 0.2) are between kinematic velocities and joint kinetics. Simply put: move faster to throw harder.
We also see that throwing harder leads to higher joint kinetics, which actually contradicts past research. Basically, the harder you throw, the more stress you put on your arm.
Now the hard part will be figuring out how we can make an athlete rotate faster, move his arm faster, and extend his knee faster. We can save that for later.
Looking at kinematic positions, we actually see that no positional metrics were really correlated with velocity. Forward trunk tilt at ball release has the strongest correlation with an r^2 of 0.195. Past studies have linked forward trunk tilt to velocity, so there may be something there.
Studies have also linked maximum external rotation as well as shoulder horizontal abduction at foot contact to velocity, but we show only weak correlations.
We also see no correlation between torso angle at foot contact (meaning keeping the trunk closed), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t throw with your shoulders totally open. It just means we need to look at the data a little differently.
Positional metrics are harder to address in their relationship to throwing velocity. For example, someone can hit all the right positions, but just be moving very slow—and thus throw the ball slow. It’s a multivariate problem in this regard.
It could also be that the positional metrics simply don’t linearly scale with velocity. There’s a sort of diminishing returns when making changes to those metrics. For example, if you already have 50 degrees of scap retraction, increasing that even further may not make you throw harder. Or if your trunk is already closed off by -20 degrees at foot contact, chances are that closing yourself off even more won’t help all that much.
While you can hit all the perfect positions during a throw, if you’re not moving fast, you’re not going to throw hard. If you’re not strong, you’re not going to throw hard. There’s a multitude of factors that can contribute to velocity—being in the right positions is just one of them. This is where we start to see the real complexity of pitching mechanics.
It could also be argued that some metrics imply that an athlete is throwing more efficiently—that is, with less stress.
There are definitely sequencing patterns more conducive to long term health and others more conducive to higher velo. Can I concretely say what those patterns look like/who displays them? Nope, but I can say that they exist. I think. Maybe. Who knows.
Taking height and weight out of the equation, let’s look at correlations to normalized torques. I’ve provided the most interesting looking correlations, but for those interested, the full table is available.
To prevent the possibility of a multiple comparisons problem (since we are comparing a large number of variables) we used a Bonferroni correction in order to implement a stricter P-value cutoff.
Significant correlations are noted by the P-values with an asterisk next to them.
A couple of things make sense: There are a few correlations to kinematic velocities. The faster you move, the harder you throw, the more torque is put on your arm.
There’s also some interesting correlations to positional metrics. Lateral trunk tilt at ball release is positively correlated with varus and shoulder internal rotation torques, and shoulder abduction at ball release is negatively correlated to varus, internal rotation, and flexion torque.
Lateral trunk tilt is the amount of side tilt that an athlete has. This largely determines arm slot. Shoulder abduction is the upper arm moving in the frontal plane.
So increased lateral trunk tilt and decreased shoulder abduction at ball release both correlate with increases in varus and internal rotation torque. This is how we define “pulling off the ball”—excessive side tilt and arm dragging below the shoulder line. Here’s what that looks like in Visual3D:
We also have decent evidence that pulling off the ball has negative effects on joint torques, which is exciting.
Maximum elbow flexion has positive correlations with elbow varus and shoulder internal rotation torques. This means that being excessively “inside 90” with the arm action could have negative effects on those torques.
Elbow flexion at max external rotation is negatively correlated with elbow flexion and pronation torques, but positively correlated with shoulder adduction torque. This potentially means that decreased elbow flexion (meaning the arm is more extended) at max external rotation—what we would call forearm flyout—could lead to an increase in both elbow flexion torque and pronation torque, but an increase in adduction torque.
Front knee flexion at ball release saw significant negative correlations to varus, shoulder internal rotation, adduction, and horizontal adduction torques. This means that having a more extended knee at ball release—something that potentially indicates a strong lead leg block—is correlated to those increased torques.
This only looks at a couple of metrics available, but it provides insight defining good and bad mechanics. If we can quantify what positions actually lead to a reduction in joint kinetics, that’s immensely valuable.
Let’s look at some comparisons. First: what’s the difference between people who throw slow and people who throw hard?
We binned athletes into five groups: >87 mph, 84-87 mph, 81-84 mph, 75-78 mph, and 75- mph. Our lowest velocity recorded was 69 mph. These were all judged under a similarly-corrected alpha level using a Bonferroni correction.
Kinematic velocities are where we see some obvious differences. From the slowest group to the fastest, trunk angular velocity, elbow extension angular velocity, and lead knee-extension velocity all saw significant increases.
Simply put: rotate faster and make your lead leg block better.
Looking at the kinetics of those who threw slow and those who threw hard, we see confirmation that throwing harder results in more stress on the arm. Even normalizing for height and weight, we see significant increases in all torques except for elbow flexion torque.
Again—throwing harder is significantly correlated with increased torques on the arm.
What if we normalize for velocity to create a velocity-to-stress efficiency metric? A higher number would mean that you are more efficient—that is you generate more velocity per unit of stress. A lower number means you are getting less velocity per unit of stress.
Here we see that all efficiencies go down in the group that threw harder. The harder you throw, the less efficient your mechanics become. Although the changes were not significant (possibly due to the smaller sample size of the two groups), the results are still interesting.
What could that mean? It’s difficult to say, but perhaps as you throw harder, mechanics become less efficient mechanics. Intra-athlete testing of throwing at 50% intent all the way up to 100% intent could provide additional insight to this. This is something we’ll continue to look at as we have more high-level pitchers throw in our lab.
Now, let’s look at lefties versus righties.
Positionally, no differences stand out. From a mechanical standpoint lefties and righties move about the same.
Looking at the kinetics, we see something interesting. When normalizing for height and weight,  varus torque, shoulder internal rotation, and shoulder adduction torque were all significantly lower in lefties.
Interestingly, average velocity by lefties was lower, which could have led to the reduced torques. When factoring in velocity, only varus torque velo efficiency was significantly correlated—which is still impressive. Lefties averaged 16.1 mph per unit of varus stress, whereas righties only got 13.2 mph per unit of varus stress.
What this means is that if you’re a righty and your arm hurts, you should consider throwing with your left arm. Is that how that works?
It’s worth noting that the sample size of lefties was on the lower side (n=25), so a larger sample size could provide us with more insight into these differences.
There’s a lot we can take away from this information. We’ve shown that the faster you move, the more likely you are to throw hard. The harder you throw, the higher the torques on your arm. We’ve quantitatively shown that pulling off the ball can lead to an increase in torques on the arm.
But there are still a lot of unanswered questions.
We weren’t able to correlate any positional metrics with throwing hard. Beyond kinematic velocities, we weren’t able to really see why people throw hard.
There’s also an abundance of other metrics that we haven’t looked at. Timing and sequencing obviously plays a huge role in the delivery, which we didn’t address. We didn’t look at anything in the glove arm—can we quantify positive disconnection? Those are just two ideas to start.
The metrics examined here were generated by an older version of our pipeline. In the newer version, we hope to better answer these questions and look at some other metrics that we think could be interesting.
The pitching motion is incredibly complex system that’s reliant on many factors: strength, speed, timing, flexibility, and many others. Using an ever-expanding list of biomechanical markers and metrics, integrating force plates, and focused research studies, we can continue to enhance our understanding of the pitching motion.
Down the road, initiatives like forward dynamics and more in-depth athlete typing will hopefully provide us with a more complete picture of what makes pitchers throw and what we can do train them. We’re still only at the beginning.

I would assume lead leg block would also be important for the power in a baseball swing.  What are ways to work on Front Lead Leg Block?  especially in Hitters?
“This means that having a more extended knee at ball release—something that potentially indicates a strong lead leg block—is correlated to those increased torques.”
Kendal- Good assumption. You can work on lead leg blocking by adding momentum pre-swing. “Walk-thru’s” are a good example of this. Another way we drill lead led blocking is through med ball work. You can work a shuffle into med ball rotational throws, where you turn linear momentum into an explosive rotational toss.
So that I am understanding the information correctly, when it comes to the lead leg angle and it’s blocking role, for the elite pitchers, once FC happens, the angle of the lead leg changes very little from FC to BR? (39°-38.4°) And in the “lower level” pitchers, their angle in their lead leg changes rather dramatically from FC to BR (36°-43°).
Goody- “…having a more extended knee at ball release—something that potentially indicates a strong lead leg block—is correlated to those increased torques.” The athletes throwing <75 averaged an increase from 36.4 to 43.1 degrees of knee flexion (+6.7 degrees from FC to BR). You can think of this as caving the front knee. The athletes throwing >87 averaged a decrease from 33.9 to 19.7 degrees (-14.2 degrees from FC to BR). Their knee flexion was working back towards 0 degrees or a straight leg. This is more ideal, with the speed at which knee flexion approaches 0 degrees (straightening) also being a key factor.
Here is a link on front leg mechanics that you can also check out –
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/12/efficient-front-leg-mechanics-that-lead-to-high-velocity/
I noticed a very high correlation in max elbow extension angular velocity, I am curious to know what the role of the tricep and pec have in aiding that movement. Or possibly, how a weak tricep/pec may affect that max velocity of elbow extension.
Hey Kalib, you are right about higher velocities and max elbow extensions speeds. Generally, the faster you move, the harder you can throw. Once thing to think about is where this happens in the kinematic sequence, and the speed at which it is happening (ability to replicate in the weight room). There could be more bracing than actual concentric/eccentric movement. However, weakness in those areas, especially the pec, could cause issues in the chain that hurt outcomes or increase risk of injury. As we gather more data, we will start to see what muscle strength or weaknesses can impact sequencing and ultimately velocity.

Pairing Blast and Hittrax Data - Driveline Baseball,2019-02-07T04:13:18+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/02/pairing-blast-hittrax-data/,"While the beginning of the technology revolution in baseball analytics may have started on the pitching side, hitting is catching up fast.
More people and teams than ever have been using objective, precision-measuring technology to evaluate swing outcomes (batted ball technology like Rapsodo Hitting and HitTrax), swing characteristics (BlastMotion), kinematic movements of swings (K-Vest), and a few other categories that we ambiguously refer to here in a blanket cover-all reference.
We use all these tools at Driveline and they generate a ton of instant, usable data. But what is even more trendy than using any one of these tools by themselves?
Using two or more of them at the same time—and time syncing them to inspect on a swing-by-swing basis.
While we’ve been building a growing database of tools stretching across at least three categories, today we discuss timestamping individual HitTrax and Blast swings over the last few months. Below are some general descriptive results and relationships from around 9,000 swings of over 42 individual players.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
First, let’s look at the relationship of the Blast column values to each other. Now there’s not that much literature on what these values should be and how they relate to each other.
Below are some descriptive stats for each of the Blast metrics and the intra-correlations between the metrics:
There are some extremely high correlations here between metrics, with not too much variable of a change in magnitude.
In particular, plane score seems to increase and decrease very closely with on-plane efficiency; the same relationship exists between rotation score and rotational acceleration. A look at the Bland-Altman plots shows an interesting possibility that there may be a constant scalar multiplier turning one metric into another. In other words, only one of each pair of metrics may be especially necessary when evaluating a swing or a set of swings.
Also of interest, and somewhat intuitive for the believers in bat speed, are the very high correlations with bat speed and power, as well as Blast Factor and the peak-hand speed.
There are also healthy, negative (and again intuitive if you can visualize what happens as you cut down on the time it takes to make contact) time-to-contact correlations with the rotation metrics, bat speed, power, and peak-hand speed.
Train at Driveline
Now let’s fold in some HitTrax metrics. To keep it simple, here’s a general view of Blast correlations with some of the main HitTrax metrics.
The magnitude of the correlations may not be visible at first glance (especially not when compared to the daunting Blast intra-correlations), but since we’re looking at a sample size of 9,000 pitches, correlations become statistically significant at a very low level. Some of the ones that are particularly relevant include the following:
We can also bin these metrics by skill level and relevant context to gain preliminary insight into what swing characteristics differentiate pros from amateurs and how these metrics can be impacted by specific pitch tendencies.
In the table above, we see that both exit velocity and bat speed increase at a significant margin as the level of competition rises. Launch angle and attack angle are similar between our college and professional trainees, but each metric is significantly lower in our HS trainees from a relative perspective.
By examining more detailed Blast Metrics by competition level, higher skilled athletes seem to have a lower time to contact, a higher collision efficiency score, and a tendency to let the ball travel deeper when making contact.
By breaking up these metrics by pitch velocity at contact, we see that as a pitch comes in hotter, launch angle increases as attack angle decreases. Of course, if we’re trying to roughly match the plane of a given pitch to maximize outcomes at the plate, and slower pitches descend at a steeper angle (holding location equal), this intuitively makes sense. Interestingly, metrics such as plane efficiency, time to contact, and depth of contact were relatively unaffected by pitch velocity.
When hitting the ball farther out in front of home plate, batters tend to make contact with a higher attack angle, a longer time to contact, a worse plane efficiency score, and a flatter vertical bat angle. You can can also see that EV peaks at somewhere roughly between 22-25 inches out in front of the backend of home plate in our sample, something that has been confirmed by Hit F/X data at the big league level.
Lastly, we can break pitches up by vertical and horizontal location at contact to see how batters adjust their swing to accommodate pitches in different locations in and around the zone.
We see that as location height increases, launch angle and attack angle also increase at the expense of bat speed. Going up the ladder also negatively influences plane efficiency score, increases time to contact, and causes hitters to make contact farther out in front.
While there are less interactions between swing metrics and changes in horizontal pitch location (from a catcher’s perspective), it does look like a batter’s attack angle peaks and pitches travel deeper when a pitch is located down the middle. Connection score and plane efficiency also score better, on average, as pitch location moves farther away from a batter.
In general, this initial breakdown of Blast and HitTrax data shows us how important it is to consider the context of a given pitch and batter skill level when interpreting a player’s given Blast and HitTrax metrics. Before diving into intra-player analysis, exploring ways to control for different variables seems important in objectively assessing an athlete’s swing.
Since the whole sample spanned over 40 athletes, all with their own swings and tendencies, it’s worth looking at the means across the athletes as well—along with an initial exploration of a linear mixed-model analysis with the athlete serving as the random effect—to explore the possibility of the non-independent, repeated measures by the same athlete influencing our quantitative findings.
First, here’s some of the more commonly investigated metrics and their respective descriptive statistics for a list of the anonymized athletes:
From left to right, the metrics are as follows
Here are some regressions ran against these means across a few different combinations, with the respective proportion of variance they cover. While peak and average EV both show high correlations across the metrics we look at here (bat speed, rotational acceleration, power, and peak hand speed), it’s interesting that one’s peak EV seems to correlate higher in all four cases.
We run the risk of correlations being uneven across different subjects and correlation of averages being a potential misrepresentation of the nature of the data. The correlation coefficient is defined as E[(X−μX)(Y−μY)]/σX σY. Even though it makes sense to take averages in this situation, by definition this changes the relationship between the x’s and μX and y’s and μy.
So to kind of loop back and make conclusions on some of these relationships, we also ran a linear mixed-model analysis on the whole dataset of swings, controlling for the pitcher as the random effect and then running a Wald Chi Square Test to determine the significance of the explanatory variable or the fixed effect across all the swings.
Yup, those are all extremely significant at any conceivable alpha level.
Now that we ironed out some long-thought ideas with some concrete numerical findings, we look forward to explaining some more complex ideas and relationships in Part 2 of the Blast-Hittrax data mash-up blog.
Interested in training with us? Both in-gym and remote options are available!
Fantastic analysis! A couple thoughts/questions spring to mind (perhaps some get answered in Part 2)
– will you be making the swing data available to download, like the previous blast tee/front toss/hitting
– Blast defines on plane and rotation score as a 20-80 scaled conversion of the on plane efficiency and rotational acceleration, I believe. The only difference is the scale is based on the level of the player.
– Their Connection score is based on an ideal scenario of 90 degrees at early Connection and 90 degrees at contact. It seems many of your hitters are higher than 90 early on but very close to 90 at contact. I presume a high early connection/90 impact connection also would lead to a lower on plane percentage. It makes me question their ideal (ie early connection is not something a coach should be overly concerned about, as long as they are getting back towards 90 at contact)
– I wonder if you could look at the average metrics controlling for differences in attack angle. For instance, bins by launch angle relative to attack angle. This would be some indication of the contact relative to the barrel. Also I believe Hittrax includes the horizontal angle of the incoming pitch, so perhaps you can factor this is as well.
– I’m wondering if an exit velo/ power ratio would be meaningful/interesting given power seems to be an indication of the potential of a given swing and the ratio would show how often a hitter is able to transfer that power into the ball.
– do you have information on swing and misses as well (plus a lot of fouled back swings were Blast is registering but Hittrax is not)? It would be interesting to know if the average blast swing metrics correlate with contact rates and fouled off/fouled back rates.
The images of the data can be difficult to read even when opened separately and enlarged.
We will work on getting those images enlarged or easier to expand!

A Deeper Dive into Fastball Spin Rate - Driveline Baseball,2019-02-01T04:26:09+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/01/deeper-dive-fastball-spin-rate/,"In a previous article, we discussed the difference between cues and measurements as well as how technology is changing baseball. We now know that instead of simply repeating cues verbatim to players, learning more background knowledge of certain topics is needed. One of those topics is spin rate. As you’ll see today there are lots of layers that go into understanding how a pitch is effective.
We’ve previously covered some basics of fastball spin rate and spin rate of off-speed pitches, but it’s time for another look.
In this article, we first look at high-spin fastballs and ball axis, and then we move deeper into the complex nature of spin, axis, and movement. We also explain some of the nuance with high spin and its relationship to movement. This article intends to show how a concept, like spin rate, can scale from relatively simple to more complex when you really dive into the metrics.
While the available information and what’s relevant to each player scales per level, equipment, and knowledge, today we aim to show what you can learn from even relatively simple explanations, which will open the possibility to learn more down the road.
When a fastball is thrown with backspin, we can explain its vertical movement with Magnus force. The ball spins, pushing the air downward behind it and creating and equal, opposite force upward. So a good part of the movement of a fastball depends on how fast or how slow, called the rate, it is spinning.
This can have effects on hitters, which we’ve observed through research using a pitching machine with different spin rates.
From: The Effect of Fastball Backspin Rate on Baseball Hitting Accuracy: Higuchi, et al., 2013
Picture from: Baseball Spin and Pitchers’ Performance: Kanosue, et al. (Open Access)
Now the fastest spin rate used in the study above is faster than what we’ve seen pitchers throw, but the point still stands: hitters are more likely to swing under a high-spin fastball. We also see that hitters tend to hit more fly balls and have more swings and misses on high-spin fastballs, which is why they’re more likely to hit low-spin fastballs on the ground.
We can also look at the relationship of fastball spin rate (while holding velocity constant) and its relationship to swinging strike percentage and average launch angle.
Now, based on reading the above chart, it would be easy to conclude that high-spin fastballs should be thrown high in the zone and low-spin fastballs should be thrown low in the zone. However, this conclusion isn’t so simple, and we need to look deeper to find better context.
First, you’d need to control for velocity. We’ve seen that spin rate increases with fastball velocity, but it’s also easy to misapply basic lessons—especially if you are comparing pitchers with different velocities. This is largely why we like to use Bauer Units, to better compare fastball spin rates, because you can have pitchers that throw the same spin rates, and whether they are high or low depends on velocity.
Below is a simple example, showing how pitchers with the same spin rate but different velocities have different Bauer Units.
Understanding Bauer Units and how to judge spin with them gives coaches further context of the spin rate of fastballs. But, especially with fastballs, ball axis also needs to be taken into account—and it’s often forgotten.
There is a distinction between a high-spin fastball that has a high degree of vertical movement and one that does not. This is because of the ball’s axis.
So, it’s not just the spin that we want to focus on. We want to focus on the spin, what the axis is, and how that is related to the movement of the pitch. Even more specific, you can have two pitches with the same velocity and spin rate but have different movement profiles based on the axis of the ball.
Below is a pitch with a “1:00” spin axis and a 95% spin efficiency, based on Rapsodo metrics.
Below is a pitch with the same 1:00 axis and a 50% spin efficiency, based on Rapsodo metrics, giving it more cut relative to the pitch with 95% spin efficiency.
Now, video and some published research can tell us that the spin axis of each pitch significantly correlates with the orientation of the hands and fingers just before and at ball release. Which makes having a camera especially important when trying to piece together what ball tracking technology is saying.
When looking closer to see if a pitcher cuts his fastball we need to understand that some pitchers have essentially grown up cutting the ball when they throw a fastball, which is incredibly difficult to change when they’ve thrown thousands if not millions of pitches with that pattern. Other pitchers may have slight fluctuations in their release point, or fingers at release, that can change their spin axis, which can be adjusted given proper video and spin-rate feedback. This is important because one of the differences between amateurs and professional pitchers is the consistency of their spin axis.
The movement of a fastball will also be affected by a pitcher’s arm slot, or release point. As arm slot changes, so does the orientation of the hands and fingers at release, thus affecting the axis of the ball.
Assuming pure transverse spin, a pitcher who throws from “over the top” will have a nearly horizontal spin axis. A high percentage of backspin with a horizontal axis causes most of the spin deflection to be in the positive vertical direction. (That is to say, basically up.) With a more traditional three-fourths slot, we start to see more similar horizontal and vertical break values. This can be attributed to the axis shifting to a more diagonal position—meaning more sidespin. Lastly, a “low slot” or sidearm pitcher, will likely have a fastball spin axis that’s almost purely vertical. As a result, nearly all the movement will be lateral to the arm side.
As you can see, high spin rate by itself does not mean more positive vertical break. In this case, the pitch movement largely depends on the axis which the ball revolves around.
This was examined in 2015 in the Baseball Prospectus annual report. They used Brooks Baseball data along with arm angle measures of 25 pitchers (provided by ASMI). They ended up finding a correlation of .75 between four-seam fastball angle and arm angle and a correlation of .79 between two-seam fastball (sinker) movement and arm angle.
Lastly, how spin axis is measured depends on the technology used to track ball flight.
Both Trackman and Rapsodo measure spin axis but in different ways. Trackman follows the entirety of ball flight and infers spin axis from the trajectory. Rapsodo calculates spin axis directly, but infers trajectory based on the axis itself. Each method has its strengths and shortcomings, for example laminar flow isn’t accurately accounted for, but the main advantage of Rapsodo is that it can accurately measure spin efficiency. This is very helpful for designing pitches.
In short, knowing a pitcher’s spin rate on his fastball is important, but knowing his spin axis is also important because that gives you more context for how the pitch moves and how he can use it, or if it may be beneficial to try and change it.
Beyond the relationships mentioned above, we also know that spin axis influences both spin rate and spin efficiency. Essentially, the more you cut the ball, the more total spin you’re able to generate, often at the expense of transverse spin.
This means that a high-velocity pitcher who naturally cuts the baseball may have a significantly higher raw spin rate than a low-velocity pitcher with natural arm-side run, despite not actually being better at generating spin. In other words, a high-velocity, over-the-top pitcher who is actually less able to use a combination of finger forces and friction to add spin on the ball at release could produce a higher spin rate than a low velocity, sidearm pitcher who can generate spin well.
To control for this, we created Spin+, which attempts to predict a player’s spin rate, using MLB Statcast data, based on both spin axis and velocity. This allows us to isolate only the rotations per minute generated from factors outside of velocity and axis.
Spin+ is useful because we can compare the spin rates of pitchers like Andrew Triggs—who had an average spin rate in 2018 of 2,414 rpm with just an 89 mph fastball and a completely vertical spin axis (in x-z direction) of 269 degrees—with Carl Edwards Jr.—who throws a 94.5 mph fastball that averages 2,658 rpm and an almost completely horizontal axis of 173 degrees.
Although Edwards Jr. boasted the second highest fastball spin rate of any pitcher in the big leagues in 2018 with at least 75 fastballs thrown, Spin+ believes Triggs’ ability to spin the baseball is actually ~90 rpm higher than Edwards Jr.’s, once you control for the advantage that Edwards Jr. has with regards to velocity and axis.
The main takeaway is that raw spin rate can be deceiving without additional context—particularly in physically maturing pitchers where velocity may jump periodically, and spin axis may be more volatile. In designing a pitch, it is important consider how an athlete’s spin rate might change based on the adjustments you’re trying to make. Therefore, it’s important to not only monitor the raw spin rate but the axis as well. Video can also be helpful in this case to get a better idea of how the ball is coming off the fingers.
Additionally, we can also apply the Spin+ methodology to spin efficiency, which like raw spin also shares a relationship with spin axis and velocity. In combining both internal measurements of Spin+ and spin efficiency, we’re able to gain a much better understanding of where a pitcher has the potential to improve based on his underlying data.
To highlight an example using Statcast data in the illustration below, we see the top ten fastballs in 2018 that scored highest in our “pitch potential” metric. This metric is designed to identify fastballs in the big leagues with the greatest potential to increase total movement based on a pitcher’s inherent spin characteristics. By having a pitcher’s predicted and actual spin rate alongside his predicted and actual spin efficiency percentage, we’re able to compare what we’d expect his transverse spin rate should be compared to what actually occurs.
For example, in looking at the 2018 leaderboard above, we see that Tyson Ross threw his two-seamer (FT) with an additional 347 RPMs of raw spin compared to what we would predict given the velo and axis on the pitch. With this information, we can then calculate a Spin Efficiency percentage, which expects that Ross would generate ~2,190 rpm of transverse spin on his two-seamer during the 2018 season.
However, in looking at his output for the 2018 season, we see that Ross came up about 291 rpm short of that figure and only 14 rpm higher than what we would expect an average pitcher with an average spin rate would produce at his axis and velo. This means that Ross is essentially throwing his two-seamer (and four-seamer [FF]) with just league-average movement, despite being amongst the league leaders in generating spin.
Now, in spite of leaving movement on the table, this does not necessarily mean that Ross, or any other pitcher on the list above, has a “poor” design on their fastball. Rather, as you may have noticed, most of these pitchers are sinkerballers by trade, and any increase in transverse spin would impart more “carry” onto their fastballs. By killing movement via gyro spin, they are essentially making their sinkers or two-seamers “heavier,” which almost certainly better plays to their approach of how to get batters out.
This highlights a more parsimonious relationship between spin rate, spin efficiency, and the “right” approach to designing a fastball. There really is no a + b = c magic formula where player x needs to throw a fastball with a specific axis and efficiency percentage to have more success. Rather, we need to consider the constraints of the individual alongside a proper game plan to formulate something that will work best for an athlete’s specific skill set.
As you can see, there is a lot of depth to the discussion around spin rate. The rate that a pitch spins matters, as does the axis. But the axis can change depending on arm slot and the orientation of the hand and fingers at ball release. Beyond even that, you can get even more granular when looking into MLB spin-rate data.
Your head might be spinning from the more complicated sections at the end, but there are a few key points for coaches and players.
Lastly, we need to take a data-driven approach when asking a player to make a specific adjustment on how to throw a pitch. This assures both the coach and athlete that the time and effort spent making said adjustments do not go to waste.
This takes some getting use to, but recognizing what pitches have the potential to be good or bad is the first step in using technology. Ultimately, knowing whether a pitch is ‘good’ depends not only on the spin, axis, and movement profile of the pitch, but also how it performs in game.
As a result, being able to utilize technology to objectively assess a given pitch within the context of relevant metrics is vital to get the most out of a player’s given abilities.

Great article… love the conclusion and those four bullet points, but wanted to ask how strong the relationship was between Spin Rate and Velo/Spin Axis? in my limited experience, those would not have much predictive power to Spin.
did you really delete my earlier comment? I think it’s a reasonable question to ask what kind of relationship you found from Spin Rate to Spin Axis and Velo. you lose credibility when you’re not willing to share the data and models that go into your assumptions and conclusions. Disappointing to see the deleted comment b/c generally you guys consider yourself very “data driven”
whoops… did not see that my previous comment was still awaiting moderation. it did not appear when I revisited the blog post. apologies.
hi, this is an awesome article. kind of a dumb question, but Is there a way i can access this data myself and make my own spreadsheet, similar to the ones showed in here? or is some of it proprietary data not publically available? thanks
Hey there. You should be able to find all of this data publicly available at:
https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/
https://www.brooksbaseball.net/
This is fascinating data-based insight. I have been using pitchLogic for a while now and have found it very helpful for understanding what is happening with my spin axis and spin rates. What surprised me the most was how much of my spin action was around the riflespin axis.

Laminar Express: Using Baseball Science to Enhance Two-Seam Fastballs - Driveline Baseball,2019-01-21T03:13:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/01/laminar-express-baseball-science-behind-the-two-seam-fastball/,"A “laminar express” pitch is a two-seam fastball whose term was coined by Trevor Bauer years ago when he developed a pitch that had dramatically more movement to the arm side than he previously would have had. It was the opinion of coaches at Driveline Baseball that this was happening due to the laminar/turbulent effect on a baseball, as first discussed in regarding baseball by Dr. Alan Nathan on The Hardball Times (images are unfortunately broken on this older post) in 2012, with the underlying science discovered by Dr. Rod Cross and demonstrated in this Veritasium video.
Dr. Nathan was able to derive coefficients for the components of movement with regard to acceleration when the boundary layer of air is asymmetrical:
From that, I can use the experimental relationship between the rotation rate and the Magnus force to estimate the magnitude of the latter. Since the movement is determined from the components of acceleration, and since the Magnus contribution can be estimated, the additional acceleration due to the roughness asymmetry can also be estimated.
Here is what I find for the forces, all normalized to the weight of the ball:
gravity = 1.00
drag = 0.78
Magnus = 0.32
roughness = 0.63
Boundary layer asymmetry – laminar/turbulent airflow – was responsible for quite a high percentage of acceleration change per Dr. Nathan’s calculations, which was tremendously interesting!
The science behind such movement of a baseball was exciting to analyze and actually deploy in a game situation, which Trevor was able to do after months of practice. Eric Jagers demonstrated clear evidence that two pitches that had dramatically different movement on high-fidelity high-speed video from our Edgertronic cameras could read vastly differently on a launch monitor device like Rapsodo, with the numbers being dramatically different and outside the tolerances for margin of error – driving up the statistically likelihood of the effect existing.
Eric’s trial below features a chart of two fastballs thrown with nearly identical vertical and horizontal break as measured by Rapsodo. The launch monitor detects the ball’s spin rate, spin direction, and velocity and recalculates trajectory based on a physics model – hence why it thinks both pitches shown in the video have nearly identical movement when in reality they are quite different.
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/laminar-vs-regular.mp4
You could chalk the “misread” up to an error on Rapsodo, but this is extremely uncommon on clean takes with the Rapsodo launch monitor, and when errors do occur, they almost always report missing data or seriously incorrect reads.
In December 2018, Dr. Barton Smith from Utah State University wrote about how a “laminar express” pitch might work.
The idea of a “Laminar Express” is to cause the flow on one side of the ball to be laminar, and thus have an early separation from the ball surface, while the other side is turbulent and has a later separation. The difference in these separations would cause a lateral force on the ball.
I’ve sketched the situation below. The pitch requires a 2-seam orientation, which produces large areas of smooth surface on the two sides of the ball. As I pointed out in the pressure gradient post, if a seam is near the front of the ball, it will disturb the boundary layer, but it will return to smooth, laminar flow because of the strong, favorable pressure gradient there. This is the case for the seam on the first base side near the front of the ball. The seam on the first base side near the back has no impact, because the boundary layer has already separated there.
Despite all this work and tweetstorms around the effect, it was unclear to many people – including Dr. Nathan himself – if the “laminar” effect was truly happening, and how to measure it.
So, what did we do? We decided to visit Dr. Barton Smith in Logan, Utah ourselves and subject some of our coaches to a grueling trial of throwing hundreds of pitches with the correct laminar orientation through his very specialized and expensive Particle Image Velocimetry machine.
On January 15, 2019, a team from Driveline Baseball including Eric Jagers, Kyle Boddy, Joe Marsh and Dean Jackson visited the USU Experimental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory to attempt to capture the air velocity field around a “Laminar Express” pitch. Dr. Barton Smith, Nazmus Sakib, and Andrew Smith (not pictured) took the measurements.

Joe Marsh slinging some laminar express pitches into the PIV machine.
I won’t reproduce all of Dr. Smith’s work, but I’ll post a sweet image from his PIV analysis as well as his opinion which he tweeted out:
The figure below shows a PIV dataset of one Laminar Express pitch. Note that this is viewed from above. We successfully captured 3 Laminar Express pitches during the day. All three showed an important feature: the wake is tilted upward (to the left from the pitcher’s view). In the dataset below, the boundary layer on top appears laminar, in that it separates from the ball near 12 o’clock. On the other hand, on the other side of the ball, the flow is turbulent, and remains attached to the ball far longer. The net result is a tilted wake. The pattern fits my sketch from a month ago. This ball has a downward force on it (in the data frame of reference) which is to the right from the pitcher’s frame of reference. The PIV data near the ball are poor (and there is a large region of missing data at the bottom of the ball), but this does not affect my conclusions.

It’s a rich tradition of Driveline R&D dating back a decade now to replicate results we already knew were true. Some people would call this “wasting time,” but it’s actually the soul of science to confirm things, not always seek novelty. In this case, we were pretty sure our high-speed video, launch monitor numbers, and anecdotal experience just playing catch indicated that we were right, but science generally demands a higher bar to clear. Dr. Barton Smith’s lab at Utah State allowed us the possibility to delve deeper and see the mechanism by which the “laminar express” really does work, and the results astounded all of us (except for Dr. Barton Smith, who called his shot and was basically correct).
The end result is that we know how to add additional movement not currently tracked or understood by models used by Trackman, Rapsodo, or Flightscope (all for different reasons due to different underlying technologies and assumptions, but that’s a post for another day), and that’s really damn cool. It’s not every day you get to throw baseballs in an expensive materials science laboratory and do hardcore science, finding out things that no one else has discovered, but in January 2019, a bunch of nerds from Driveline Baseball got to do just that.
[…] baseball has their own post on this study which as a lot more of the history. It’s excellent […]

"Comparing Tee, Front Toss, and Machine Swings with a Bat Sensor - Driveline Baseball",2019-01-19T04:59:05+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2019/01/comparing-tee-front-toss-machine-swings-bat-sensor/,"Blast Motion Baseball by Blast Motion, Inc. is a motion-capture sensor for the bat that measures various data points with every swing. The version that we use at Driveline measures 14 data points:

Train at Driveline
A detailed version of each of these metrics can be found on Blast Motion’s website, but most of the measurements should be self-explanatory.
As technology in baseball continues to evolve and become more accepted, Blast Motion sensors have become extremely popular because they are affordable and easy to use. Blast Motion, Inc. does a great job of making their applications accessible for players, coaches, and parents. The flow of information is seamless and combined with their industry-leading results, it is clear why they continue to be the best in wearable bat-sensor technology.
In 2016, they became the Official Bat Sensor Technology of Major League Baseball, and for the 2017 MiLB season, they were approved for in-game use at the Rookie affiliate level in the Gulf Coast League (GCL) and Arizona League (AZL). Beginning with the 2018 MiLB season, they were approved for in-game use at all levels. Their public partnership with the Houston Astros has also sparked their popularity. As the Houston Astros claimed the 2017 World Series, other teams started to take notice as Blast Motion sensors were a staple in the Astros’ hitting programs. Clearly the Astros see value in the measurements if they committed to a partnership while using the sensor in games and practice.

As all five of the Astros’ top MiLB affiliates made it to their respective league playoffs—with Double-A Corpus Christi and Triple-A Fresno making it to the championship round and Class A Short Season Tri-City ValleyCats and Class A Advanced Buies Creek winning their league titles—the rest of the MLB started to notice. Blast Motion recently announced that the Minnesota Twins will officially partner with them as well. Sensor data is becoming more widely used in the professional baseball ranks and is extremely popular among the amateur baseball crowd.
Blast Motion sensors are a regular tool in Driveline’s hitting programs. We use this technology—along with HitTrax, Rapsodo Hitting, K-Coach Baseball (K-Vest) and video—when we assess athletes. We may also use specific tools for more targeted changes throughout an athlete’s stay and retest them every few weeks. This allows us to acquire large data sets for analysis. Comparing data from these sources allows us to identify all swing deficiencies and track hitter progress over time.
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
One of my weekly responsibilities is consolidating all of the individual hitters’ Blast Motion data from the previous week and comparing it to their overall data. My main focus is to determine how well a hitter performed last week compared to his overall numbers and make adjustments for the upcoming week of training.
Of all the Blast Motion metrics, we tend focus on Bat Speed, Attack Angle, and Time to Contact. For Bat Speed, we look at an athlete’s peak, average, and median values. For Attack Angle, we look at average and median values. Only the average value is compiled in Time to Contact. From the Blast Motion website, a user is able to export all of his data in a single sheet. Using tools created by the R&D staff at Driveline, we can then quickly gather these values and compare athletes’ overall numbers to their numbers from the past week. With all of the hitters at Driveline, this gives us the essential information for our trainers to determine who is making progress and who needs to change their hitting schedule. This is a great way for trainers with multiple hitters to keep track of their progress simply and effectively.
Knowing this, we wanted to look at comparing some common practices that hitters participate in and see what the differences are in Blast measurements. This led us to the research project below, which compared metrics from hitting off a tee, front toss, and a pitching machine.
In this case study, we wanted to see how swings react when under different stressors or environments. Not every swing a hitter takes from the tee or front toss in a controlled environment is the same compared to when he faces a live pitcher. This case study attempted to simulate an in-game environment by using a machine as a substitute for live pitching.
Over the course of a day, we took twelve Driveline hitters of near equal age/skill level and split them into three groups of four. In each group, we had hitters take two rounds of ten off the tee, front toss, and machine, for a total of sixty swings using their game bat for the entire duration. The machine was set at the same velocity/distance for each of the groups for consistency, and the tee was moved each swing. Our machine setting used the average right-handed release point with an 84 mph 4-seam fastball, which simulates a 91 mph 4-seam fastball.
In our statistical analysis, we looked for overall metric summary values for each individual hitter and for all combined hitters throughout the three stations. We also ran comparison tests for the three categories to see if hitters had significantly higher values among them.
Four categories had significant differences throughout: Attack Angle, Vertical Bat Angle, Bat Speed, and Time to Contact.
Looking at the summary values, we see that Attack Angle took a near 6-degree jump from 10.88 degrees at the tee to 16.84 degrees at front toss. Attack Angle is defined by Blast Motion as, “the angle of the bat’s path, at impact, relative to horizontal.” It then went down a near 7-degrees at machine work. This may be expected in front toss since front toss is a more relaxed and controlled environment, which means that hitters will look to elevate more and put their best swing on the ball. Eight hitters had a significantly higher attack angle on front toss compared to the machine. Vertical Bat Angle, defined as “the angle of the bat with respect to horizontal at the moment of impact” or “the location of the barrel of the bat relative to the knob of the bat at impact” had 9 hitters with significantly higher front toss values than tee values.
Other notable metrics that changed were Bat Speed and Time to Contact. Bat Speed, “the observed speed of the sweet spot of the bat at impact” decreased a small amount from tee to front toss, but then noticeably dropped from front toss to the machine. Eight hitters had a significantly higher bat speed on the tee than the machine. Seven hitters also had a significantly higher bat speed on front toss than the machine.
This is expected as hitters have less time to react as pitch speed increases. Nine hitters had a significantly higher Time to Contact, “the elapsed time between start of downswing and impact,” on the tee than the machine. Higher pitch speed means less time to react. A hitter having less time to react means that his Time to Contact will need to decrease to make up for it. As a result of the hitter having to react quickly to start his swing, bat speed will decrease. This is normal and expected. It is no secret that higher-velocity pitching exposes swing weaknesses.
All of the previously mentioned metrics also bring up the fact that swings can change based on the drill. There may be different positions that a hitter’s body gets into when swinging off of a tee, compared to front toss, compared to a machine. While the Blast sensor cannot measure those changes directly—meaning we can’t say changes came from specific kinematic differences—we can see that there are differences in how the bat is moving.
We also look at the Time to Contact metric and realize that it is likely going to change based on the depth that contact is made, as well as different body movements. Hitting off a machine is likely to result in a wider range of depth that contact is made, compared to hitting off a tee or front toss.
This may help coaches think of how they are spending their practice time and what changes they are trying to make. We can break the down the types of drills that hitters often spend time working on and rank them by difficulty:
Dry Work -> Tee -> Soft Toss -> Front Toss -> BP -> Machine Work -> Live
Each drill type can be scaled in difficulty as well.
From there, we can start to look at how much time their players are spending on certain drills and then look how far away those are from live game.
Spending most of an off-season working on swing changes on the tee or in front toss may be a way for hitters to see if they’re making progress. But those changes they make may not be desirable, or practical, when they face live pitching. This means the percentage of time that hitters spend on different drills is vitally important.
This should also affect how coaches and players consider using technology to screen hitters. Coaches and players will get more accurate screening data if they can capture it closer to a live-game situation.
The goal of each hitter should be to have his best swing at every single pitch. As hitting coaches, we provide programs and implementation for a hitter to do that and transfer over those practice numbers to an in-game setting. Practice may tell one story, but hitting against live-pitching tells the real story. Blast Motion allows us to quantify swing quality, and as in-game sensor data potentially becomes more readily available at Driveline, it will be very interesting to compare it to a practice setting. Then we can conduct official research studies to quantify how live pitching truly affects swing mechanics and look at further nuances in the metrics themselves for how they may change depending on different practice situations. Conducting official research studies using Blast Motion on how live pitching affects swing quality will allow us to accurately identify weaknesses and adjust practice accordingly to maximize in-game hitting performance.

This article was written by Research & Development Intern, Griffin Gowdey and edited by Michael O’Connell
Griffin spent the 2018 MiLB season with the Buies Creek Astros, the Class A Advanced or “High-A” affiliate, in the Carolina League as a Minor League Technology Apprentice, where he was responsible for all of their in-game video and data collection as well as overseeing all of the Blast Motion sensors.
The test shows bat speed inversely correlates with pitch speed (0 to 84). Of course swing characteristics would be different, but could the slower barrel speed at moi just relate to the bat’s collision with a moving ball vs. stationary ball?
I guess you can yes that by hitting a tennis ball vs a plyo off the tee. I’ve done this before but the sensor always seems to pick up barrel speed at impact and anything after impact didn’t matter. I talked w dr Nathan Allan about this and he said contact is so fast that mass of the collision doesn’t matter. I’m not convinced but he is the expert. He can chime in if my take is inaccurate.
I have been doing the same thing for years.  I think 3-4 years ago I bought zepp which was great for video but the numbers were off.  When Blast and DK came out it changed the game.  I always noticed that my numbers and others numbers off the tee were higher by a decent amount vs soft toss then vs machine and live at bats.  This got me really wondering and developing a plan to help hitters work translate into games.  I started to see an improvement in tee numbers but it wouldnt translate into machine work or games.
Last off season and this off season I collected numbers from an MLB player.  I worked with blast, DK, and hit trax and got really into zones off a tee, zones off flips, zones off machine (hard to do), then zones in live ab (almost impossible).  What I learned was that fatigue is real and an MLB swing is VERY consistent.  He thought he swung harder off machine and live vs tee but he didnt as expected.  But it wasnt that dramatic of a difference.  Of course attack angles changed but thats expected too.   But I took this data and I compared it with Baseball Savant/Statcast data for the same zones to see if there was a correlation between bat speed, attack angle to exit velo, launch angle.  All it did was prove that the hitter had issues with fastballs up.  He got steep, he popped them up or missed, and his BABIP was under 100 for balls he was trying to hit.  So what do we do here?  Learn to lay off those pitches or plug the leak?  I think zone discipline is key so we headed to a sports vision doctor to see if there were any issues.  They we started training the eyes and focusing and target acquisition.  The we got good off season live at bats with a few former milb guys and current college guys for 5 sessions in a week.  Only time will tell if this works but at least we are working on it.
I wish I had access to a lot of high level athletes and a lab to test and track this data but I dont.  Its crazy because I have been into this data and bat fitting ideas for years.  I remember in like 2000 talking to other players about the swing and how the golf channel spent 24/7 dissecting swings and drills yet nobody talked about the baseball swing.  They thought I was nuts but here we are.  Although its different because of the tee.  If we played tee ball then we could solve hitting and optimize everything.
Good work and Im jealous you guys get to do this for a job.
Have you synced the blast swing data up with Hittrax and/or Rapsodo data as well to see how the different practice environments impact batted ball outcomes? I’m also interested in which Blast categories correlate to consistent Barrel contact.
We are working on that as a current project!
Great article on how technology is used in player development.
Hi driveline – I have two little boys and I want to get them working on their swings.  What is the best way to accomplish this?  Tee?  Front toss?  Are there any programs you would suggest for really young kids (age 4)?  Thanks!
Justin- The program we suggest for kids that young is fun and quality time spent with family, learning, experiencing, etc. Having fun hitting whiffle balls or anything to help develop hand-eye coordination is good. As your boys develop and mature with age, you can check out our Youth Axe Bat Speed System. This will come with the Axe Bat Speed Program that will include off-season and in-season programming, plus tracking sheets. We also offer an Online Hitting program and an Online Baseball Development program geared for youth athletes.
It’s awesome to see these type of analysis beginning to happen on a more regular basis. As one replier stated above and as an ex-golfer I agree, baseball/softball swing analysis is years behind golf swing analysis. I know how swing analysis through the use of technology helped my golf swing….. That said my challenge is now softball swing analysis (15 yo daughter) so any and all types of analysis conducted specific to the softball swing PLEASE feel free to send my way! Thanks for all you guys do to better the sport and the athletes.
@scottjarnac
Great article and like the in-depth analysis. Would your TRAQ software track Blast data points and then be able to aggregate that data by individual drills that are pared with overload/underload bat training?
Thanks for reaching out, Chad. This is something that we are looking to develop in the future. As of now, you can tag(over/underload) the swings in Blast and then manually enter the averages into the tracking sheet in TRAQ.
What type of drills would be used to attempt to sync the differences in swing speeds since they are off?  Is it a continuation of focusing on live BP swings?
Scott – generally, we’d recommend making sure that athletes are training in an environment representative of the challenge they face in games, by focusing on live BP type swings in practice. Simulating the reaction time of live pitches in front-toss and BP (using velocities as detailed in this table) can help with carry-over, but actually seeing game-like velocities will be essential for optimizing an athlete’s ability in this setting.

At Driveline, pitchers throw our constraint drills nearly every single day. Each drill is designed for an athlete to focus on a particular part of the pitching motion. While the pivot pickoff is a key drill for remapping arm action, you can likely see high elbow climbs in nearly every drill.
Take, for example, this video taken from behind an athlete and consider how it gives us an idea of his arm action and, more specifically, where his elbow is in relation to his shoulders.
A ‘high elbow climb’ can be defined as the humerus (upper arm) getting too high going into ball release. Technically speaking, it is called a high shoulder abduction. Below is an example of how abduction is measured:
We’ve seen, on average, elite throwers are more consistent with their shoulder abduction from front-foot contact to ball release—almost as if their elbows and shoulders rotate on the same plane as one another.
Note where he’s throwing the ball in that first clip. This is really important–he throws directly in front of his face.
Now, we’ve seen that his arm action could use some adjusting, but there are some steps to take when approaching making a change like this.
Athletes working on the Plyo Ball ® wall can often get distracted by focusing internally on how they are moving instead of having an external focus. In this case, we like to try changing the environment (with tape in this case) to see if we can get better movement out of the athlete.
Within the biomechanics reports, we obtain various kinematic metrics of the upper and lower body during the throwing motion. In this case, we are going to look at upper torso positions like elbow flexion, external rotation, shoulder horizontal abduction, and shoulder abduction in reference to other segments as they move from foot contact through ball release. As mentioned above, for shoulder abduction we typically like to see consistency from foot contact through ball release at around 90 degrees.
What does this look like on the report? Below, we’ve clipped page two from our biomechanics report that outline the athlete’s upper-body kinematic positions. Shoulder abduction is highlighted in the table with the red box, and the path the angle follows from foot contact to ball release is the purple line on the graph, outlined by the red box. As you can see, the shoulder is right around 90 degrees at foot contact and ball release and generally follows a straight line along that 90-degree path.
We’ve touched on the importance of a consistent arm path. But biomechanically, it also makes sense that we would want to have consistent movement in this plane. During the arm action, the humerus will already have to move through the transverse plane (shoulder horizontal abduction), out of scap load, and into release.
Additionally, the fastest movement in sports will also be occurring at this joint through the internal rotation of the humerus, at speeds upwards of 6,000 deg/sec. With all that movement already occurring around those two axes, throwing in additional movement of the humerus at the level of the shoulder could possibly create inefficiencies and unwanted stress.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Not all arm paths are equal. Not everyone needs to subscribe to this idea of shoulder abduction being at 90 degrees from foot contact to ball release. This is a general observation, and ultimately everyone throws a little differently. It’s also possible that a certain thrower needs to have a different abduction path due to ROM deficiencies, impingements, anthropometric differences, etc. This idea of a shoulder-abduction path comes from the average of elite throwers that we see across the board. In this case, we’re using an athlete as an example of who would benefit from an adjustment because of his performance level and other information that was gathered in his assessment.
Specifically for this athlete, he adjusted his lower-half direction to compensate for where he was throwing the ball. So, his arm action would not make the necessary adjustment. We then had to adjust his lower half to land directly ahead while still being able to hit the spot on the wall that we marked. We set him up with another piece of tape on the ground and told him he could not land on the other side of it with his front foot.
Let’s look at the second video, after the intervention
You can see the target adjustment made an improvement in how his arm unwinded. The elbow is much closer to the same plane as the shoulders.
While we saw immediate results, in that his arm action improved the way we wanted, this practice will need to be drilled often, daily if possible, to break the habit. It’s important that the athlete focuses on how it feels for him when he performs the drill correctly within the constraints, so he can reproduce it elsewhere without the constraints.
Lastly, it’s important to remember that this drill might not work forever and might not be right for everyone. As a trainer, you have to weigh the potential pitfalls of a drill and its adjustments with the potential improvements.
Here’s a great example of an athlete that we have assessment and retest data on who needed to make a similar change. When he showed up, we deemed that his shoulder abduction path “had room to improve.”
Did ya see it? It’s right there. Here let’s try a different view, maybe that’ll help.
How about now? No? To be honest, neither did I, and I spend everyday looking at these images. But when we look at the data for the shoulder abduction path, It’s pretty clear that the path of the humerus is inefficient with room to improve. This is also a great example of the value of the biomechanics reports and their ability to provide us with objective data that we sometimes might miss.
That’s quite a bit of unnecessary movement around an axis that we’d like to see stay more consistent.
This was noted in the athlete’s training profile:
“Shoulder abduction at ball release is pretty high, so really make sure to keep an eye on your arm path and make sure that your aren’t exaggerating the elbow spiral. Pivot Pickoffs are going to be the best drill to feel that.”
Data means nothing if we don’t monitor and then retest. So a few months later, following an emphasis on arm action and arm path, we retested this athlete in the biomechanics lab. It doesn’t look like much, but we made pretty significant changes.
Again, it’s hard to tell in the video, but the report is able to fill in the rest of the story for this athlete:
That’s pretty clean arm action. You can see the purple line of shoulder abduction stays fairly consistent at around 90 degrees from foot contact through ball release. Here’s another view where I’ve overlayed the assessment and retest data. The assessment data remains in color while the retest data is now black.
A few important things to note from this overlay:
Additionally, this athlete gained 5 mph from his assessment mound velocity (84 mph) to his exit mound velo session (89 mph). While also maintaining a low max varus moment from assessment (74 Nm) to retest (80 Nm).
Let’s see what the overlay looks like when we compare the motion capture of both reports:
Red: assessment
Green: retest
Again, it’s hard to see much, but here’s what the data tells us:

6 Week Research Paper Recap - Driveline Baseball,2018-12-15T00:42:32+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/12/6-week-research-paper-recap/,"We recently had an article published on a six-week training program that took place at Driveline.
The research paper compared two snapshots, six weeks apart, to see what changes (if any) occurred in the pitchers that participated. The purpose of the study was the evaluate the effects of a six-week training period. It’s important to note that the study looked at the whole program, not just weighted-ball throws.
We wanted to see what effects weighted implements (weighted balls and Plyo Ball ®), manual therapy, weight lifting, and other modalities may or may not have on shoulder external rotation, elbow valgus stress, pitching velocity, kinematics, and kinetics.
For this blog post, we summarize the main findings into sections on biomechanics, range of motion, and velocity.
Disclaimer: Before we move further, the research paper is not the “Driveline is great, always, under any circumstances forever and always” paper. That is not the function of research papers in general, nor is it the function of this paper. Lastly, research is an ongoing and ever-changing process. Therefore, be wary of anyone who claims that a single paper proves a wide-ranging set of things, including this one.
By comparing the entire group of 17 pitchers, we found four biomechanical parameters significantly changed:
If we look at the pitchers in two groups, those that gained velocity and those that didn’t, there is not a significant increase in elbow-valgus stress. The elbow-torque values that were seen in this study were also found to be in a similar range to previous studies.
None of the metrics measured at stride-foot contact were found to be different when comparing pre and post analysis.
It’s been speculated before that weighted balls work by increasing arm speed, which is more technically referred to as internal rotation and elbow extension in biomechanics. The entire group did see an increase in internal rotational velocity, but not ball velocity. But if we look specifically at the velocity-increase group, there was a significant increase in both max-internal rotation and elbow-extension velocity. This suggests that there is likely a link between an increase in ball velocity and increase in internal rotation and elbow extension.
We also found that should abduction was lower. Shoulder abduction is defined as the angle between the side of the torso and the upper arm, or humerus. It went down significantly at ball release, from 97 to 93 degrees. Although it may depend slightly on the pitcher, it is generally seen that being closer to 90 degrees at release is a positive measure.
We found that the shoulder was less externally rotated at ball release, which may be a novel finding, because we couldn’t find much research on it. It will be interested to see if this finding continues to show up, or if it was a distinct change in the group of athletes that we had in this sample.
Lastly, we saw that shoulder-abduction torque was higher. Shoulder-abduction torque can be described as the resultant torque that pulls the shoulder upward. Shoulder-abduction torque was significantly higher in the velocity-decrease group and entire sample.
There were also some changes when looked at the velocity-increase and decrease groups separately. The velocity-increase group saw an increase in maximum-shoulder superior force. The velocity-decrease group showed decreases in maximum-elbow anterior force, max-elbow compressive force, max-elbow flexion torque, and max-shoulder compressive force.
The biomechanics reports in the study were not used to change athletes’ mechanics; they were specifically an observation. It’s unknown if the comparisons would be different if the biomechanics reports were used to drive training decisions.
This also brings up the importance of looking at the average results of a whole sample compared to an individual athlete. While you can take lessons from group averages, it’s important to remember that coaches are not working with a group of 17 pitchers, but 17 individual pitchers.
Of the whole sample of pitchers, there were four range of motion measurements that were different.
First, when the group was divided into those who gained pitching velocity and those who didn’t, neither showed a significant increase in shoulder external rotation. Our initial hypothesis that external range of motion would increase was not supported.
Second, external rotation did not increase biomechanically in our pre/post comparison.
It has been previously hypothesized that weighted balls largely work through increasing external range of motion, both passively and dynamically. This is likely because more external rotation has been associated with ball velocity in previous research and weighted balls, and Plyo Ball ® are often heavier than a baseball.
We’ve previously discussed the mismatch of this belief with biomechanical information that we do have on 6- and 7-oz balls. In short, it is confusing to assume weighted balls increase external rotation, and therefore elbow torque, when 6- and 7-oz balls have been shown to result in less elbow and shoulder torque than baseballs. This relationship may change as we learn more about the biomechanical changes of heavy weighted balls.
The more interesting finding in this group was the increase in internal-rotation range of motion. This is likely due to the mobility work and manual-therapy work available to the pitchers in the study.
In previous research on throwing, it’s been more often observed that lacking range of motion, both internal and external, has been seen to increase the injury risk for throwers.
Therefore, we may view this as a positive development that external rotation was fairly stable and internal rotation increased.
This, along with other research on short-term range of motion changes, suggests that ROM is more of a fluid measurement than a permanent measurement. Of course, there will be ranges that athletes will likely stay in due to anatomical differences and humeral retroversion. But ROM will also fluctuate depending on the previous workload and may also change depending on weight-room, mobility, and manual-therapy work.
The results of this study suggest that under the proper guidance and implementation of screening and mobility work, range of motion may be able to stay in a consistent range or possibly move in a positive direction (by more internal rotation) when throwing weighted balls and Plyo Ball ® in a throwing program.
Besides the range-of-motion measurements taken in the study, athletes at Driveline have their range of motion measured as a part of their training, and those measurement are used to adjust mobility work. Therefore, this is evidence that, if measured regularly, you can have positive changes in range of motion from screening and proper targeted implementation of mobility exercises.
Of the whole sample, there was no change in velocity. Broken up into groups, 9 gained velocity and 8 lost velocity. It is important to note that the days that throws were collected were medium intent, not high intent, days. The athletes were told to throw as hard as they were comfortable throwing during the initial and follow-up sessions. While ball velocity is important it was not the main metric that were interested in examining as part of the 6-week training period.
The main focus of the study was not on velocity improvements but what biomechanical and range of motion changes (if any) would occur while doing the training. Based on previous research on weighted balls and our own results that we’ve published openly, the question on whether weighted balls can help develop velocity should be an unequivocal “Yes.”
Which means the question weighted ball research should turn to is: “Under which circumstances are weighted balls best applied?”
One thing that we did learn was how easy it is for pitchers to downregulate to a slower velocity when markered up. Therefore, velocities recorded while they threw were significantly lower than what we would see in gym clothes while throwing on a mound. This still holds true when we are having athletes throw at 100% intent; we generally see a 5 – 10 mph drop when throwing in sliding shorts with markers on compared to their best mound velocity.
As we’ve mentioned in previous articles on weighted balls (here, here, and here), each paper aims to push us further towards better results for athletes. This paper helps point us more in the right direction.
This also suggests that we need to start looking more at pairings of different kinds of training, such as mobility and weight-room work, instead of looking at them individually, because more can likely be gained from pairing those specific types of interventions.
As a part of publishing through PeerJ, all the data is available at the bottom of the link to the paper.

Priming a Hitter's Brain: EEG Case Study Part 2 - Driveline Baseball,2018-09-14T00:48:30+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/09/priming-hitters-brain-eeg-case-study-part-2/,"As more metrics become readily available for use in sport performance, we’ve seen baseball go through changes on and off the field, both strategically and developmentally. In Driveline’s never ending quest to optimize player development, one metric that we’ve started to investigate is brain activity measured through an electroencephalogram (EEG) device. While there are still some challenges with measuring neural biomarkers in movement science, measuring brain activity in sports is gaining traction as wearable EEG devices have become more practical for sports research. An article was recently published in Frontiers in Psychology stating the importance of understanding brain activity during sport performance:
Brain dynamics are at the basis of top performance accomplishment in sports – (Cheron et al., 2016)
Breaking down and understanding brain oscillations as biomarkers of performance in baseball has the potential to open another door for player development, adding an extra tool to the metrics and data already being used to validate and optimize player performance.
EEG devices measure electrical activity at the level of the brain. They are able to detect large neuron firings within the cortex at lower frequencies. In sports research, we are mostly concerned with brain activity in the beta wave frequency (12.5-30 Hz). This wave frequency is a good indicator of alertness and conscious processing. It can also be used to indicate inefficient brain activity, as we saw in our previous post where novices actually had more beta wave brain activity in comparison to the experts who had more efficient brain activity. For the sake of this project, we intended to look at brain activity in the same range. For a more in-depth review, check out last year’s EEG Case Study.
Neural noise refers to the random electrical fluctuations within neuronal networks. It has a significant effect on movement and sensorimotor control. When we collect data, whether from motion capture, EMG, EEG, or any other device, there is a “useful signal” related directly to what we are measuring. This is the signal that we care about, but that signal isn’t always clear. Often, that signal is muddied or blurred by noise, a random/sporadic or useless signal that needs to be removed/ignored in order to understand the signal that we actually care about. Think of noise as static interference that occurs on TVs. This “noise” distorts images and makes it hard for us to see what’s actually on the TV.
In his recent book, The Performance Cortex, Zach Schonbrun discusses neuroscience topics related to athletic performance and development (Schonbrun, 2018). He illustrates the concept of neural noise at length in one chapter, including a quote from early research done by Wolpert and Harris that summarizes the theory of noise interference and movement:
Movements can be described as trajectories that minimize post-movement variance in the presence of signal-dependent noise. – Harris & Wolpert, 1998
As discussed by Schonbrun, noise is present throughout all stages of the sensorimotor control loop, from sensory input to motor signal output. Through practice and familiarity of task, we are able to prepare for and adapt to this noise, improving our performance at the task. By applying this model of neuronal noise to athletes, it would make sense that athletes who elicit less noise during brain activity are more efficient with their allocation of brain resources and can perform at their most optimal level.
Flash-Lag Effect From Michael’s Visual Phenomena & Optical Illusions (Bach, n.d.)
This gif is a visual representation of the flash-lag effect taken from Michael’s Visual Phenomena & Optical Illusions. As you watch the image, you’ll observe two things:
In reality, the two lines align perfectly:
How is this possible? The answer is that your brain actually lives in the past because of the lag processing time of visual signals.
If this is the first time you’ve heard of that concept, it might be difficult to wrap your head around, but it’s actually quite simple! Basically, it’s impossible for your view of the world to be recreated in the brain instantaneously. It takes time for those images to be processed and recreated.
Light signals pass through the eyes and are focused onto photoreceptors that then convert the information into electrical signals, which can be interpreted by the brain. This transfer and process of information is where the delay occurs. There is a significant delay in the arrival of those photoreceptor signals into visual cortical areas (Nijhawan, 2002). Our brains attempt to counteract this delay and reconstruct events into a cohesive picture of the world through planning mechanisms. These mechanisms take into account processing delays that need to occur and, thus, recreate an internal model where moving objects are “perceived” a bit ahead of their assumed trajectory. The brain then plans movements and motor outputs based around this “prediction” of the world.
While the Flash-Lag effect is interesting, it is rarely studied because most daily activities occur at low speeds, where the brains prediction of the world is closely aligned with reality. However, the process of tracking a baseball pitch on the way to the plate occurs in half a second, at such a high speed that the flash-lag effect is applicable. As you track a baseball coming out of the pitcher’s hand, the prediction of what you “see” is actually just the brain’s best approximation, and not what your eye actually sees. Recreating this prediction of the world, specifically the baseballs location as it crosses the plate, requires an allocation of brain resources.
Theoretically, as you track more pitches, you’ll become more proficient at accomplishing this task. As discussed earlier, efficient brain activity can help optimize athletic performance. So, how can we use this phenomena and the concept of neural noise to prepare a hitter for success the moment they step into the box and track their first live pitch of the day? The answer may be priming and how we approach pre-game batting practice. A baseball thrown at 50 mph from 40 feet away is going to elicit a very different flash-lag effect in a hitter’s brain compared to high-speed machine BP; the latter is going be a lot closer to what a hitter sees in games.
Currently, there is limited research on EEG data and pitch tracking. There has been some work on EEG activity while tracking virtual pitches on a screen (Muraskin, Sherwin, & Sajda, 2015). Because of this, the goal of this case study was to collect EEG data on a hitter tracking pitches while in the batter’s box to begin generating EEG biomarkers of performance within hitting. We don’t really know what a good or bad EEG signal looks like while a hitter tracks pitches coming into the zone, so we can’t really compare signal between different hitters just yet. However, we can look at the amount of noise present in their signal as an indicator of efficiency and performance. We also wanted to investigate whether the signal characteristics changed following different prep work before tracking live pitches:
We hypothesized that high speed BP would be the most beneficial for an athlete based on the flash-lag effect and the principle of specificity, high-speed BP being the most similar to an in-game pitch thrown in terms of ball sped and flight patterns. We also hypothesized that the brain activity for the first live pitch of the day in the no-practice condition would be the most inefficient (noisy). We used the EmotivePro software in combination with the Emotiv EPOC+ to collect EEG data. These EEG captures were all recorded from the same hitter and taken on separate days to avoid any carryover effect between conditions.
First, we had the hitter step into the box with no prep work or practice swings to get a baseline of what EEG activity looked like for our control condition. We also had him continue to stand in for 25 pitches and recorded EEG activity on the last few pitches of the bullpen:
The images above display the EEG signal across all 14 electrodes (a high-pass frequency filter was applied to help reduce the interference of movement artifacts). We used EmotivPro’s marker feature to label separate time points during pitch tracking for analysis later; these are indicated by the 3 vertical red lines:
1st line: the pitcher comes set
2nd line: the pitcher begins leg lift
3rd line: the ball hits the catcher’s glove.
The area of interest for pitch tracking lies in the latter half of space between the 2nd and 3rd vertical lines:
As you can tell, there is a lot of neural noise present while tracking that first pitch of the day. Notice how jagged and sporadic the signal appears in the first pitch of the day compared to the 25th, indicating a significant reduction in noise. This opens the possibility that the more live pitches a hitter has seen on the day, the more prepared he will be to hit. From here, we can now compare EEG activity in pitch tracking following different prep work to these controls to identify differences:
First, pitch tracking following Tee Work: 4-5 rounds hitting off the tee.
Still a lot of noise present during pitch tracking.
Second, pitch tracking following Soft Toss: 4-5 rounds of soft toss.
Again, lots of noise present during pitch tracking.
Third, pitch tracking following Normal Batting Practice: 4-5 rounds of standard batting practice.
Large amount of noise still present.
Fourth, pitch tracking following High-Speed Machine BP: 4-5 rounds hitting off the pitching machine set up on the mound at high speed ( >90 mph)
It isn’t until we get to the high-speed machine BP condition that we see a signal with significantly less noise in comparison to the other conditions. The noise level in this condition actually appears to be lower than when the hitter had tracked 25 live pitches:
Alternatively, the signal recorded following tee work, soft toss, and batting practice appears to be more similar in comparison to the signal recorded during the no-prep work (control) condition:
While these gifs and pictures provide some insight into what’s going on during pitch tracking in a hitters brain, the comparisons made above are primarily qualitative in nature. Quantitative analysis of EEG signal is fairly complex and requires further filtering and processing. While we are currently working towards being able to run in-depth quantitative analysis to produce objective data from the EEG recordings in the future, for now, we can use EmotivPro’s band power analysis to compare amplitudes of signal within frequency bands of interest. In our case, those frequency bands will be under the beta wave range:
Both of these band power analyses were performed during the pitch-tracking region of the recording. You can see in the tee-work condition that there was significantly higher amplitudes in the beta frequency range in comparison to the high-speed BP condition, where there was barely any amplitude of beta wave activity, indicating a more efficient allocation of resources and brain activity during pitch tracking after high-speed batting practice.
This idea isn’t really that novel when we think about how pitchers use off-speed pitches to throw off a hitter’s timing. The idea behind a change-up is in its name, to change speeds. This change of speed is supposed to make it harder for the hitter to catch up to the fastball. If that’s the case, in a standard pregame batting practice where the hitter sees low velocity, we’re hitting off pitches that are significantly slower than change-ups, and they are rarely seeing anything that is similar to a game speed fastball. How can we expect a hitter’s timing, and in this case their brain activity, to be prepared and ready for a 95 mph fastball when they step into the box for the first time if they haven’t seen anything like that all day?
Does this research suggest that hitters should exclusively be using high-speed machine batting practice as their primary form of practice and training? Not at all. When training athletes, we look at the big picture and try to create significant adaptations in the long-run that are sustainable. We create individualized training programs tailored towards an athlete’s specific needs based on their assessments, with an understanding of constraint-based approaches to optimize their athletic development. This means that some athletes may not even be in a position where hitting off a high-speed pitching machine is beneficial to their long-term development at the moment. Constraint drills still have a lot of value in remapping athlete’s movement patterns and tendencies.
However, is it possible that high-speed machine BP could be used as an alternative to standard pre-game BP in order to elicit acute adaptations in a hitter’s brain? It’s quite possible, and the data above appears to suggest just that. This case study is by no means the be all and end all of brain activity research in baseball, but it’s a good start in a new frontier of baseball research and player development that’s wide open.

"Diamond Kinetics PitchTracker, Rapsodo, and Pitch Tracking Technologies - Driveline Baseball",2018-08-01T03:44:30+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/07/diamond-kinetics-pitchtracker-rapsodo-pitch-tracking-technologies/,"In previous blog posts, we’ve discussed spin rate extensively, including what it is, how it affects pitch characteristics, and how it is useful for pitch development, among other topics. For this validation study, we looked at the performance of the Diamond Kinetics PitchTracker ball in measuring spin rate, velocity, and other metrics, as compared to Rapsodo. We previously validated Rapsodo to Trackman, which you can read about here.
PitchTracker uses a “Smart” Ball paired via Bluetooth with the PitchTracker iOS app. Using an internal IMU that detects the motion of the ball, PitchTracker outputs velocity, spin rate, timing, and extension data. Pitch metrics can be viewed live on the iOS app and then stored in individual bullpen sessions, with options to tag pitch type and location.
Earlier this year, we did some preliminary investigation into the accuracy of the PitchTracker spin-rate metric as compared to Rapsodo using our Spinball Sports pitching machine. Our results were very encouraging, showing an R^2 value of .975 between PitchTracker spin rate and Rapsodo total spin, ignoring a few obvious outliers.
https://twitter.com/drivelinebases/status/984245201609740288
Given our initial findings, we decided to investigate further. We had 6 athletes throw a 10-15 pitch bullpen with the PitchTracker ball, with a mix of fastballs and breaking balls. We compared the PitchTracker readings with the Rapsodo.
First, let’s look at how spin rate data from PitchTracker compares to Rapsodo. Using linear regression (and filtering out a few clear outliers), there is a very strong correlation (R^2 = 0.9856) between the two data sets, with a trend line slope of 1.0175, indicating a near linear, near 1:1 relationship between PitchTracker and Rapsodo spin rate.
By separating pitches by pitch type, we also see similarly encouraging trends. R^2 values are 0.9737 and 0.9923 for fastballs and breaking balls, respectively, along with trend-line slopes of 1.0171 and 1.0181. This indicates that PitchTracker performs similarly against Rapsodo, regardless of spin direction or pitch type.
While linear regression is useful for showing that two variables are correlated, it doesn’t fully demonstrate the differences between the readings. In this instance, since we are looking at how two instruments measure the same variable, a Bland-Altman plot (differences vs means) is useful to illustrate systematic difference, or bias, between the two measurements.
Here, the mean difference in spin rate (PitchTracker spin minus Rapsodo spin) is 32.3 ± 22.6 RPM, meaning PitchTracker has a bias of about 32 RPM, and we can expect readings to be anywhere from 12 RPM below to 78 RPM above Rapsodo, with 95% confidence. Given that the average MLB spin rate is roughly 2200 RPM, this constitutes a relatively small bias and shows good agreement between PitchTracker and Rapsodo when measuring spin rate.
After spin rate, we also compared PitchTracker velocity against Stalker Pro 2 Radar velocity. In comparison to spin rate, velocity readings have a weaker correlation with the testing standard (R^2 of 0.8812 vs 0.9856).
By looking at the same graph but with Rapsodo velocity data, Rapsodo appears to have a slightly better correlation with Stalker (R^2 of 0.9141)
Similar to spin rate, a plot of the reading differences against the mean readings gives more insight into the validity of velocity readings. The mean difference for PitchTracker from Stalker is 0.59 ± 2.65 mph, while Rapsodo does slightly better at 0.33 ± 2.15 mph.
It appears that PitchTracker performs almost as well as Rapsodo at measuring velocity, with a slight edge to Rapsodo. Both have rather small biases and are decently accurate, but both are prone to occasionally misread velocity by 5 mph or more.
Besides spin rate and velocity, PitchTracker tracks four additional metrics: timing to plate, extension, delivery timing, and reach back to release timing. In theory, these metrics should be consistent for each athlete repeating his delivery, so we looked at the intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV), a measure of how well PitchTracker can replicate the same measurement.
The full data set can be found here.
Based on this data, the timing metrics from PitchTracker look decently reliable, with coefficients of variation under 10 percent for each athlete. The extension metric had notably higher coefficients of variation, indicating a relatively broad distribution where we would expect to see a narrow distribution.
As noted before, we had a few obvious outliers with spin-rate readings that were neglected in data analysis. Generally, almost every pitch that did register produced reasonable data. However, roughly one-third of the pitches thrown during data collection did not register on PitchTracker. Though Rapsodo also occasionally fails to pick up pitches, it misses less often and mostly on pitches well outside of the strike zone, while it was harder to predict why and when PitchTracker would miss pitches.
The Diamond Kinetics PitchTracker appears to be a viable, robust measurement tool, taking the convenient form of a leather baseball. In terms of spin rate, the consistency of readings and relatively small error surpassed our initial expectations. Though susceptible to missing pitches and occasional misreads, the PitchTracker performs very closely to Rapsodo for both spin rate and velocity, with timing metrics that appear to be reasonably accurate.
One drawback to PitchTracker is that it only measures spin magnitude, whereas Rapsodo measures both magnitude and direction. As we have have discussed before, both components of the spin vector are important in understanding pitch characteristics. However, given the low price of PitchTracker compared to Rapsodo, its capabilities are impressive and can be a useful, low-cost tool for players and coaches.
Have you compared PitchTracker’s spin direction measurement vs Rapsodo?  It would amazing if it correlated!
Yep! Check out this blog here for more information on our findings!

What was the sample size of pitches thrown for the velocity comparison?
We had athletes throw 10-15 pitch bullpens with a mix of fastball/breaking balls. Those pitches were used for the velocity comparison.
The DK website says it does measure spin direction. Your post says it doesn’t.  Have they made changes since you tested it or did I misunderstand their advertising?
Have you done a similar comparison to pitch logic?
Hey Steve, we have not tested F5’s Pitch Logic Ball yet.

A Look at Long Term Weighted Ball Research - Driveline Baseball,2018-07-19T23:58:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/07/look-long-term-weighted-ball-research/,"Weighted balls continue to be a hot topic of discussion in baseball. We’ve written about weighted-ball research before, and with new research coming out recently, we felt it was time for another update.
Many years ago, a number of studies looked at weighted balls and how using them affects velocity. The results were positive.
In 2016, there was finally a biomechanics study on weighted balls that looked at the differences between throwing 4- to 7-ounce balls off a mound and while pulling down.
The publication of Glenn Fleisig’s study on 4- to 7-ounce weighted balls was well received. We were able to learn something new about them rather than just training results.
The natural next step is to look at longer-term studies using heavier weighted balls with a wider range of programming. However, this is far more difficult because there are so many different combinations of ball weight, intensity, and frequency—not to mention work outside of throwing; mobility and strength work matter too.
The good news is there are a couple of studies looking at using heavier weighted balls in training programs.
Today, we examine one paper, one thesis, and one presentation on using weighted balls in training and conclude with some take-away lessons from reading them.

This paper took 38 athletes, between ages 13 and 18, and randomly assigned them to either a control group, which did a throwing program with only regular 5-oz baseballs or a weighted-ball group, which had pitchers complete the same throwing program as the control group with additional weighted-ball training.
The weighted-ball program followed is shown below using balls weighing 2, 4, 6, 16, and 32 ounces. Three drills were performed with each ball weight: Half Kneeling Throws, Rocker Throws, and Run and Gun.
The weighted-ball group performed the outlined repetitions with a 10-second rest between sets. The control group was instructed not to throw any under- or overload balls during this time.
Before and after the 6-week training period, pitch velocity, shoulder and elbow passive range of motion, and shoulder strength were measured. In each groups’ pre and post bullpens, the Motus sleeve was used to measure elbow torque (or stress, as Motus calls it) and arm speed.
These are the big ideas from the results section:
Both groups showed an increase in pitching velocity, but the weighted-ball group showed the larger increase.
Both groups showed an increase in elbow torque (as measured by the Motus sleeve). Interestingly, the control group had a larger increase in elbow torque than the weighted-ball group, but the difference was not significant.
We have used the Motus sleeve to measure bullpens, and our numbers have been higher than those published in this study. This is most likely because our velocities were significantly higher.
In theory, an increase in elbow torque puts a player at a higher risk for injury. However, the control group did not experience any injuries.
Arm speed increased for the control group and decreased for the weighted-ball group. As we have mentioned earlier, the Motus unit sits on the forearm, meaning it cannot directly measure internal rotation. At times, arm-speed measurements can change per pitch, as we’ve seen before. Because the sensor sits on the forearm, it can change based on the velocity of forearm rotation.
The athletes also performed a baseball-specific strength and conditioning program, specifically focusing on strengthening the external rotators. The external-rotation strength of the control group increased, whereas the training group showed no change.

The researchers wanted to specifically examine the effects on range of motion of a weighted-ball throwing program. This study included a control group and a group participating in the weighted-ball throwing program. The researchers were blinded to the group assignments of the participants.
Post-testing data was collected on 32 individuals: 20 in the control group and 12 in the intervention group. These 32 were from an original group of 57 baseball players between the ages of 8 and 17. Of the participants, 47% indicated that their primary or secondary position was pitcher. The study started off with a higher number of participants but a number dropped out. Reasons for leaving either group were not tracked.
The program lasted 10 weeks. The players in the weighted-ball group threw four days a week: two days under staff supervision at a training complex and two days on their own. The throwing programs were individualized for each athlete.
Although the throwing programs were individualized, the researchers did include general guidelines that the throwing program followed.
After the 10-week period, the only significant difference between the weighted-ball group and the control group was that the weighted-ball group showed a significant decrease in Dominant Arm Total Arc of Motion of 16.4 +/- 11 degrees. The control group showed a mean decrease of 6.2 +/- 13 degrees.
No significant differences between groups were present in the change scores for velocity, TAMD, GIRD, ERD, Dominant IR, or Dominant ER. This program did not include a specialized stretching routine; players may have stretched on their own, but they were not given targeted exercises.
The researchers mentioned several limitations, including the wide age ranges: 10-17 years old for the control and 8-17 for the intervention/weighted ball. There were also unbalanced groups, with 12 athletes in the intervention group and 20 in the control group.
They also said that alternative workouts, either lifting or other baseball work, may have been conducted during this time and affected the results. Finally, the researchers noted that the findings had low statistical power, in part because of the small sample size and the large number of participants unable to complete the study, for a variety of reasons.

*Note: The summary below is from a conference presentation, not a paper, so the analysis is shorter.
The study involved 20 college baseball players aged 18 to 22. The players had their maximum throwing distance measured, as well as their throwing velocity, shoulder range of motion abduction, flexion and external rotation. After the initial screening, players were randomly divided into two groups: a weighted-ball group and a long-toss group.
The weighted-ball group performed the following program three times a week:
The long-toss group performed the following program three times a week:
Throwing distance improved in both groups, as did range of motion; however, there was no significant difference in velocity. The long-toss group also showed the greatest increase in distance and range of motion.
The researchers also noted several limitations to the study in addition to the relatively small sample of each group: The post testing had drastically varied weather when compared to the pre-test, especially wind. The range of motion was measured by different researchers pre and post test that could have increased the error of the measurements. Internal rotation ROM was not measured, so we can not tell if there was a change in total range-of-motion. Lastly, because this is a presentation, the exact distances and measurements are not listed.
Each of these has its own strengths and weakness. But after reading each of them, there are still some lessons we can take, along with better questions we can look to answer in the future.
The first and second study supports what we have mentioned previously: doing more than two high-intensity days is too many.
High-intent weighted-ball training should at minimum be considered as much, if not slightly more, work than a bullpen.
This means that high-intensity days should be planned appropriately and without excess. High-intent weighted-ball training is a good example of something where more does not mean better.
One thing we wish the first study mentioned above had had was more information on the non-weighted ball throwing program. Whether or not we look to high-intent training with weighted balls or just for warm-ups, there needs to be a balance in throwing loads appropriately. This is especially true for high-intent throwing.
You wouldn’t find two 5-oz throwing programs and do them simultaneously, so you shouldn’t take a 5-oz throwing program and overlap that with a high-intent weighted ball program.
Weighted balls as a warm-up can be introduced along with a throwing program that includes bullpens and long-toss. However, that requires athletes to treat warm-up throws as a warm-up, so they don’t blow it out because they feel good. Second, it requires some reduction in throwing of regular baseballs before bullpens, simulated games, or long-toss.
The first 6-week study had a control-group throwing program and a weighted-ball group that did the control group’s throwing program and the weighted-ball throwing program. There isn’t any information on what the control group program was, so all we can tell is that the weighted-ball group had more volume because they did both.
When we talk about training economy, we are saying that everything an athlete does needs be accounted for; otherwise, you run the risk of fatigue or, worse, injury.
The first study mentioned found that ER strength stayed the same in the weighted-ball group but increased in the control group. Both did a baseball-specific strength program that focused on strengthening the rotator cuff, particularly the external rotators.
The no-change in the weighted-ball group, while showing an increase in the control group, may be attributed to the weighted balls requiring too much shoulder work on top of the shoulder program. It’s possible that ER strength of the weighted-ball group might have increased if the throwing volume of the weighted-ball group was decreased or the volume in the weight room and shoulder program was decreased.
We can make the example a bit simpler. Let’s say you have a high school athlete who needs to improve his squat. He’s never really squatted before, and since this is some simple mobility work, he’ll be doing front squats twice a week. Monday is a heavy day, with Friday as a lower volume and weight day to help groove the pattern. This, at the very least, should help him improve, but there can also be the risk of too much work.
Doing back squats on Monday, Zercher squats on Wednesday, and front squats on Friday with superseded goblet squats in between sets and a finisher of 100 bodyweight squats after each day is probably too much.
This means that the programming of what you are trying to improve matters a lot, whether throwing or weight room specific.
The programming of how every piece fits together is the key. This is especially true of the arm.
The second and third studies focus largely on the sets and reps on the weighted balls, but they provide little information on other throwing or weight-lifting work.
Lifting and mobility training all play a part in an athlete’s range of motion and velocity work. They should be accounted for whenever possible.
Counterintuitively, the first and second study had range of motion findings that were opposite of one another. (We’ll leave out the third study for now because the full numbers are not available, internal rotation was not measured, and two different researchers measured the pre/post tests.)
Both gaining and losing too much range of motion can be negative. Research shown that range of motion changes after one outing, after a season, while doing a warm-up, and while doing specific stretching.
Ideally, the full individual numbers would be available so we could see how high the outliers were compared to the average (the first study mentioned that two athletes who got hurt gained 10, 11 degrees of ER) in order to see if there were any commonalities, so those athletes with similar attributes could be, at minimum, screened away from that programming.
Finally, two of these studies (the first and third) had groups randomized into throwing groups. While this makes good sense from a research perspective, it makes little sense from the realities that coaches and players face.
From a coach’s perspective, he wants to take in information about a player and set him up with the best set of tools or variables available to succeed.
Not discussing these differences in approach is one of the reasons why we usually end up with researchers and coaches talking past one another—both with legitimate gripes:
Training decisions should be made based on screening. The more impactful research is going to be through communicating certain characteristics and showing coaches what to look for and what interventions can help them.
This means researchers need to realize that randomizing participants may not be the best approach, and they should loop in coaches on other ways to screen athletes. Coaches also need to get more specific in screening and tracking so they can help researchers see what real-life interventions are occuring.
Training decisions should be made based on screening. The more impactful research is going to be through communicating certain characteristics and showing coaches what to look for and what interventions can help them.
This means researchers need to realize that randomizing participants may not always be the best approach, and they should loop in coaches on other ways to screen athletes. Coaches also need to get more specific in screening and tracking so they can help researchers see what real-life interventions are occurring.
We’ve taken something away from each study mentioned today. However, it’s important to note that we still have a lot of work to do in the future. Much of this work will not be on individual items, such as weighted balls, but how multiple items interact with one another.
This idea stems from dynamic systems theory and the idea that we are looking at the interaction of systems with one another, not trying to change something from the top down.
The truth is that while we want to highlight this one mechanical position or a certain training tool as important or not, there are serious limits to eliminating other variables. Real life is all about the interaction of a large number of variables. Knowing that athletes may have 10 important variables, focusing on 4 of them, and claiming 1 of them is bad leads to serious limitations regardless of what that one thing is.
Acknowledging and attempting to measure the effects of how different variables interact is incredibly difficult, but if we don’t start trending in that direction, then we run the risk of claiming findings that make sense in a vacuum but fail in the real world.
This is why we push for open and as much data as possible so we can not only study the averages but also the outliers—along with getting better ideas of what pieces work or don’t work well together.
Single variable take: Position X results in elbow torque 1 standard deviation higher than the mean.
Multivariable take: Position X, along with positions Y & Z, results in elbow torque 2 standard deviations higher than the mean.
Or
Position X, along with A & B, results in elbow torque at the mean.
Single variable take: Introducing X into a training program resulted in no change in velocity and no change in injury rate; therefore, it is not useful.
Multivariable take: Throwing program X along with weight-lifting program Y and mobility program Z resulted in no change in velocity and no change in injury rate.
Or
Multivariable take: Throwing program X along with weight-lifting program A and mobility program B resulted in increased velocity and no change in injury rate.
Acquiring a better knowledge of how different pieces layer with each other is the key to the future of understanding how to increase velocity, get better performance, manage fatigue, and reduce injury risk. It’s much harder to do, but it is vital to helping get more research applicable to coaches.

A Closer Look at the Kettlebell Carry - Driveline Baseball,2018-06-22T02:10:54+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/06/closer-look-kettlebell-carry/,"Recently we released our first peer-reviewed study at Driveline Baseball, titled “Surface Electromyographic Analysis of Differential Effects in Kettlebell Carries for the Serratus Anterior Muscles.” Now, the title is a little long and perhaps challenging to understand specifically what we studied. So with that in mind, let’s take a little time to explain the thought process behind the study and the impact it has had on how we train our athletes.
The Kettlebell Carry (KBC) is an exercise that has been programmed in gym as part of our recovery routine. It’s also one that has typically been performed in myriad ways depending on where you train. Historically, at Driveline we’ve performed them at 90 degrees of horizontal abduction. We wanted to compare the 90 degree position to a new position, approximately 45 degrees. An EMG sensor was placed on the serratus anterior to measure the difference between the two positions.
The serratus anterior serves as a prime mover for scapular upward rotation and a key muscle in scapular stabilization, two components for reducing injury risk and improving rotator-cuff function. It’s also a finicky piece of musculature that tends to lose function in both athletes with pain and those who are symptom free, but don’t move well. For these reasons, we take time after throwing to take care of this muscle in order to keep it functioning properly.
Prior to our study, we could not find literature on what arm position elicits the greatest amount of serratus activation during the KBC. Therefore, the goal of the study was to determine with minimal coaching which KBC position provided the highest amount of serratus anterior activity.
We used two positions: approximately 45 and 90 degrees of horizontal abduction. Our subjects split into two groups and had surface EMG sensors attached to their serratus anterior muscles. Once ready, we had one group perform a 90-degree KBC, take a short break, and then perform a 45-degree KBC. The other group followed the same procedure but in reverse order.
Our results found that the 45-degree KBC produced a significant increase in EMG activity for the serratus anterior in this position compared to the 90-degree KBC. This suggests there’s a better chance of the 45-degree carry impacting serratus function and strength. As a result, during our recovery work at Driveline, we have shifted from using the 90-degree KBC in favor of 45-degree KBC instead.
Also of note from this study is that technique was not heavily coached. This allowed us to see the levels of activation prior to any major technique intervention from a trainer. However, when we coach our athletes, we look for several things:
If you are interested in learning more, read the full in-depth look at the KBC study and the science behind it.
HTKC still has waiter walks at 90 degrees. I’m guessing we should switch this to 45 now?
How long do you carry? Timed or distance?
A good mark for the Kettlebell carry is 40 yards at a normal walking pace.

"Kershaw, Sliders, Statcast: An Analysis of the Slickball Theory - Driveline Baseball",2018-03-29T22:59:54+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2018/03/kershaw-sliders-statcast-analysis-slickball-theory/,"Among talks of collusion, an ineffective player union and a growing discrepancy between contenders and non-contenders, this is as opportune time as any to relive the brow-beaten subject of the slickball theory. In case you missed the 2017 World Series, this has been touched upon here and here and a number of other places Google could tell you about.
However, if you have read one or two or all three hundred of those articles, you may share my feelings of being a little unfulfilled or still unsure of where and what exactly did change with slider-dependent pitchers and pitches. There certainly does seem to be quite a lot of smoke, but is it one main large fire or a series of metaphor-inducing sources of flames?
Here I aim, rather than to just re-open the conversation, to redirect it from a few new angles, both in terms of mechanical changes and binned results. As such, I will briefly glance over the league wide trends and then look in more detail at the tendencies and results of a well-known slider-heavy pitcher who had multiple World Series starts and goes by the name of Clayton Kershaw.
Here are some specifics we’ll cover below, so this is a last chance for a few of you number-averse readers to bail:
Let’s commence with our race to one conclusion that’s worth a thousand graphics. (That’s the idiom, right?)
Looking at the Statcast data scraped off Gameday directories, we’re pooling the spin rate and spin direction for all pitches thrown in 2017, split up by the regular season, post season (inclusive), and world series (exclusive). For the sake of cogency, we’re going to be using and re-using a lot of abbreviations: I apologize in advance for any confusion about using SD to indicate spin direction when it might pop out as the more naturally at ease abbreviation for standard deviation.
We probably don’t need to spend too much time convincing anyone that the distribution seems markedly different in the postseason and world series vs the regular season.
Now, a slider would often be the pitch most affected by potential “slickness”. So, repeating the seasonal splits, we stayed with the spin rate (a more statistically stable rate to look at rather than spin direction) and split up the graphs between sliders and non-sliders.
Again jarring contrasts, and jarring contrasts in the slider categories where there seems to be a very significant shift in the mean: these R plots even auto-generate different shifting scales for the RPM.
Here’s a numerical sampling of the results.
A very casual overview: the spreads seem to get tighter with the Slider pitches specifically in the postseason; a Fisherian perspective on these numbers seems to paint a very staunchly significant difference. If you’re not a disciple of frequentist statistics, then a complementary Bayesian perspective would also be damning – dependent, of course, on your sensible choice of prior distributions.
Now, a quick look at all the visualizations we’ve seen, but this time for our slider-loving friend, Kershaw.
[tabby title=”Spin Direction / Spin Rate”]
[tabby title=”Slider Spin Rate vs. Non-Slider Spin Rate”]
[tabbyending]
Let’s take this moment to introduce a new quirk in the mix.
As has been heavily discussed by sabermetricians and keen observers of baseball statistics everywhere, MLB has introduced the Statcast TrackMan radar over the previous Pitchf/x cameras as the leading provider of measurements in the last few years, and 2017 specifically marked the year Statcast became the official leading face of metrics: MLBAM officially switched to TrackMan. While Pitchf/x’s cameras begin tracking pitches about five feet away and rely on a set of 20 images, TrackMan is in a perpetual journey of thousands of snapshots of the pitch, bringing, in theory, greater precision and ability to the table.
Due to Statcast’s fairly new status and limited public access, there have been known errors among initial Statcast tracking, most notably errors in vertical and horizontal pitch movement although the errors were acknowledged as an improving work-in-progress due to Statcast’s learning potential and the continued commitment of the Statcast developers. In fact, a (very) recent study by Gerald Schifman commits just this fact to light: errors for Trakman readings have certainly decreased on metrics like horizontal/vertical location and movement, although they are not quite unilaterally better across the board than the older Pitchf/x data.
In addition, a huge difference is especially notable when it comes to Pitchf/x vs Statcast in the premise of this article: The already-much-bandied-about Pitchf/x spin rate.
The TrackMan system has the ability to measure the “observed” [0] spin rate, which can be seen as a summation of the pitch’s “useful” spin (where the spin axis is perpendicular to the direction of the pitch) and its gyro spin (or where the spin axis is aligned with the direction), where Pitchf/x only notes down the former number, which it calculates based on the trajectory of the pitch. This will result in Statcast’s spin rate potentially being a much different number.
However, the spin rates we presented above from the MLB Gameday’s raw TrackMan data are different not just from Pitchf/x data but also from one of the leading faces of Statcast data, Baseball Savant.
Baseball Savant, the most prominent result following a search for “statcast data”, is self-marketed as  “a site dedicated to…Statcast metrics.” Yet, after using their Search function to output Kershaw’s 2017 data, we find a few stark differences. In fact, here are the same seasonal splits of the breakdowns for spin rate by Savant for Kershaw.
Does this invalidate the TrackMan conclusions we’d previously drawn? Not necessarily; looking at the raw, unaltered data places everything on the same scale after all. But this raises a bigger question: why are two different interfaces, both based on Statcast’s TrackMan as a data source, spitting out different numbers? And just how different are they across the board?
It’s been covered before how Statcast is undergoing constant changes to better its data output and measurements. It’s, predictably, a little more closeted about what exactly these changes are. Requests from Driveline Baseball’s R&D Director on this subject went unanswered.
(Historical requests for where this data lives have also been ignored by MLBAM’s representatives.)
That being said, given that the greater wealth of data we have comes from the raw MLB Gameday interface, it seems highly pertinent to suppress newly festering qualms about which data source to play with in exploring how the nature of Kershaw’s pitches changed across the season. Especially relevant is seeing where and how the two different tracking systems differ, when it comes to movement and location.
Looking at the roughly 3000 pitches Kershaw threw in the regular season and postseason combined, a simple match performed on the unique date/time-indexed stamp of when the tracking system first detected the pitch in the air, managed to match over half of Kershaw’s unique pitches across both sources. This is no mean accomplishment, as MLB Gameday and Baseball Savant defer even in the exact number of total pitches Kershaw threw over said season (3025 from Gameday versus 2931 from Savant).
(Although looking at easily verifiable examples, it seems Savant does a much better job of tracking these pitches, with its convenient ability to backtrack and correct.)
Given the 1500+ individual pitches that we can match, I decided to take this opportunity as a chance to measure the similarity of the descriptive matching data fields in both Gameday and Savant, something that I have had trouble finding verifiable results for online.
We looked at the following metrics that are present in both tracking systems and help describe individual pitches: start speed, x0 and z0 (the horizontal and vertical location of the pitch at the initial release point, respectively), pfx_x and pfx_z (the horizontal and vertical movement of the pitch between the release point and home plate), px and pz (the horizontal and vertical location of the pitch when it crosses home plate), vx0 and vy0 and vz0 (the velocity of the pitch in three dimensions at the release points, ax0, ay0 and az0 (the acceleration), sz_top and sz_bottom (the top and bottom of the strike zone), and the spin rate.
We also looked at two differences of similarity measure: the commonly used Euclidean distance and normalized Euclidean distance, the latter to account for the different magnitude of certain metrics (i.e. speed vs a pitch movement metric).
Here are the results.
As expected, spin rate is colossally different. Most of the other metrics don’t seem too incredibly different (keeping in mind that we have an 1500+ sample size that boosts up the non-normalized metric). The velocity and acceleration metrics we don’t touch upon in this piece, and the horizontal and vertical movement we’ll also stay away from as those seem to speak to some potential measuring differences.
In addition, among these 1500+ pitches, 78 pitches were classified differently between Gameday Statcast and Savant Statcast. Further breaking it down below, we see that 59 of these pitches were classified as Sliders in Gameday (column labels) while falling into either four seam fastballs (48) or change ups (10) for Savant (row labels).
Is there anything unique about these pitches that the two systems seem to be disagreeing on? Looking at the 58 pitches we mentioned before (all sliders in Gameday and FF’s or CH’s in Savant), we surveyed the descriptive statistics of a few aforementioned metrics.
It appears that, at least in these cases Gameday is deploying a more sensible pitch type selection based on location and movement. We will pursue Gameday’s metrics for those pertinent analyses, although again the differences across the whole sample size are not large.
First then, we look at where the pitches actually ended up. The level of hitting in the postseason is better by any sort of common sense or statistical rationale, but was it a result of the hitters hitting the same pitch in the same spot? Or did the pitches, specifically the slider, look different?
The above tables are segmented by the Gameday value of px and py, which indicate the horizontal and vertical location of the pitches respectively. We tossed out any obviously wild pitches or pitches well outside the strike zone: we filtered out pitches more than 2 feet inside/outside from the center of the plate, below 0 feet (i.e. bouncing), or above 5 feet. The first set of plots compare the locational difference for all pitches between the regular season and postseason; then sliders specifically, then a set of the differences (regular season minus postseason) for both all pitches, and sliders.
It appears at a glance that pitches might have shifted over from between 0 and 2 to 0 and -2 px, or from outside to inside. Let’s hold on a moment though and break it down for the type of batter Kershaw is facing.
More particularly, looking at Kershaw’s splits against LHB vs RHB we see a few stunning differences in px indices, particularly against RHB where he appears to start throwing to the other side of the plate. Here are the means for these px indices for all pitches, and then controlled for sliders specifically:
So it appears that pitches, and sliders in particular, are ending up in different locations, yes. Now let’s see if this has any impact on the actual result of the pitch.
We looked at changes in pitch event outcomes based on pitch type across our by-now-familiar three-way seasonal split. We looked at differences through four different lens: the frequency of batter swings across all events, the frequency of recorded strikes across all no-swing events, the frequency of contact among all swing events, and the wOBA generated by the opposing batter across all swing events. The number of changeups and two seam fastballs that Kershaw threw was quite small (as you’ll see depicted lower down in another graphic) so we focused on his three main offering of curveballs, four-seam fastballs and sliders.
Keeping in mind that the World Series sample size is smaller than the Postseason and much smaller than the regular season, a few observations:
It looks like Kershaw had the biggest discrepancy in batter performance with his curveball and slider.
For both sliders and curveballs, he got fewer batters to swing at his offerings in the postseason and these batters generated a much higher frequency of contact when they did swing (for the exclusive postseason splits on curveballs, CU actually generated less contact). While Kershaw was more efficient at getting called strikes for his regular season curveball, he actually was more successful getting called strikes in the postseason with his slider. However the typical slider, and especially Kershaw’s, isn’t intended as a pitch to freeze hitters—hence the low rates of called strikes across all splits. In fact, the increasing ratio of called strikes might speak even more to the changing location of the slider.
Interestingly, the wOBA on slider-generated swings decreased in the postseason, while it increased for his curveballs and four-seamers. However, when accounting for all swings, Kershaw still recorded a lower wOBA in the regular season.
His fastball seemed to induce a similar amount of swings across the season splits (slightly more in the regular season) and a similar amount of contact, with the lowest wOBA against in the postseason.
Now, bringing in some Statcast batted ball data from Savant, we can look at just how hard his main three offerings were hit after the calendar flipped to October.
So, a few mixed signals in there but it does seem like there are differences, with perhaps the most dichotomous split existing with fewer induced swings on sliders and much more contact and harder contact when the slider is swung at, in the postseason. (It’s also important to note that a true rigorous analysis of the wOBA figure would require hitting park factor adjustments, correction for the superior level of hitting faced in the postseason, etc.)
Now if we do believe the nature of Kershaw’s pitches (specifically his slider) is changing, let’s look to see if Kershaw himself changed his pitch type based on certain situations, perhaps out of a conscious (or subconscious!) desire to adjust for these differences.
In the next plots we see first a comparison changes in pitch usage across the regular season vs postseason (for both of our Statcast-based data sources), and then, consequent changes in said pitch usage based on in-game situational circumstances.
The pitch usage change here comes as a percentage of times it was used in the regular season minus the percentage of times it was used in the postseason. The two systems seem stumped when it comes to how often exactly slider usage changed for, although as we covered above, perhaps Savant’s slider classification isn’t always the most accurate and we should trust the raw TrackMan data’s proposition that slider usage declined in the postseason. Everyone, however, seems to agree that curve usage has gone down, with Kershaw relying more and more on his fourseamer.
Now, diving a little deeper, we look to see if these changes have led to Kershaw being more or less likely to use certain pitches in different dynamics. We looked at these pitches under two different lens: a) early versus late in the game (where we encoded “late” as the 6th inning and later on) and b) the bases being empty versus the lead runner being on first, second, or third base. The pitch type classification used here was, as previously unless otherwise noted, pulled from MLB’s Gameday.
The early/late split seems to have been non-impactful in pitch usage but the second split speaks to a more unfortunate combination: Kershaw seems to have used more (or less! If you believe Savant) sliders in the postseason, but definitely had to resort to them more than ever with men on third base, just as his slider’s spin rate (maybe) and effectiveness (definitely) plummeted.
Hmmm.
A lot has been said about the slickball theory and a lot has been said about the changes ushered in by Statcast, but that is because there is a lot to say about both. Here’s to hoping we’ve confused the few that had a resolute, firm grasp of what was going on. Cheers, l’m excited for the new season as well.

Driveline Baseball Review - College Summer Training Results 2017 - Driveline Baseball,2017-09-14T00:50:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/09/driveline-baseball-review-college-summer-training-results-2017/,"This summer we saw 250+ pitchers in our gym from May to September. Of those, we have 152 pitchers to compare pre- and post-bullpen velocity and Motus sleeve data to see the effects of weighted-ball training.
The first day athletes were in the facility they were asked to throw five fastballs off a mound to get baseline measurements. We have since been able to compare those five fastballs to the five fastest fastballs in a pitcher’s last bullpen session in the facility.
Every pitcher was screened for movement and performance markers during their second day in the facility. They then had personal meetings with our trainers to review what their goals were for their time at Driveline.
Here is the on-board bullpen data compared to the last bullpen an athlete threw in the facility.
This list includes athletes who had their last bullpens in the gym from June 1 through September 1.  The first few athletes included had started training before the beginning of June but had their last bullpen in the middle of June. If an athlete threw multiple bullpens, we used the data from the last bullpen they threw in the facility.
We saw velocity increase as well as elbow stress but, in a way, mStress decreased slightly. Essentially, velocity and elbow stress (or torque) increased proportionally. We saw an overall decrease in arm speed and arm slot, while shoulder rotation increased. If you are looking for more of an explanation, we’ve gone into detail on the Motus Sleeve’s metrics in an earlier post.
Here is the bullpen data broken down by length of stay.
Below are the individual mound improvements of all 152 athletes.
We can also see what the relationship was between a pitcher’s peak pulldown velocity and their peak mound velocity.
Below is this years pulldown and mound data compared to last year.
You can find the 2016 summer review and data here.
The 2017 summer data can be found here.
Would be great to see the Individual Mound Improvements grouped into say three pie charts based on Under 2, 2-4mph and Over 4mph and those pies then split up based on onboard bullpen velocity ranges.  I would think there must be not only a coorelation to length of stay in improvement but also that lower onboard velocity pitcher are most likely to see the most opportunity for improvement?

How to Use the Motus Sleeve - Driveline Baseball,2017-08-13T09:57:50+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/08/use-motus-sleeve/,"We have been using the MotusBASEBALL Sensor to great success over the last year, and it has been able to bring biomechanics measurement from the lab to the amatuer coach and player.
Because of our success using the MotusBASEBALL Sensor, we felt it would be helpful to provide some more information on how we’ve used the sensor so far.
During the 2016 Saber Seminar, Mike Reinold presented that the MotusBASEBALL Sensor has an intra-class correlation (ICC) value of 0.99 for valgus/varus torque vs stress when compared with the American Sports Medicine Institute’s lab in Birmingham, AL. We have since confirmed those findings with Glenn Flesig, head of ASMI biomechanics research.
There is also a validation study comparing the MotusBASEBALL Sensor readings to the readings of a marker-based biomechanical laboratory. The study found that the MotusBASEBALL readings were within 5% of the marker-based laboratory readings.
So we have evidence that the MotusBASEBALL Sensor is valid when compared to different labs. Testing is scheduled for Q4 2017 – Q1-Q2 2018 in the Driveline Research Lab as well. We hypothesize that there will be differences in magnitude at the high end, but that the general trend of valgus stress will hold.
Besides the sensor, you are going to need a phone to run Motus’s app and a sleeve to put the sensor in.
There are two options for setting up profiles to collect readings: a player’s account and a coach’s account. Both operate under the same guidelines, but the coach’s account allows you to track data for multiple athletes.
If you are opening a player account, then you only need to pair with a MotusBASEBALL Sensor once.
If you have a coach’s account, you will need to pair a sensor with each new athlete you create. It’s a straightforward process that doesn’t take much more than a minute to set up for each athlete.
First off, it’s important that you wear a sleeve that tends more towards fitting too tight rather than too loose.
The MotusBASEBALL Sensor is accurate when it’s worn in the right spot and stays there.
A looser sleeve leaves open the possibility that the device may move when an athlete throws. A looser sleeve can cause the sensor to rotate in place or slide down or around the side of the forearm. Any of these issues will cause the readings to fluctuate.
Since the arm moves incredibly fast during pitching, it’s best when we know for sure that the sensor stays in the same spot.
After you find a sleeve of the appropriate size, then you’re going to want to make sure that the sensor is in the correct position.
Remember the sensor is only going to give valid readings when it is positioned and used as intended.
The proper placement for the sleeve is two-finger widths below the medial epicondyle (think funny bone) of the elbow. If a pitcher is standing with his arm stretched out and his palm facing upwards, the sensor should be on the medial side of his forearm.
There is also a short video under the ‘help’ section of the Motus app that explains how to properly put on the sleeve.
Picture from the Motus app, showing proper placement of the MotusBASEBALL sensor.
The top metric on the app, Stress, has been validated in one lab measuring peak valgus elbow torque and has a 0.99 intra-class correlation to ASMI’s torque measurements. This is the torque (or stress) that occurs on the elbow during a throw. As noted before, we still don’t know the exact relationship between elbow stress and injury risk.
The Arm Speed metric gives a measurement of angular velocity of the forearm. Because the sensor sits on the forearm, it isn’t a direct correlation to internal rotation or elbow extension measurements you would get from a biomechanics lab.
This means that some athletes who heavily pronate, on 2-seam fastballs or changeups, can read higher arm speed than 4-seam fastballs because of the emphasis of “turning over” the forearm.
The Arm Slot is the measure of the angle of the forearm makes with ground. A direct, sidearm motion would read as zero degrees, a true three-quarters arm slot would read at 45 degrees.
The Shoulder Rotation metric is the maximum angle that the forearm externally rotates during the throw. This is also measured from the ground, so there will be some differences in shoulder rotation between throwing off a mound and throwing off of flat ground.
Arm Slot and Shoulder Rotation are the two metrics that are going to be most sensitive if the sensor rotates in the sleeve because they are both measured in relation to the ground.
You are going to want to change the ball weight if you are throwing with weighted balls and the height and weight of each athlete.
Changing the weight of the ball being thrown is done by “tagging” the pitch, which is also used to mark certain pitches for later reference.
If the throws are tagged with an underload or overload ball, it will affect the values from the sensor, so the user must make sure that the tagging is accurate.
A pitcher throwing a baseball under different weighted ball tags.
Changing the height and weight of the athlete, in addition to handedness, is done within the account being used on the app. After selecting the account name on the top of the screen, there are several athlete attributes that can be adjusted.
Imputing an athlete’s height and weight: 6′ 1″ 211
Same athlete, now listed at 6′ 7″ 211
This is going to change the readings because studies have shown that both height and weight have a relationship to arm torque. We have mentioned this before in previous articles, but taller athletes are most likely going to have longer arms when compared to shorter athletes, which is going to cause different readings in a lab.
This is also the main reason why torque and arm-speed measurements in biomechanics labs (valgus torque, internal rotation and elbow extension) change with age. Athletes grow taller and their arms grow longer, which means that elbow torque and arm speeds change. So the Motus app accounts for these differences.
When an athlete is wearing the sensor in a training environment, it is a best practice to check in with him every few pitches to make sure the sensor hasn’t moved.
The app will keep a log of the metrics that the sensor provides, but it is unable to calculate the miles per hour of the throw.
If you are looking to collect the velocity of each, or certain, throws, then it is best to have a computer and spreadsheet to track the velocities. We find it easiest to write down the velocity of each throw and the MotusBASEBALL Sensor metrics at once. We find this easy to do in Google Docs but it can be done in any spreadsheet.
If you aren’t interested in the velocity of each throw, you can look at the measurements of each by clicking on the chart button under the workload tab. It can be difficult to distinguish which throw matches up with which measurement, but tagging different throws can help with this. The chart can also give you a good idea of the changes that occurred over the course of a bullpen.
If metrics seem to change drastically from throw to throw, this is most likely coming from movement of the sleeve. If the sleeve falls down the arm, all of the readings will change. If the sensor somehow rotates in its slot, then the Arm Slot and Shoulder Rotation measurements will change.
This is why it is so important to monitor the athlete wearing the sleeve to make sure it has the proper placement.
We’ve enjoyed using the MotusBASEBALL Sensor in house and we look forward to continuing using it in the future.

Front Side Glute Data in Pitching - An EMG Pilot Study - Driveline Baseball,2017-07-27T22:24:40+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/07/front-side-gluteus-maximus-emg-pilot-study/,"Let us start by recalling an earlier blog post about efficient front leg mechanics and what they do for the throwing motion, and velocity. In this post, we talk about how the front leg has the job of “slamming on the breaks” [1] and stopping the momentum of the body allowing for maximal momentum transfer to the arm. When a pitcher uses his back leg and the pitching rubber to give their body momentum towards the plate, the next step in their delivery is to use as much of that momentum to their advantage. Lead leg blocking is the mechanism that does this for a pitcher by stopping the motion of the front side of the body while the rest of the pitcher’s body and arm moves or “catapults” around it, toward the plate. In order for the front leg to stop the pitcher’s front side from moving towards the plate, it must not only make good contact with the ground, but extend and apply a hefty force against the motion of the body. A study using force plates on the front and back leg found that front leg ground reaction forces show a strong significant correlation to pitch velocity [2].
This is where the gluteal muscles come into play, to assist with extension, which is what leads to the force against the body. As a pilot study with another one of our biomechanical analysis tools, EMG sensors, we take a look at the front side gluteus maximus (GM) activation in a few handfuls of college and professional pitchers here at Driveline.
Glute EMG Data Collection
Figure 1: Image of data being received from the EMG sensor from the iPad, while staff member tracks velocities and other notes on movements during the velocity workout
EMG, short for electromyogram, is defined as the monitoring of the neuromuscular activity in a muscle, which can be used to measure muscle activity, muscle tension and muscle fatigue, in addition to being correlated to force produced by a muscle. This signal can be measured in several different ways. Two of these methods are called Needle EMG and Surface EMG. Needle EMG is executed by inserting two or more  metal needle electrodes that are connected to their own respective wires (sometimes called leads) into the muscle of interest in addition to a reference, or ground, electrode. Surface EMG is collected by applying the electrodes onto the skin along the length of the muscle in the form of gel stickers. This method is much less invasive and much more mobile, which allows for a wider range of applications. Both types of EMG send the signal to a collection device in which the data is either stored or just formatted and exported for storage and analysis.
In this case, the device we use for Surface EMG data collection is a very low-profile sensor called the Cricket, by Somaxis. This device is not only compact, but wireless, which makes it ideal for our purposes of collecting EMG data while moving with wide ranges of motion or just too violently for a setup with hard wire connections. This device is applied to the skin along the length of the muscle of interest, and is secured by a butterfly electrode. The sensor itself clips directly in between the two ends of the electrode, eliminating the need for any wire connections. The data that is received by the EMG sensor is sent to a mobile device, an iPad in our case, to be recorded and stored/exported.
Somaxis Cricket EMG
Figure 2: Image of the Cricket sensor attached to the butterfly electrodes and placed on an athlete’s forearm for EMG data collection.
To be able to effectively use the data that is collected using the Somaxis Cricket sensor and for it to be widely accepted, the technology must be validated. A short validation experiment is necessary to show the reliability and accuracy of the data that is collected by the sensor. This validation can and has been done for devices on muscles using isometric contractions of various levels of intent [3]. Usually, the results from the sensor are compared to a “gold standard,” but without access to an accepted stationary surface EMG collection device as a gold standard at this time, validating the consistency and reliability characteristics of the data in addition to comparing it to muscle force will be sufficient.
From what we know, handgrip strength can be correlated and estimated using surface EMG on the forearm extensor muscles [4,5]. Using this knowledge, a quick validation can be done by comparing handgrip strength, collected by an electric hand dynamometer, to the EMG signal on the extensor muscles bundle in the forearm. For the sensors to be validated, the EMG signal that is collected should show a positive correlation with muscle force, and the data should be consistent and reliable enough in terms of connectivity.
Figure 3: Image of sensor placement and Cricket validation setup used for correlating grip force and forearm extensor muscle EMG.
For this experiment, 5 subjects wore an EMG sensor during a grip strength exercise while gripping a dynamometer at 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40% of their maximum rating of perceived exertion (RPE). The skin on the testing site of their forearm was prepared using an alcohol swab, allowed to dry, and then the sensor was placed along their extensor bundle forearm muscles. After the EMG recording was started, the subject performed a contraction at 100% RPE followed by the four levels of intent in decreasing order for two seconds (100%, 80%, 60% and 40% RPE). The recording was ended after a total of 5 contractions were performed, the sensor was removed, and the electrodes were discarded.
The data was filtered with a high pass butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz and analyzed. The mean and max EMG amplitudes were measured for each contraction, as well as the mean frequency. No normalization was done in this case, only straight-forward regression analysis on grip force versus these three metrics.
Figure 4: Time domain signal of a Cricket Sensor validation trial with the EMG activity of the forearm while performing grip strength exercises at 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40% RPE, respectively.
Without normalization, grip force vs. mean amplitude of the EMG signal during the forearm contractions showed a r-squared value of 0.532, meaning grip force accounted for over 50% of the variance in the mean EMG amplitude during the contractions. The r-squared value for the grip force versus max amplitude and mean frequencies are 0.458 and 0.118 respectively. The p-values for the correlation of grip force vs. mean and max amplitudes are 0.0000213 and 0.000123 respectively. Mean and max amplitudes both show a significant positive correlation with grip force to one percent significance, but mean frequency did not show a significant correlation.
Correlation Plot for Grip Strength
Figure 5: Correlation plot comparing the Mean Amplitudes of the EMG signal for the Grip Force of several subjects.
As expected, the EMG signal’s mean and max amplitudes during the forearm contractions showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the grip force, validating that the data received from the Cricket Sensors are reasonable and therefore valid. The consistency of the data collected is shown by the consistent positive correlation between all subjects as shown in Figure 5, and the reliability is shown by the clean quality and lack of disconnection between the sensor and the mobile device as shown in Figure 4.
For the front side gluteus maximus study, a mix of 20 college and professional level pitchers were asked to wear a Cricket EMG sensor on their front side gluteus maximus while they all perform the same workout. The workout is a bullpen with 2 – 3 sets of 5 fastballs at maximum intent, totaling to between 10 and 15 fastballs per trial. The skin on the application site was prepared using an alcohol swab before the sensor was placed. The Cricket sensor was placed on the gluteus maximus with the electrodes running alongside the belly of the muscle.
Figure 6: Image of staff members applying EMG sensor to a pitcher’s front side gluteus maximus
Following the placement of the Cricket sensor, the electrodes and sensor itself were covered with Rock Tape to prevent electrical conduction and additional motion artifact from the athlete’s clothes. Before the athlete began their workout, a MVIC was recorded by performing a “PRONE” position contraction in which the athlete was asked to lay on their front, flex their knee to near 90 degrees, and lift their foot towards the ceiling of the building against the bodyweight resistance that was applied to the bottom of their foot or posterior thigh/hamstring area for 2-3 seconds as shown in figure 7.  The athlete was then asked to complete their workout while the live EMG data was monitored to ensure proper wireless connection and reasonable data. After the workout was finished and the data recording was ended, the athletes were asked to remove the sensor, and the electrodes were discarded along with the Rock Tape that was covering it. The Cricket sensor was wiped with a disinfectant and stored for the next use.
Figure 7: Image of MVIC in the “PRONE” position being performed. The data from this baseline is used to normalize the data, so that the EMG data can be compared between subjects.
After placing the EMG signal for the whole session into a directory in R, a script was run to filter and analyze the bullpen session EMG signal. The signal was filtered with a high pass butterworth filter with cutoff frequency of 10 Hz. After the signal is filtered, windows of 2000 samples were placed around the events, in which the mean and max amplitudes as well as the mean power frequencies (MPF) were all calculated within that window. All three of these values are recorded for each spike to be outputted and saved for analysis. In addition to these three metrics, each window is plotted for visualization which helps with qualitatively ruling out misreads. The data for all of the pitches for each player was stacked into the same data sheet, and read into R for simple regression analysis.
The logarithm to base 10 of maximum EMG amplitude of the gluteus maximus during the pitch normalized to the athlete’s MVIC, and the mean EMG amplitude showed significant positive correlations with pitch velocity with significance to 1% and 10% respectively. They had r-squared values of 0.0644 and 0.0423 respectively. This means that normalized maximum EMG amplitude of the pitch explained just over 6 percent of the variance in the pitch velocity when looked at by itself, while the mean EMG amplitude of the pitch explained just over 4 percent of the variance in pitch velocity when looked at by itself. The mean frequency as calculated in this case study did not show a significant correlation with the pitch velocity.
Figure 8: Correlation plot comparing velocity of each pitch to the logarithm to base 10 of the normalized maximum EMG amplitude in the athlete’s front side gluteus maximus during the pitch.
The weak correlation correlation between EMG amplitudes and velocity makes a good deal of sense. There is a chance that it is a product of electrode misplacement, because if the electrodes are not accurately placed along the belly of the muscle, the surface EMG sensor will not capture the entirety of the signal. That being said, this is most likely due to the fact that lead leg blocking is a compound movement that involves several extensors. This means that there is more than one muscle that extends the leg, including hip and knee extension.
With regards to mean values of amplitude and frequency, conclusions cannot be final with the data collected. Because of the way that the signal is represented as a single column of data for the whole session, to get the mean values for each pitch, there has to be an accurate window encapsulating each pitch or event in the signal to give an accurate representation of the pitch itself. In this case, a standard window was determined using video analysis of one pitcher, but that window did not fit all pitcher’s deliveries which resulted in the analysis of some amount of inactivity in addition to cutting out some of the wanted data for some pitchers.
Figure 9: Full-wave rectified and filtered EMG signal with the standard length pitch window placed around where the proposed pitch is, with respect to time, in the bullpen. This shows the window misplacement for each pitch in some subjects that leads to inaccurate averaging.
For the mean values to be accurate and usable, the window of analysis would need to be personalized for each subject so that each event is represented correctly to minimize the amount of inactivity captured and maximize the desired data. This would need to be done by either using a different standard definition of onset EMG signal with regards to when the amplitude spikes and resets, or by videoing each of the subject’s motions to get an accurate visual representation and timing.
Surface EMG as it stands, is a very useful tool for acute measurements and analysis, but is not a valid form of evaluation for the long term effects of muscle activation or outcomes of compound movements. For example, if an athlete does not activate their gluteal muscles during a squat as much as the athlete next to him, we cannot say that their squat is weaker than the next athlete because his quadriceps could pick up the slack and move an overall heavier weight. This is because there is a wide range in combinations of muscle contractions to execute the same compound movements, hence the name, Compound movement.
This study on pitcher’s activation of their front gluteus maximus shows to prove such a point, because even though there is a large variance between gluteal muscle activation between pitches, the subject’s intent and outcome are similar. Further, on pitches with a higher activation in the gluteus maximus, the quadriceps or hamstrings could have lower activations if it has a similar outcome to a neighboring pitch with different gluteal activation. We can not definitively say that this is true, because we did not have EMG sensors on the other extensors of the pitcher’s front leg, but assumptions can be made by using what we know from the gluteal activation and the outcome of the pitch.
Figure 10: Time domain EMG signal of an entire mound velocity workout with 3 sets of 5 maximum intent fastballs with four warm-ups and two MVIC’s.
Using the observed variance between repetitions, we can also begin to conclude that mechanics that are aimed at being repeatable, when it comes to individual muscle activity, aren’t. We would love to be able to break mechanics down in a way that can be repeated all the way down to the individual muscle contractions because this would allow for more efficient training and specialized strength. Although that would hypothetically allow for better training economy and would be optimal for training athletes, we have to accept that compound movements as complex as a pitcher’s delivery are more chaotic than uniform. This alone is a good reason to train chaos, and macroscopic movements rather than muscle specific, isolation exercises when training athletes.
As mentioned in discussion, the pitching motion is a very advanced movement. Eric Cressey, a writer and baseball performance coach, talks about in a blog about how even, “some of the best in the world struggle to consistently repeat their mechanics,”[6] resulting in significantly different outcomes. In this blog he cites the variance of velocity in even the most elite pitchers in the MLB. There are countless external factors when analyzing this phenomena, including but not limited to, shape and size of the mound, temperature outside and wind during the game, not to mention physical differences in an athlete’s body with respect to health and hormone levels. This goes to show that the pitching motion is highly difficult to repeat, even at the macroscopic level. From the data collected here, we see that the repeatability is even harder to achieve at the microscopic level, which needs to be taken into account while training and performing as an athlete.
In exercise and sports science, really in all of science, we hope to be able to use scientific findings or trends to apply it towards a grander scheme. In this case, we cannot use the data for any strong conclusions about gluteus maximus being correlated to velocity or lead leg blocking. What we can use it for, is to validate the idea that there are many variations of muscle activity to achieve the same compound movement, and test it further by using multiple EMG sensors on the front leg. By doing this, we could test our hypothesis of quadriceps or hamstrings picking up the slack or lacking when gluteal activation is lower or higher, respectively. This would be a very interesting study, which could possibly tell us something about total extension EMG amplitude (gluteals, hamstrings, and quadriceps summed) in a pitcher’s front leg, and whether or not it is correlated to velocity.
What this also could lead us to, is attempting to break EMG into a more longitudinal setting by using it as a regular tracking/testing tool for athletes in the weight room as well as their throwing workouts. If we were able to regularly track athletes muscle activation during certain strength exercises and during their throwing exercises on the same muscle groups to compare the changes in outcome during their training, then we would be able to make some broader conclusions using EMG. This type of study, specifically, would be very beneficial for the exercise and sports science world, because we would potentially be able to correlate strength exercises to outcomes in sport rather than simply using movement comparisons to assume correlations.

Rethinking the Way a Hitter’s Brain Works: An EEG Case Study - Driveline Baseball,2017-07-26T13:34:14+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/07/rethinking-the-way-a-hitters-brain-works-an-eeg-case-study/,"Subtitle: Efficient Brain Activity with Practice and Enhanced Perception-Action Coupling
When it comes to the brain and hitting, we don’t really know much about what’s actually going on. If we’re able to understand the way a hitters brain works in a live situation, we can improve the way we train them. It could potentially even help pitchers in the way that they attack hitters. People have speculated as to how a hitters brain processes information while standing in the box, but how accurate are these claims? Much of pitch recognition and vision training for hitters is based around the idea that a hitter sees the pitch, assesses information about the pitch as it comes in, and then makes a deliberate decision as to whether or not to swing.
Train at Driveline
This process of information assessment and decision making calculation would have to happen at an absurdly fast rate, less than half a second. Until recently, researchers had not actually measured brain activity to validate this theory of hitting and pitch recognition. But, as wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) technology has improved, performance related studies have begun to investigate what the brain is actually doing in situations like this.
What is EEG?
Previous research has estimated that the human brain contains up to 100-billion neurons (Herulano-Houzel, 2009). These neurons have thousands of connections to other neurons in order to communicate and synchronize thoughts and activities. While individual neuron activity is far too small to detect, during many activities large numbers of neurons fire simultaneously. These large neuron firings can be detected as brain waves and can be measured on the surface of the head through an EEG. While an EEG signal is very similar to that of an electromyogram (EMG), which is used to measure the electrical activity of muscles, there are some distinct differences. The strength of electrical muscle activity is measured by the amplitude of an EMG signal; it is the summation of action potentials across muscle fibers.
The electrical signals that an EMG and EEG record can be differentiated by the frequency of each signal. The EMG, or muscle wave signal, is generally between 80-3000 Hz. For example, in our EMG studies at Driveline, we sample at 1000 Hz. Brain activity on the other hand is measured between a frequency of 0.5 Hz and 30 Hz. This activity is often differentiated into four-significant brainwave frequency bands: Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta. (Emotiv, Deuschl & Eisen, 1999):
30 modules teaching you everything we know about hitting and hitting mechanics.
While many scientists study how the brain works, there is limited research within the field of neuroscience and baseball. One group of researchers has attached EEG devices to hitters and monitored their brain activity while having them watch videos of pitches on a computer screen. This same group of researchers created a Go/No-Go task in which hitters watched videos of baseball pitches being thrown and were told to click a button on the computer if the pitch was a fastball (“Go” situation) and refrain from pressing any buttons if the trajectory of the pitch appeared to be a slider or a curveball (“No-Go” situation). This study compared the EEG results of collegiate Division I baseball and non-baseball players. The main highlights included the following (Muraskin, Sherwin, & Sajda, 2015):
So what do those results mean? Basically, experienced baseball players were found to actually have decreased activity during the Go/No-Go pitch recognition task in certain brain areas—specifically the frontal cortex, a part of the brain that is primarily in charge of deliberate decision-making. In the half a second that it takes for a pitch to travel to home plate, there is not enough time for a hitter to go through a deliberate decision-making process on whether or not to swing. Intuitively, this makes sense. Earlier, it was mentioned that increased activity in the beta-wave frequency band was an indication of inefficient brain activity. This would explain why more-experienced hitters have less frontal lobe activity and use enhanced perception-action coupling instead when it comes to pitch recognition and swing-decision making.
Perception-action coupling argues that perception and action processes are functionally intertwined. Perceptions of the environment are not that you necessarily understand the sensory information; rather, you perceive in the awareness of “affordances.” Affordances are the perceivable opportunities for action in the world.
So, how can this apply to hitting and why is it important? It is believed that the brain assesses and understands the information about the pitch coming in (spin, velocity, and trajectory), makes a deliberate decision whether to proceed with the swing, and then decides upon a location to place the bat all while the pitch is on its way to the plate. While the human brain has the capability to work incredibly fast, it can’t quite work that fast. The perception-action coupling theory when applied to hitting argues that information is not necessarily “understood”; rather, it is detected (the hitter sees the baseball pitch coming in), and then affordances are perceived (your opportunities for mechanical action, swing/no-swing). The information is not really ever understood, and there is no deliberate decision to swing. Much like a computer program algorithm, the visual stimuli are perceived and a physical action output is generated based on that environmental perception.
In the previously mentioned study on EEG and pitch recognition, their research supported the idea that enhanced perception-action coupling is an indication of baseball expertise. At Driveline, we have our own wearable EEG device called the Emotiv EPOC+. It is a 14-channel wireless EEG headset that can provide access to high-quality EEG data in a live setting in comparison to other wired EEG headsets that can only be used in a lab. It has previously been validated with other EEG systems to provide research quality EEG data (Badcock, et al., 2015). For our first pilot study with the EPOC+, we wanted to see if we could replicate similar EEG results in a Go/No-Go task when comparing “experts” and “novices.”
For this, we used our Senaptec Sensory Station and asked participants to go through a simple Go/No-Go visual training task for 30 seconds on a difficulty setting of 3. In this task, the goal is to touch the green dots that appear on the screen in random locations as quickly as possible while avoiding touching the red dots that randomly appear. We were basically trying to recreate the previously mentioned study with our own EEG device to see if it would be viable in a live baseball setting.
We tested multiple subjects and classified them as either a novice (little to no prior experience with using the Senaptec visual trainer) or expert (extensive experience with using the Senaptec visual trainer).
Our main findings were that experts appeared to have less beta-wave brain activity during this Go/No-Go task in comparison with the novices. In the images below, you can see example screen captures from the beta-wave frequency activity of two subjects.
In the case of the novices, we found that throughout their initial trials, it appeared that beta-wave activity slightly diminished throughout the duration of the test, which suggests that they became more efficient as the test continued and allows us to make an argument that they were not only making less deliberate decisions during the task but also that perception-action coupling may have begun to kick in.
We asked a few subjects to actually perform the Go/No-Go task a few more times and practice at it a bit, and then we retested their brain activity once more in another trial. There appeared to be another noticeable decrease in beta-wave brain activity when comparing the first trial and this last trial in these subjects.
While our first study with the Emotiv EPOC+ was qualitative in nature, we did collect data that supported findings from previous research and corresponded with the notion that Go/No-Go tasks, such as hitting or visual training games, are performed with enhanced perception-action coupling at experienced levels. However, there is a lack of information when it comes to how a hitter’s brain works when deciding whether or not to swing at certain pitches. Muraskin and Sherwin’s work on how the theory of perception-action coupling underlies hitting expertise could have a significant impact on the way that hitters are trained from a brain-activity perspective.
While further research is needed to validate this theory, if it is correct, and environmental perceptions are tied to the physical affordances of swinging a bat, it suggests that hitters can train this kind of perception-action coupling by seeing pitches in as close to as live a setting as possible. The best way to train this would be to experience live pitching as often as possible in a game-like situation. Muraskin and Sherwin have actually created a visual training software based on their research called the uHIT software, where players can train this perception-action coupling by watching pitches on a screen and pressing a button if they would swing. While this is a good alternative to seeing live pitching, further research is needed to improve on this type of training. One possible direction potentially could be the use of virtual reality to increase immersion during this kind of training.
With this perception-action coupling theory of hitting in mind, it is possible that different environmental perceptions are linked to different physical affordances. This means that there could potentially be different swing kinematics that occur when hitting off of a pitching machine versus actually hitting in a live situation. Earlier research has shown this with elite cricket players. Researchers found that there were significant differences “between initiation of backswing and front foot movement” when hitting off of a bowler machine and an actual live bowler (Renshaw, Oldham, Davids, & Golds, 2007). Understanding the differences that occur during these training constraints can help improve and develop better ways to train hitters with movement coupling in mind.
Is it possible that this theory of brain activity and hitting could actually help out pitchers as well? Of course! In the research article by Renshaw on kinematic changes in cricket player’s swings, they note that further research should examine the movement kinematics of batters who face bowlers with unorthodox bowling actions. It’s possible that this idea of movement coupling could help explain why pitchers with unorthodox pitching styles (sidearm, submarine, etc.) are sometimes effective.
As of late, Major League pitchers such as Marcus Stroman, Kenley Jansen, Johnny Cueto, etc. have started to switch up their timing and mechanics to the plate when pitching in order to mess with a hitter’s timing. This movement-coupling theory could explain why this style of pitching is becoming more effective; not only would it throw off a hitter’s timing, but it could have an effect on actual swing mechanics as well. While further research needs to be directed towards validating claims like that, the use of EEG devices like our EPOC+ has the potential to do just that.

Have been able to localize which specific brain regions are involved? Such as the STS or TPJ or others?
Thanks, Anthony for the good work and info. Off the top of my head, I know there was brain activity monitoring study of hitters a few years ago. In that study, there was a discernible activity prior to a swing (1/1000 sec.) much akin to the No/No Go task you efforted. The conclusion was as experience was gained the brain (decentralized) recognized certain patterns and acted accordingly – much like a file retrieval system. I think this is what Perry Husband has delved into with the idea of “hunting” rather than “reacting.” Narrowing the task of focus on what to look for, matching what to look for, and acting on what to look for. Good stuff.
This idea of hunting/searching for a certain pitch would be very interesting to look at. As technology improves, we’d like to be able to look at brain activity when it comes to pitch recognition and if there are specific differences with “looking” for a certain pitch or maybe a specific location and just reacting to it.
Where are the references for this article?  I spent several years monitoring reaction timing in the motor and somato-sensory cortices and VB thalamus in addition to EMGs. I’d like to read some of the background lit and raw and massaged data for these experiments.

Computed Muscle Control Analysis of Pitching Mechanics,2017-03-15T17:35:04+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/03/computed-muscle-control-analysis-pitching-mechanics/,"Continuing with our validation of a Forward Dynamic analysis of the pitching motion from last week (Part One), we had run through the initial stages of the simulation pipeline to have an accurately scaled model that is tracking the recorded kinematic motion and associated force plate kinetics closely. We are now ready to run a Computed Muscle Control algorithm in OpenSIM to calculate the specific muscle activations and forces which best reproduce the arm’s motion in order to determine how they affect the overall valgus torque imposed on the elbow.
CMC process running.. focusing the analysis on time from arm cocking to release, since this is where peak valgus moment occurs
(This article was written by Matthew Wagshol, Biomechanist in the R&D Department of Driveline Baseball.)
A standard muscle set is first used to determine a baseline for muscle behavior. Fourteen muscles and subcompartments were measured that cross the medial side of the elbow which can contribute a varus torque to counter the overall valgus moment at the elbow. These muscles were the Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (four compartments), Pronator Teres, Flexor Carpi Radialis, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Biceps (two compartments), Triceps (three compartments), Anconeous, and Brachialis.
The muscles are scaled along with the model and have been confirmed to represent the attributes of a 50th percentile male. These parameters include maximum isometric force, slack length, and stiffness (1).
The CMC process runs a weighted optimization that is set to focus on the muscles of the upper arm. Control constraints are also added to better align muscle firings with recorded EMG activity during pitching (2). The algorithm returns individual muscle forces during the motion which are then multiplied by their respective moment arms to calculate the Varus moments of each muscle compartment.
Individual muscle contributions for the Standard muscle set, grey line is time of peak valgus moment
Our results agreed with those of Dr. Buffi (3) and show that several muscles produce significant Varus moments during the pitching motion. The FDS has the largest moment which peaks slightly after the maximum valgus load, along with the FCR, FCU and PT. We also saw a peak TRI moment at the time of maximum valgus load, although in our model the maximum moment was lower than that seen in the original paper. We also saw a smaller effect from the BRA and ANC, which we believe aligns better with the small moment arms associated with these muscles. These differences can be attributed to minor alterations in model definitions, but the overall trends and peak muscle contributions confirm that our Forward Dynamic framework approach is consistent with the reviewed research.
While the previous muscle contributions results are a good baseline measure, elite baseball pitcher’s have muscles that are likely significantly stronger and more powerful than an average male. To explore this idea, an adapted muscle set is defined for athletes (3) which increased the maximum isometric strength by 29%, stiffness by 70%, and decreased activation times to 0.005s.
Total sum of varus muscle moment contributions of standard and adapted muscles with overall elbow valgus load
The adapted muscles have an increased total moment contribution over the pitching motion, but we have to take some additional steps in order to fully understand how the muscles affect the load felt by the UCL. We can accomplish this by defining a biomechanical force balance at the elbow with an equation that can be used to break down the different torque contributions.
Following Dr. Buffi’s dissertation (3), we state that the total measured valgus moment from the motion (Mvalgus) is equal to the sum of three varus moments. These varus moments are the total individual muscle contributions (Mmc), the osseous articulation moment from joint compression (Mart), and the remaining torque on the UCL (Mucl).
Therefore rearranging the equation we have:
We already know the total Valgus moment from the inverse dynamic analysis and we also know the sum of the individual muscle contribution moments from CMC. We now have to define and calculate Mart by looking at the joint compression force.
The osseous articulation moment, Mart can be defined as the joint compression force Fjc at the elbow multiplied by the corresponding moment arm dart.
Using the analysis tool in OpenSIM we are able to see the joint compression forces at the elbow over the motion. These forces are normalized to run along the longitudinal axis of the radius and be perpendicular to the varus–valgus DOF axis. We then multiply this resulting vector by dart which is defined to be the distance between the center of pressure of the osseous compression and the elbow joint center.
Adapted muscles produce a larger compression moment
With Mart calculated, we can complete our equation and determine the resulting load imposed upon the UCL.
Imposed UCL moment with full valgus load, standard, and adapted muscle sets
These results show that the traditional analysis of the imposed valgus load on the UCL is largely offset by muscle contributions and the joint compression force. Without muscles, the UCL would absorb all of the load, which is much higher than its carrying capacity (5). With a standard muscle set of an average male, the UCL load is greatly reduced to a peak of about 35 Nm, which is still enough torque to be responsible for injury. However, with adapted high performing muscles, the load on the UCL is reduced to 0, which means that the varus moments produced by the muscles and the corresponding joint compression force are completely countering the imposed valgus load.
These results are significant by providing a more detailed look at how individual muscles in a pitcher’s arm affect the distribution of the overall peak valgus torque from the motion. The simulation makes it clear that muscles in the arm provide a significant reduction in torque felt at the UCL, and that by strengthening these muscles to a higher level, the risk of injury can be diminished.
With this simulation framework validated, we are excited to use Forward Dynamic analysis as a tool to determine ways to improve muscle function as a pathway to reduce injury while still allowing for variation in a pitcher’s unique motion. We also intend to study the elite pitchers at Driveline Baseball to better our understanding of the adapted muscle set for athletes and fine-tune our guidelines and training protocols to ensure our pitcher’s are improving safely and effectively.

"Bullpens, Tracking Elbow Torque, and mStress - Driveline Baseball",2017-03-02T08:19:51+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/03/bullpens-tracking-elbow-torque-and-mstress/,"This article builds on the previous research that we did with the MotusTHROW Sleeve that looked at the relationship between elbow stress and velocity.
Here, we will look at how those relationships have changed (or if they did) under a larger sample and discuss why normalizing stress with velocity is so important.
(This article was written by Michael O’Connell, Research Assistant. Lightly edited for content by Kyle Boddy, Director of Research and Development.)
In our first go-round with the Motus Sleeve we originally had 17 athletes throw bullpens. It was later updated to 19, but one of the main points we saw was a smaller-than-expected relationship between velocity and stress, R^2 of .29.
Since those 19 bullpens, we’ve had 51 additional athletes throw high-effort bullpens for a total of 70 pitchers. We took the 6 fastest fastballs, for a total of 420 pitches, to use for our analysis. If a pitcher’s 6th pitch was tied by velocity, then we averaged those two or three pitches.
Here are the numbers from the original 19 pitchers.
Here are some updated numbers based on what we’ve found.
As always the numbers can be found here
Interestingly enough, the mean stress barely changed; it went up 0.8 Nm. The standard deviation of the stress decreased from 15.7 Nm to 12.8 Nm.
If we go back and compare the mStress measurements, we see that they are remarkably close as well.
The most interesting difference probably comes from the R^2 between the elbow-stress measurement and velocity. It decreased from 0.29 to 0.17.
So, there are really two ways you can look at the new Rˆ2 between stress and velocity.
First, you can believe that it’s a small difference, (since .17 of 1 is fairly small) and then you probably imagine that there are relatively small numbers of variables that account for velocity.
Put another way, if you believe that there are only, say, 5-8 main factors that could explain why pitchers throw hard, then, yes, velocity isn’t probably that much different than whatever those other variables are.
But, if there is a much larger number of variables that explain how a pitcher throws hard, say 15-20, then all of a sudden velocity seems much more important.
For example, Werner et al found 10 parameters related to pitching mechanics that accounted for 68% of the variance in ball velocity. Which would suggest a larger number of variables explain velocity.
We can expand our analysis to a multiple regression, including all of the metrics that Motus provides: Stress, Arm Speed, Arm Slot & Shoulder Rotation. After doing this, we end up with an R^2 of .23. Meaning the four metrics listed in the Motus app can explain 23% of the variance of fastball velocity.
So, adding these three variables only raises the R^2 0.06, from 0.17 to 0.23, which suggests that there are probably a larger number of variables that create velocity.
The variables that end up creating velocity are probably a combination of forces (such as elbow torque), mechanical differences (amount of horizontal abduction, elbow flexion, or knee flexion at stride foot contact), and minute-timing differences (such as decreased time to peak internal rotation). Some of which we can measure with the MotusTHROW, and others we need more equipment to measure.
Finding out which variables relate to faster pitching velocities is simply the first step. If (or when) all of those variables are discovered, then an entirely new process of discovery begins: how to safely make changes in those variables for athletes in order to increase velocity.
In future blog articles, we will further investigate the multiple factors related to velocity that are similar to the studies mentioned above.
mStress = (Stress / Velocity) * 100
Normalizing velocity with elbow stress is going to make it much easier to compare pitchers across the spectrum to one another. mStress is the metric that we introduced in our offspeed article and the average from our pitchers was listed in the graphic above.
mStress helps put the numbers into a better context across different ages, and it will allow for better comparisons for pitchers who throw similar velocities
This is especially important if velocity is going to be one of the factors related to injury, then we should adjust for it.
Here we compare pitchers who threw 95+ with pitchers who threw 86-88.
Now, we can more clearly see that every pitcher is not experiencing the same stress. Although some of the differences may seem small, they become more clear when comparing their mStress.
Training consideration could be made based off of those numbers, but first further investigation would be needed to see what created these difference in the first place. Maybe some players have increased stress for mechanical, strength, or mobility reasons.
While being able to create and know a player’s mStress doesn’t give us answers, it allows us to ask much better questions and hopefully come closer to keeping players healthy.
As we’ve covered previously, this will also be very important when discussing offspeed pitches as well. Much of the peer-reviewed research has suggested that pitches, such as curveballs, are lower stress than fastballs. We’ve also found this to be the case in our own research.
But when stress becomes normalized for velocity, then the relationships flip. The curveball becomes much more stressful.
Looking at these numbers in a different context can adjust the meaning. The relationship we found with the curveball may be part of the reason for the why peer-reviewed research suggesting curveballs are less stressful while anecdotally athletes and parents find them more stressful or dangerous.
There are a few caveats we have with using peak-stress measurements that we have mentioned before.
That being said, with the growing popularity of the Motus Sleeve and baseball tech, it’s still useful. The important part is that knowing the caveats will give you a better understanding of what you do and don’t know.
If you are going to use the mTHROW during bullpens, then you have the ability to track changes that occur during that pen. Over the long term, using the Motus Sleeve gives you the ability to track an athlete’s workload.
Or if you are a coach with a few sensors and many pitchers, there is no reason why you can’t have athletes “check in” by wearing the sensor every few bullpens. A coach can then keep track if there are any small or big changes between bullpens.
There are multiple ways that you can use this technology to keep track of athletes’ workloads and any possible changes that are occurring.
Plus, it gives a general marker that is much better than having no data at all.
We’ve published other articles summarizing our research, check them out here!
We see that velocity does not always translate to higher stress on fastballs. But I am curious, has any research been done to determine stress levels of a cut fastball compared to a normal 4seam fastball or even compared to a curveball?
We haven’t looked into a cut fastball, yet. But we have looked into curveballs, sliders, and changeups.
https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2017/02/fastballs-offspeed-pitches-comparative-relative-elbow-stress/
So in the study, pitcher 39 has a much higher stress level than pitcher 31. But because we cannot determine how that stress is “spread” over the different muscles, we cannot use that as an accurate injury predictor, correct? If that’s the case, what value does the Motus Sleeve have in terms of giving stress numbers?
That is correct. The literature on elbow stress and it’s relation to injury is currently only snapshots. One day of measurements.
The Motus sleeve can be used over time to see how (or if) stress numbers change and how those changes may or may not relate to injury
[…] we also wanted to see what would happen if we took velocity into account—mStress but for offspeed pitches. So we took the torque numbers and normalized them for their velocity to […]
If there is low correlation of stress and velocity I am not sure how  dividing the Motus stress  by velocity (Mstress) mathematically improves the correlation to draw better conclusion on crve ball, fast ball etc.

Weighted Baseball Research and the Data Supporting Their Use - Driveline Baseball,2016-12-15T23:50:26+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/12/weighted-baseball-research-data-supporting-their-use/,"With the recent release of ASMI’s Biomechanical Analysis of Weighted-Ball Exercises for Baseball Pitchers we decided that it was appropriate to discuss its findings in a more in depth review.
The first part of this article is going to look at the details of the ASMI study itself. Our commentary on the findings in regards to training can be found below in the ‘Response’ section.
For the scope of this article we are only going to discuss the findings of pitching weighted baseballs off the mound and the crow hop throws, otherwise known as running throws or pulldowns.
Holds were included in this study and we did use them previously in our program but we have not used them since 2012. If you are interested why you can read more here, here, here, or here (video). The short answer: We found wrist weight exercises first used by Dr. Mike Marshall, and traditional small medicine ball rebounder exercises to be much more effective.
If you go back far enough we didn’t think weighted balls ‘worked’ either; through experimentation we found out that they were effective training tools at developing velocity.
The exact mechanism for how they increase velocity is unknown. But Soviet Sports Science research on over/underweight implements provides the hypothesis that they can be seen as a form of ‘speed-strength’ or ‘power’ training for the arm.
Besides this new ASMI study we have 6 weighted balls studies referenced in our pitching research review, we also have a deeper look at long term weighted ball studies, and uncommon points from weighted ball research. We encourage everyone who is interested to find them and read them in full.
Coop DeRenne did much of the weighted baseball research previously and his paper Effects of Baseball Weighted Implement Training: A Brief Review provides us with this lovely summary chart.
So weighted baseballs, both under and overweight, have been shown to increase velocity. What wasn’t understood was how stressful weighted balls were in comparison to a regulation 5 oz baseball.
Update December 2017: We looked into the elbow stress of heavier overload Plyo Ball ® throws, both at high and low intent, with the Motus sleeve. You can find those results here.
ASMI wanted to test out how stressful weighted balls were when throwing them off the mound and during crow hop throws. So they took 25 pitchers (18 high school and 7 collegiate pitchers) who had previous experience with weighted ball throwing program and had them throw weighted baseballs weighing between 4-7 oz. They didn’t describe what experience they had but they had some familiarity with weighted balls.
The authors hypothesis was that “ball and arm velocities would be greater with lighter balls and joint kinetics would be greater with heavier balls.”
In other words, the 4 oz ball would be thrown at a higher velocity and the arm would move faster, throwing the 6 and 7 oz would result in higher stresses on the arm.
We use to believe that underload balls were less stressful, after years of internal data we now believe they have a higher peak stress and are more stressful when compared to a 5 oz ball. We have internally believed that overload balls are less stressful but that belief has not been echoed in the baseball community.
The Methods
The researchers took 3 trials of 10 difference exercises (pitching 4-7 oz balls off a mound, crow hop throws with 4-7 oz balls and flat ground holds with 14 and 32 oz balls). Each player was allowed to use whichever crow hop technique they preferred.
NOTE: The researcher’s often referred to the flat-ground crow hop throws as “flat ground throws.” For the sake of this article I will be referring to those throws as crow hop throws to not get them confused with flat ground pitching, which was not included in this study. We use Pulldowns in our training and I will reference crow hop throws / pulldowns later interchangeably.
16 position, 5 velocity and 5 kinetics values were measured for a total of 26 biomechanical parameters computed per each trial. They were measured by using 38 reflexive markers which were tracked by 12 cameras sampling at 240 Hz.
Each pitcher was able to throw as many warm up pitchers as they felt were necessary. All participants were told to perform each exercise at maximal effort and the order of the exercises and ball weight was randomized for each participant.
Quick aside to take a moment to realize how much work this was. 3 trials x 10 exercises = 30 recordings per person x 25 people = 750 times those 26 biomechanical parameters needed to be computed. Plus those markers can sometimes fall off when collecting data! The point is: This was an impressive amount of data to collect and crunch.
The Results
In general as ball mass increased, elbow and shoulder joint torques and forces decreased for both mound and crow hop throws.
As ball mass increased  angular velocities of pelvis, upper trunk, shoulder and elbow decreased for both mound and crow hop throws. The exception was the 4 oz ball, which was not significantly different than a 5 oz ball.
The data contradicts the authors’ hypothesis that joint stresses would increase with ball weight.
[expand title=”What’s a N-m (Newton-metre) again?”]
Newton metre (N-m) is a unit of torque. Torque is a moment of force that rotates an object, torque can also be thought of as a  measure of how much force is acting on an object that causes rotation. So the Newton-metre is a number that gives us the stress on a joint as it is rotating [/expand]
Weighted balls off the Mound
The 6 and 7 oz balls were less stressful than a 5 oz ball for both elbow and shoulder stress, suggesting that as ball weight increases, arm stress decreases. The exception to this was the 4 oz ball, which was also found to be less stressful than a baseball in the elbow and shoulder off the mound.
The highest velocity was the 4 oz ball and with each increase in weight velocities decreased.
Looking at mechanical differences just between 4 – 7 oz balls off the mound. Few statistical differences were found between positions when comparing the 4 and 7 oz throws.
“Although there were some statistical differences in body positions when pitching balls of varying mass, the magnitudes of these differences were small (about 1°) and probably of little clinical relevance. Thus, it appears that pitchers can train with their normal mechanics when pitching 4- to 7-oz baseballs from a mound.”
The differences in mechanics when pitching off a mound with weighted balls were irrelevant.
“pitching baseballs that are slightly underweight or overweight (4-7 oz) produces variations in arm kinetics, variations in angular velocities, and relatively small changes in body positions; therefore, these exercises may be reasonable for training pitchers.”
In short, when comparing the different ball weights off the mound there were slight differences in kinematics but those DID NOT come with a noticeable difference in kinetics (joint forces/stress).
Weighted balls for crow hop throws
The elbow stress of crow hop throws with a 4 and 5 oz ball were identical (91.7 Nm). As ball weight increased to 6 and 7 oz, elbow stress decreased. Shoulder stress was highest in the 4 oz and decreased as ball weight increased.
The highest velocity crow hop throw was with the 5 oz ball. 4, 6, and 7 oz throws were all thrown at slower velocities than the 5 oz.
Comparing crow hop throws to mound
“As flat-ground throws produce increased shoulder internal rotation velocity and elbow varus torque, these exercises may be beneficial but may also be stressful and risky”
When compared to pitching off a mound, the crow hop throws produced greater elbow and shoulder stress and less elbow flexion torque, most likely because of the added running start.
When comparing balls of the same weight, crow hop throws were anywhere from 1.5-3 N-m more stressful on the elbow on average. The crow hop throws were 1.4-3.2 Nm more stressful on the shoulder on average. This supports our own hypothesis that crow hop throws are either equal to or more stressful than pitching a 5 oz off the mound.
Even though the crow hop throws were more stressful the authors also said:
“differences in elbow and shoulder kinetic values between flat-ground throws with a 5 oz ball and standard pitching were minimal and statistically nonsignificant”
This suggests that max effort throws off the mound with a 5 oz ball are similar in stress to crow hop throws – even when at different velocities.
There were other kinematic differences between pitching from the mound and the crow hop throws – seen specifically in arm, trunk and leg positions at front foot contact and trunk and leg positions at ball release.
Is this a big or small difference? You decide
The numbers from studies like this are fantastic but we can’t forget that we can sometime lose sight of the individual athlete when dealing with averages such as this.
It is likely that some athletes in this study experienced significantly higher stress during the crow hop throws while others might have experienced less stress during the crow hop throws. There also could have been bigger individual differences between balls themselves that we do not know of. At Driveline one factor we consider when doing weighted baseball programming for athletes is to examine weighted ball velocity spreads weekly (comparing velocities of each weighted ball thrown) and we’ll make training adjustments based off those variations. Clearly there are other factors (overall strength, ROM issues, mobility issues, fatigue, etc) as well.
[bctt tweet=”Looking at velocity changes and monitoring athlete response is the key to using weighted balls.”]
Coaches must be adaptable to how their individual athletes are responding to a weighted ball program.
Shouldn’t baseballs that are thrown harder automatically cause more stress on the elbow?
The crow hop 5 oz throws were 7.8 MPH faster but only 1.5 Nm more stressful on the elbow and 1.4 Nm more stressful on the shoulder
Remember the authors found the differences in stress levels with the 5 oz throws as “minimal and statistically nonsignificant”, yet the velocity difference was quite large at 7.8 MPH.
This speaks more to the fact that we don’t yet fully understand the relationship between velocity and arm stress because there are so many variables to account for – also remember that there is no solved set of mechanics and training protocols that automatically cause velocity increases. The adaptation is different for each individual.
This would suggest that even though crow hop throws can be thrown at much higher velocities, the stress may not linearly increase as velocity increases.
[bctt tweet=”Elbow stress in pitching may not linearly increase as pitching velocity increases.”]
The difference between the 5 oz mound velocity and 5 oz crow hop velocity (7.8 MPH) is very large. This last summer we found the average difference to be 5.35, with a sample of 73 pitchers. Our closest comparison to this study is the 9 athletes we had throw 100+ MPH crow hop throws who had an average mound velocity of 92.5. Every other velocity bracket in our summer training group had a much smaller difference.
The spread (or difference between the 4 – 7 oz throws) was also much larger than what we normally see in gym for crow hop throws. The differences between ball weight in our gym for crow hop throws are much closer to the differences in velocity that were found off the mound – 3 MPH.
The velocities of both the mound and crow hop throws are also not what we would consider elite level velocities. This can partially be explained by the sample size with more high school athletes (18) than college (7). Therefore there may be differences in these findings if it was replicated with pitchers who throw 90+ off the mound.
Introducing variation in training is a common theme in motor learning, talked about in Frans Bosch’s book Strength Training and Coordination: An Integrative Approach
“…learning a movement does not mean learning how to perform it in an ideal manner which is fragile and only usable in a single incidental environment, but how to apply numerous variations on a theme in order to create a movement plan that can withstand a variety of environmental perturbations.”
Remember the data this study shows suggests that “pitching slightly underweight and overweight baseballs produces variations in kinematics without increased arm kinetics (joint stress), these exercises seem reasonable for training pitchers.”
If you are looking to introduce variability in order to increase your kinesthetic awareness and proprioception pitching weighted balls off a mound may be a great training stimulus for that.
One of the more natural thoughts after this is we may be able to look to weighted balls off the mound not only as a trainer of velocity but also a trainer of command.
The researchers found statistically significant differences (p<0.05) among ball weights between both pelvis angular velocity and upper trunk angular velocity.
Lets look closer as some of the quotes earlier, edited for emphasis.
“Pitching baseballs that are slightly underweight or overwieght (4-7 oz) produces…variations in angular velocities, and relatively small changes in body positions…some statistical differences in body positions when pitching balls of varying mass, the magnitudes of these differences were small (about 1º) and probably of little clinical relevance. Thus, it appears that pitchers can train with their normal mechanics when pitching 4- to 7-oz baseballs from a mound.”
Suggesting the mechanics of the pitchers were nearly the same but the velocities that the body moved at to reach those positions were different with the overload balls.
These findings run counter to the claim that weighted balls only train the arm.
It give credence to the idea that even small changes in weight (such as 1 oz) make the whole body slightly change how it tries to complete the task of throwing a ball to a target.
We hope that this relationship is investigated further in the further to see if those angular velocities continue downward as ball weight increased above 7 oz.
There was no statistical difference in elbow stress between the 4 and 5 oz baseballs and the 4 oz crow hop throws averaged 4.3 MPH slower than 5 oz throws.
The most likely reasons for this were every participant threw the weighted balls in a random order and the athletes training history. Although these athletes did have previous experience with weighted balls we do not know how long they used them or what program. We’ve seen in our program that first-time users of underload implements have much smaller velocity differences between a 4 and 5 oz ball.
Below are the weighted ball pulldown spreads from 61 of our college summer athletes. You can see that the baseline spread between the 4 and 5 oz balls is 1.75 MPH. 14 of these 61 pitchers (23%) threw the 4 oz ball slower than the 5 oz ball in their baseline testing.
You can find the full numbers here under the ‘baseline’ columns.
Note: The peak velocities are not perfectly weighted. Some threw more pulldowns than others and the peak of each ball can happen at different weeks. But the data itself is interesting to look at.
This completely contradicts the claim that underload balls “artificially accelerate” the arm. The reality is the body takes time to learn how to move the kinetic chain in a more efficient way resulting in a faster arm and higher velocities. It often takes time for an athlete to learn to move more efficiently and throw underload balls faster.
It is generally understood that underloads balls are more stressful because they can be thrown at higher velocities making then more stressful, which is true. Often overlooked is the training value and stress that underload balls bring to a pitchers decelerators. The arm can be moving at faster speeds with a 4-oz ball but you have the same amount of time to decelerate as you would with a 5 oz ball.
So a benefit to including underload training to a throwing program would be training at increased arm speed and training arm deceleration, making your body more efficient at absorbing higher forces.
Here is what the authors of this paper had to say in regards to finding the stress of overload balls to be less than a baseball:
“The presumption that exercises with heavier balls demand greater torques and force about the elbow and shoulder was in general not supported by the current limited study.”
“Based on Newton’s second law, the force required to move a ball is equal to the mass of the ball multiplied by its acceleration. Although the heavier balls have more mass the decreased force and torques imply that these exercises had less arm acceleration.”
Force = Mass • Acceleration
So even though the mass of the ball increase, it reduced the arms acceleration in a way that resulted in lower stress numbers.
Force on the elbow = Mass (7oz) • Acceleration (?)
Our hypothesis on weighted ball stress has been that throwing overload balls is less stressful than throwing a regulation baseball. This is also why both our Plyo Ball ® and weighted balls contain more overload balls than underload.
Although this study only went up to a 7 oz ball, we still believe that overload balls are less stressful than throwing a regular baseball. 7 oz is the heaviest weighted ball we use in pulldowns and it had the lowest elbow stress when compared to the 6-4 oz from both the mound and crow hop throws.
Dr. Fleisig talked further about these findings here.
—
Even though this study suggests that 6 and 7 oz balls are less stressful than a baseball this will most likely be the new critique of overload balls:
Even though overload balls have ‘less’ peak stress aren’t they actually more stressful because your arm moves slower so the stress is longer and different and therefore worse?
In other words, if it takes the arm longer to travel from max external rotation to ball release then wouldn’t that mean that total stress increased over that time?
It’s hard to say conclusively yes or no because it depends on how you want to measure ‘total stress’.
What we would need to know what the stress is at any given point throughout the pitching motion. During arm lay back into external rotation, at maximum external rotation (often but not always the peak stress), and then the stress as the ball is accelerating at ball release. Measuring elbow stress in milliseconds – which would be incredibly difficult.
An often overlooked point to this argument is that it isn’t the arm velocity but the arm acceleration that we would need to know. Once max external rotation is reached the arm is accelerating until it starts to decelerate; it doesn’t maintain a constant velocity.
Acceleration = Change in Velocity / Time
In order to know the acceleration we need to know the change in velocity during a specific period of time. We could calculate an average acceleration if we knew the time from max external rotation to ball release.
This would require extremely high-speed cameras perfectly synchronized. It’s possible that the cameras being used on a regular basis are insufficient for this purpose given the amount of variance between each frame of a video considering how fast the arm moves in the pitching delivery.
This is a pretty hard claim to conclusively prove; it would involve a lot of math, agreement of when to start measuring stress, and some serious high frequency cameras to be able to calculate the load during the acceleration.
Yes. Our Plyo Ball ® work is primarily meant for submaximal throwing and for constraint training, as well as general arm care. They’re not meant for throwing as hard as possible with zero mechanical intent to change.
When the mass of the ball is increased, the acceleration is much lower, plus the majority of the Plyo Ball ® throws are for mechanical work done at submaximal intent.
Secondly there is evidence that partial-effort pitching (60-80% of max effort) is significantly less stressful when compared to max intent pitching; there is no reason this can’t be applied to Plyo Ball ® as well.
Why still do running throws if they are more stressful?
The researchers had these thoughts on the crow hop throws:
“As flat-ground (crow hop) throws produced increased shoulder internal rotation velocity and elbow varus torque, these exercises may be beneficial but may also be stressful and risky.”
Again, our hypothesis before this study was that running throws equaled or surpassed the stress levels seen in a game, which is why they make a good training stimulus.
What we really want to do is stay away from long periods of submaximal stress and expect velocity improvements – which unfortunately is what a lot of the current physical therapist-led “throwing experts” are prescribing. Training pitchers for long periods of time at submaximal stress (offseason) and then putting them into situations where they may exceed previous maximal stress (in games) makes zero sense and is a good way to create serious injury potential.
Our pulldown (crow hop) throws are a programmed way – in the offseason – for athletes to push their stress levels at/above levels they would see in a game.
Crow hop throws with weighted balls are simply a tool to encourage velocity development through the stress response cycle, utilizing supercompensation and the body’s adaptation to training stimulus.
Crow hop/pulldowns are a programmed stress on the body in order to encourage positive adaptation (velocity development) over a long period of time.
Training stimulus: weighted ball pulldowns
Fatigue: from weighted ball training
Recovery: period between high-output training sessions
Supercompensation: faster velocities (Hopefully!)
That is why programming is so important. We want to stay away from high chronic training loads (overtraining) and low chronic training loads (undertraining) – otherwise we run the risk of what Tim Gabbett calls a training load error. A training load error can be seen as a mismanagement of stressors placed on the body, throwing off the Acute : Chronic load ratio.
If stress is chronically too low and then has a huge spike, we may be undertraining for what we want to do: Pitch at high intent levels to get professional hitters out! If the stress is chronically high and not properly managed, then we may be overtraining.
Unfortunately at this current time we lack a lot of ability to track training and pitching loads long term since real-time biomechanical feedback and wearable units are not yet that popular (or even allowed) in professional baseball. Pitch counts and pitch usage can bridge some of that gap for now, but technological embrace by MLB will be required to make meaningful progress in this area.
Pulldowns are ONLY meant for velocity development in the offseason and in order to do them you must be following an individualized and prescribed throwing schedule. We would never recommend doing pulldowns in season or doing them outside of a scheduled throwing program.
We have jokingly pointed out on Twitter that in a very quick time we have gone from:
Needless to say, this has been a surprising change in such a short period of time and that comes with both good and bad things to look forward to. There are going to be more studies on weighted balls with different methods and various conclusions in the future and that’s what is supposed to happen. Baseball training will change not only off of what future peer-reviewed research suggests but also off of experimentation by coaches and facilities, preferably with rigid data collection. Of those two the experimentation and tracking of results is probably the most important, since most people aren’t all that interested in reading published studies on baseball science.
The future of training is the ability to use peer-reviewed research to back your training, lead solid experimentation groups, and being data-driven. This is the difference between “this study said X and it applies to everyone” and the need for smart trial-and-error based experimentation using peer-reviewed research as inspiration!
In the end what does this new study prove? Nothing, no study proves anything.
A better question is: What does is suggest or what does it support?
[bctt tweet=”Therefore these (weighted baseball) exercises may be reasonable for training pitchers. -ASMI”]
ASMI’s study gives evidence that weighted balls aren’t inherently “significantly more dangerous” and that, if programmed correctly, they can be a benefit to a pitchers training. This study is particularly exciting to us because we get to replicate it, and indeed we are already on our way! We have been collecting Motus mTHROW data, high-speed video using our Edgertronic cameras, and kinematic data in our lab on pitchers when they pulldown so we can compare it to their mound work.
We look forward to continuing our own research on our program using our biomechanics lab and Motus sleeve among other technology available to track and measure athlete results.
This post was written by Michael O’Connell, Research Assistant in the R&D Department.
I’ve never been against weighted ball use. I feel like they are fantastic from a health standpoint as well. My thing is with the running throws and transfer of training. It’s pretty clear by the ASMI study and you’re summer program data collection that there is a pretty significant gap between velocities of the mound and the run. Seeing as how stress is nearly the same regardless of run or pitch, do you think more time can be spent doing max effort weighted ball throws off the mound instead of running? Maybe to get a little better carryover of training. Or will running throws always create significant increase in pitch velo. My question is in regard to the actual difference in running and pitching. Not weighted balls. Just the movement itself.
Absolutely, it’s something we are working on right now. We’re testing out more weighted ball work on the mound this offseason as athletes move closer to needing to throw off the mound. We’ll make sure to let everyone know how it goes!

"Elbow Stress, PULSE, and Velocity - Driveline Baseball",2016-10-29T02:09:08+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/10/elbow-stress-pulse-velocity/,"When measuring elbow stress in biomechanic labs it is often peak stress that is being measured. This peak stress often occurs during what many researchers call the ‘arm cocking’ phase of the pitching motion. The arm cocking phase is found between front foot contact and max external rotation.
The stress that occurs during this time is called valgus stress, which in turn is going to cause an equal reaction of varus torque at the elbow. A great explanation can be found in Biomechanics of Baseball Pitching: Implications for Injury and Performance by Glenn Fleisig
“In the arm-cocked position, shortly before max external rotation, the arm is experiencing varus torque. In this position peak elbow varus torque is 99+-17 Nm. Which is the equivalent to holding roughly a 55lb weight in your hand at that instant.”
As Newton’s third law of physics explains, every action causes an opposite and equal reaction. So in an effort to stop your arm from externally rotating too far from valgus stress, an eccentric internal rotational (varus) torque is needed.
This torque is often the peak torque placed on the elbow. It’s up to the UCL and the surrounding musculature to support this load.
So at a basic level we understand that decelerating the arm in external rotation and initiating internal rotation (arm cocking, max external rotation to acceleration) is very stressful on the elbow.
We believe that the PULSEthrow sensor is an accurate measuring tool for total elbow stress. Significantly lowering the bar from biomechanics lab all the way to the field for athletes and coaches to collect valuable data.
Mike Reinold presented some interesting data at this year’s SaberSeminar stating that the newest PULSEthrow sensor has an intraclass correlation (ICC) value of 0.99 for valgus/varus torque vs. stress (newton-metres) and the American Sports Medicine Institute’s lab in Birmingham, AL. We have since confirmed those findings with Glenn Fleisig (head of ASMI biomechanics research). Therefore, we can be confident that the PULSEthrow sensor gives very close readings to the elbow torque values that ASMI publishes.
The PULSEthrow stress metric gives its measurement in newtons/metres. Newton/metre (Nm) is a unit measure of torque, which can be described as a twisting force that tends to cause rotation.
So now we know what the PULSEthrow app is measuring (stress in Newton Metres (Nm)) and that it is accurate when compared to a lab such as ASMI.
Knowing this we also need to understand there is a difference between total stress and specific stress. What the stress metric doesn’t tell us is whether this stress is occurring directly on the UCL or some combination of the UCL and the surrounding musculature.
As James Buffi has stated previously: “There are more than 10 muscles that cross the elbow, and when we only consider the total elbow load, we really have no way of calculating how any of these muscles are individually affecting the load on the UCL during a pitch.”
We can assume that the PULSEthrow stress metric is an accurate measure of total elbow stress but we don’t know how that stress is distributed throughout the muscles and ligaments in the elbow.
What do the other metrics mean?
At this point we don’t have enough biomechanics data to validate the other metrics. We hope we will be able to do so by spring but for now we will be looking at the stress measure.
We can look at peer reviewed research to find some context in the stress readings. Keep in mind all these numbers are snapshots, we don’t know how or if these numbers would change under different training circumstances.
Some of the differences between studies can be explained by the time in which the study was conducted, the technology available or used, and the sample of athletes. (Which is why we try to recreate as much research as possible!). But you see a range of 52-120 Nm as possible varus torques produced on the elbow, which seems to be a large range.
The PULSEthrow app offers a high effort range of their own, 52-67 Nm, which falls in line with the studies above and our the mean stress we found from our athletes of 62 Nm. Again what these numbers mean in a specific training context is still up for debate.
One study in particular did point out differences in stress levels between playing levels.
The researchers found that joint forces and torque increased with each level of competition, with some difference in kinematics between levels as well. This gives some context to stress levels you may see with the PULSEthrow with athletes of different ages.
(For reference of this article Kinematics in the above article refers to: max pelvis angular velocity, max upper torso angular velocity, max elbow flexion, max shoulder external rotation. Though not the most accurate definition Kinematics describes motion and can be thought of as actual measurements of mechanics or mechanical differences.)
So we have an idea of when peak stress on the elbow occurs and we have a tool that can  accurately measure the stress, but we don’t know exactly how that stress is distributed. Moreover we have some context as to how those numbers compare to biomechanical studies of athletes of different ages
We have had 17 pitchers so far throw bullpens in the facility, ranging from 6-19 pitches when they were wearing the PULSEthrow sleeve. The number of pitches differed because of different goals of the mound work (mound velo vs bullpen) and some athletes did not like the feel of the sleeve.
For the purpose of this article we are only looking at 4 & 2 seam fastballs. The data was collect as either mound velocity days for gap year athletes or baseline data collection for professional athletes. These pitchers threw less than 10 off-speed pitches in total those were removed from the analysis.
Update: The original article had 17 pitchers and has since been updated to 19 pitchers. The numbers below have been changed to reflect that change. The numbers below also only look at the 6 fastest pitches from each pitcher.
Looking at our own data with a Pearson correlation coefficient we ended up finding a fairly small relationship between the stress metric and pitch velocity (through 114 pitches): .29 Rˆ2. Which was quite a surprising finding.
We can even take out the clear outliers (88.6 MPH at 36 Nm stress and 84.45 MPH at 30 Nm stress.) and the relationship only moves up to .32 Rˆ2 which is still surprisingly low. Looking closer you can see that the measurements of each pitcher are highly individualized. We saw a range of stress levels among our 17 pitchers from 30 Nm to 90 Nm.
This contradicts a commonly believed hypothesis that when comparing pitchers across a population the ones who throw the hardest also experience the greatest stress. We are only looking at elbow stress, this may not hold up when looking at both elbow and shoulder stress. But this is a very interesting finding nonetheless!
Looking further at our data we found small correlations between both MPH/Arm Speed (.13 Rˆ2) and Stress/Arm Speed (.02 Rˆ2). Even though there was a high range of mean stress readings (30 Nm – 90 Nm) the mean between all pitches was 61 Nm with a standard deviation of 15.7 Nm. All of our data is open-sourced, you can find it here.
Our data off the mound ended up being similar to the findings of the following study:
Correlation of Shoulder and Elbow Kinetics with Ball Velocity in Collegiate Baseball Pitchers (Open Access)
“Simple linear regression revealed very small Rˆ2 values, indicating that very little of the variance in joint kinetics can be explained by ball velocity…the correlations between ball velocity and both elbow-valgus torque and shoulder external-rotation torque were not significant”
This would suggest that mechanics and the role of the elbow musculature would play a bigger role in stress levels than currently believed.
One of the other more interesting findings was how much variance pitchers can experience themselves just throwing fastballs. Some pitchers were consistently in the same stress range others would have one or two strong outliers. Seeing these variations in stress readings can lead us in a few possible directions.
First the PULSE may occasionally get a misread, though we believe this is unlikely. Second the sensor placement may move after a certain number of pitches, throwing off the readings because of a change in location of the sensor. Third there could be small mechanical differences that are causing changes in metrics.
We lean strongly towards the second or third hypothesis. If you are going to use the PULSEthrow make sure, for reliability purposes, to remind the pitcher to check on the sleeve a make sure that the sensor is in the same position.
Update: Dr. Mike Sonne wrote a follow up blog post using our data. He found that removing the two pitchers who threw 6 pitches while only looking at the top 9 velocity throws from the original 15 pitchers the correlation between velocity and stress goes up to Rˆ2 0.32. Suggesting the relationship between stress and velocity is significant.
“In summary, pitch velocity shows a significant relationship with arm stress, using PULSE. If you throw harder, chances are, you will have higher levels of stress on your UCL. It is important to properly condition and be strong, so you can withstand these stresses. There are many other factors that go in to determining just how much stress is on the UCL, but these must be further studied by hard working groups like Driveline, and researchers in other facilities.”
At this time our numbers do not suggest a strong relationship between elbow stress and velocity but this conclusion contradicts other research, including some of our own.
These studies are not clear if the increase in stress is due to velocity increases or changes in kinematics. So the relationship between velocity and stress is still incomplete.
What we see so far is that the measurements that we are collecting do fall in line with some of the available research. So can we make the assumption that higher stress may be related to a higher injury rate? No because we still don’t know how the stress is distributed.
If you look at the last study listed in the earlier infographic comparing elbow varus torques you can see that they had a fairly interesting study comparing previously injured pitchers with a healthy control. 38 pitchers with no injury history compared to 39 who had UCL reconstruction in the last 4 years. There was no biomechanical or passive range of motion differences between the two groups and no significant difference in varus stress. In fact the mean varus stress of the two groups was the same, 99 Nm with the only differences coming in the standard deviation.
PULSE may enable us to collect enough data on athletes prospectively instead of retrospectively to reveal  differences between elbow stress levels.
At this point it is too early to tell what these numbers mean for training purposes. Especially considering there have been computer models that have found increasing muscle force can decrease the load on the UCL. If this were to occur while wearing a PULSE you would still see the stress metric, but have no idea if that number is keeping you healthy or risking injury.
It’s quite possible that you could strengthen the surrounding musculature have total stress increase but have stress specifically on the UCL decrease and have no idea. It’s also possible that stress being very low could be a good thing or an injury risk because that isn’t a high enough amount of force to protect itself over time.
At this time all of these are theoretical possibilities because we don’t yet understand how elbow load changes in response to specific throwing and training protocols.
Thinking about stress knowing there is a large unknown of the effects of strong or weak elbow musculature makes it clear that we can’t yet state what the ideal stress range is.
Best case scenario: keep collecting data under different training circumstances and see where it leads. This is what the PULSE enables us to do. You can wear the sleeve when you are pitching, throwing flat grounds, long tossing, using Plyo Ball ® and track progress over a period of time. We can then take this data, see how it changes under different training protocols and then get closer to understanding the true context of what it means. The PULSEthrow app also has options for weighted ball and long toss data collection. Growing the possibilities of trying different training protocols and their effects.
We know when peak stress on the elbow occurs. We have a tool that can accurately measure the stress and we have some context as to how those numbers compare to biomechanical studies. But we don’t exactly know how stress in either (PULSE or Lab) measurement is distributed between the UCL and surrounding musculature. Because of this the relationship between velocity and stress may not be a direct as previously believed because stress numbers can be altered by mechanics and muscle strength. This isn’t the time to make drastic decisions off of one session of readings. It’s the time to use this technology to track athletes as they progress over time.

Want to read more about the data-driven research we’ve got going on at our facility? Check out our research articles.
I haven’t been able to find any research that identifies which phase of the pitch accounts for UCL tearing. Is that known, or assumed? A tennis serve looks very similar to a pitch in terms of maximum external rotation, yet tennis players rarely (ever?) need TJS. The abstract linked below notes a varus torque of 67.6 Nm during a tennis serve, which is similar to Driveline’s pitcher readings. Does gripping the racket add more musculature support to the elbow? Is UCL tearing actually occurring in a later phase of the pitch?
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12801213
Right now it’s believed that peak Varus torque it often at Max External Rotation. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when/where a tear occurs but probably closest to the moment of peak stress.
Unsure how gripping a tennis racket would affect the musculature support, though some believe that’s why tennis players don’t have as many UCL issues. The exact moment a tear occurs at is a good question though!

Driveline Baseball Review - College Summer Training Results 2016 - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-31T04:31:27+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/college-summer-wrap/,"182 athletes trained in our facility this summer. To review the results, the average athlete’s mound velocity improved from 86.7 mph to 90.04 mph.
Yes, our college summer athletes averaged 90mph off the mound. Below is some more data we collected on their training.
Of those 182 athletes 150 of them were in the facility long enough for them to pulldown in the facility. The average peak pulldown of those 150 athletes was 92.46 MPH.
A critical finding this summer was seeing the longer athlete stayed the more their pulldowns improved.
We’ve had previous blog posts on frustrations with long term velocity gains. Here are some examples of non-linear velocity development with pulldown numbers from this summer.
We were able to get self reported spring velocities from 61 players who threw bullpens. They had an average mound improvement of 3.26 MPH when comparing spring velocity to post Driveline velocity.
We ended up finding a pretty high correlation between pulldown velocity and mound velocity. This includes pitchers who did not have a reported spring velocity.
Here’s what our summer data tells us about where pitchers were on the mound by looking at their pulldown numbers.
You can find the data from this summer here.
We are looking forward to expanding this data collection into the pro offseason!

Examining Stress Injuries In The Lower Back - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-28T02:15:00+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/examining-stress-injuries-lower-back/,"This is a guest post by Terry Phillips (DPT). Terry specializes in manual therapy, orthopedics, sports medicine, and post-surgical rehabilitation. Terry works full time at ATI physical therapy as well as helping out our guys part-time.
I’ve always loved the game of baseball, from when I was very young through my last year of play during my first couple years of college. I am fortunate to continue my passion for baseball through my profession as a Physical Therapist. Unfortunately, around this time of year, my schedule begins getting filled with many ball players with a wide array of injuries.  The most common, are injuries to their spine.  Spinal injury pain presents in many forms and what may surprise you most is the pain presents in other areas of the body more frequently than the back. This is important to understand because sometimes the true source of an athlete’s injury may not be very clear.
It is well-documented that repeated backwards bending and rotation of the spine are causes of lumbar stress injuries. As a result, higher incidences of stress injuries are reported in gymnasts, dancers, and divers (McNeely et al., 2003).  Knowing that, consider the number of times softball and baseball players throw and swing the bat throughout a game, multiplied by the number of games each season, and the countless rotations that occur during practice prepping for the games.  This ends up being thousands of rotations on the spine in just one season – that’s stressful for anyone’s spine, let alone a teenager who is still developing. The result of these repetitive motions is increased strain on the individual bones of the spine, which eventually, over time, could lead to a stress fracture, or a “pre” stress fracture, also known as a stress reaction.
Similar types of stresses placed on the low back across different sports
Our brain and spine work together to protect our body.  When an injury is sensed near our spine the muscles around it become weak and perform poorly (Hides et al., 1994). Those muscles are neurologically linked to other muscles that stabilize the spine (which make up the “core”).  When one muscle shuts down, the entire stabilizing system becomes inhibited (note: six-pack abs and the ability to hold a plank does not equal a strong core).  This is where signs and symptoms begin to present and can cause injury if not detected.
From a baseball or softball player’s perspective an inhibited core is only going to rob them of performance. Hitting and throwing are extremely fast motions, that require a lot of force production from the body. An injury to an athlete’s spine, will not allow them to generate the amount of power, or ability to move through the ranges of motion that are unique to the sport. An undiagnosed or improperly treated stress injury could potentially alter or prevent a player’s career.
There are several signs to look for (Looper et al., 2008), and the presence of any one of these signs does not necessarily mean there is a spinal injury.  The more signs that are present, the greater the concern and likelihood I will refer the athlete to a spine specialist. Here are the things I look for in the clinic: (Health pro tip – notes for healthcare professionals in somewhat technical terms)
Pain:  Pain in the short term can be a “normal” occurrence in any teen, athletes included. However, teens’ bodies are very resilient and have not had the years of wear and tear of an adult. When I see an athlete who has chronic pain in their back (has been present for longer than a month or two), my suspicion of a stress injury is immediately raised. It should be noted though that pain will not always be present and a lack of pain does not always rule out a spine injury.
Decreased Spine Motion: Lack of mobility in the low and mid-back is something that I will see fairly consistently with a stress injury.  Any motion could be limited by pain or muscle length whether it occur while bending forward, backward or side to side
(Health pro tip – check quadrants, or diagonals (bending back and to the right, forward and to the left etc.) as this puts the segments of the spine through maximum range of motion.)
Decreased Straight Leg Raise: When an injury is present to the spine, the casing around the sciatic nerve can tighten up for a multitude of reasons. This is the brain’s way of not allowing the sciatic nerve to stretch to what is perceived as a threatening range. This will commonly be diagnosed as tight hamstrings.
(Health pro tip – keep the ankle maximally dorsiflexed and passively move the leg toward the ceiling. A positive test is if the first bit of resistance (R1) the tester feels is less than 60 degrees.)
Decreased Hip range: In addition to spine and pelvis positioning, decreased hip mobility can be a protective response to an injury to the spine which I see often.
(Health pro tip – I look specifically at the FABER test, a normal test will have the athlete’s shin coming parallel to the table or ground, without their opposite hip coming off the table.)
Decreased Latissimus Dorsi (Lat) Length: When an injury is present to the lumbar spine, the fascial layer where the lats attach will tighten to provide stability to the spine. Tightness at one end of the muscle will make it more difficult to stretch at the other end, which happens to be close to the shoulder; decreasing overhead motion along with external rotation (“Lay back” for all the pitchers out there).
(Health pro tip – the athlete should be able to keep their elbows close together and their hands separated into 120 degrees of shoulder flexion with their low back flat.)
Weakness in the Lower Extremities: Over the years, I have found this to be most telling bit of information I receive during an exam. Muscle testing allows us to find if the athlete’s weakness is actual pure weakness or if it is a result of the spine not stabilizing to allow for full muscle recruitment. Weakness found during an exam can be taken as a chicken and the egg type situation. Is the weakness there because of injury, specifically to the spine? Or is the injury there because the athlete has always been weak? For a way to tease this out please refer to the video below:
While a good physical exam can go a long way in detecting an injury to the spine, the only way to fully confirm the presence or absence of spinal stress is through proper imaging. This is where there can commonly be discrepancies between what various medical professionals may find.  Research shows x-rays and MRI’s can often miss a positive finding. A stress fracture or stress reaction is much more likely to get picked up with a CT scan or a bone scan (Bono et al., 2004). Additionally, stress reactions are difficult to identify and frequently overlooked – unless looking specifically for it.  If you or your child is experiencing several of the symptoms have a discussion with your doctor (or ask your physical therapist too!) about what type of imaging they use in these instances and what their thoughts are on stress reactions.
Depending on the results of the imaging, the course of treatment can vary significantly. Treatment of a stress fracture or stress reaction is a large topic with many different theories and is too large for this blog post. In general, while the stress reaction/fracture is present, activity modification or even complete cessation of their sport will also likely be a necessity to reduce the amount of stress being placed on the spine and allow for healing to occur; this is a temporary loss for a lifetime of a difference.
Additionally, because the stabilizing muscles will not start functioning on their own, targeted exercises delivered in physical therapy is necessary to build up the strength of the athlete.  If not treated properly, the protective response could remain (Hides et al., 1996), the stabilizing muscles can continue to function improperly and athletes will have lingering flexibility and weakness issues. They could result in more consistent hip and leg injuries as a result of their ongoing weakness and inhibition. In all likelihood they will also eventually develop more consistent or chronic back pain.
Proper detection and treatment can significantly change the course of an athlete’s career. My hope is that  this has raised more awareness of what what is a fairly common injury and athletes will seek the proper help.

Is Long Toss with Weighted Baseballs Less Stressful on the Arm? - Driveline Baseball,2016-08-24T12:53:09+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/08/weighted-baseball-long-toss-less-stressful-on-arm/,"This article was written by Kyle Boddy, who is the head of the Research and Development department of Driveline Baseball. Kyle designed the study while Michael O’Connell helped collect the data.
This is the third of many research themed blog posts where we take a closer look at some of our in-house research. The objective is to share as much of the data as possible with you in order to encourage an earnest discussion amongst coaches on how to train healthier pitchers.
Weighted baseball and long toss use are popular in both amateur baseball and professional baseball organizations. Despite claims from coaches that weighted baseballs are not used in MLB, Driveline Baseball has served as consultants to multiple MLB organizations to help them roll out comprehensive weighted implement training programs. Furthermore, though many MLB teams employ a restrictive 90-120-150 foot throwing program, an increasingly larger number of MLB organizations participate in so-called “extreme” long toss as their de facto throwing program.
However, we’re here to take a look something beyond both of those programs: What if you long tossed with overload and underload weighted baseballs?
We selected six (6) amateur baseball players – four of them with college experience, two with high school experience. All were currently training to throw as part of either a pitching preparation program or a position player throwing program. We instructed the athletes to warm-up in the same manner athletes in our programs prepare for a bullpen or long toss, including soft tissue work, Jaeger Sports J-Band programs, dynamic mobility drills, Plyo Ball ® throwing patterning, and so forth. We had them throw regulation weight (5 oz) baseballs to tolerance until they were ready to start the data collection phase.
At this point we fitted the athlete with a MotusTHROW sensor (Motus Global) and form-fitting sleeve and had them make 1-3 test throws to ensure data was being accurately collected. We used the MotusTHROW sensor for this study because of its ease of use and quick results. At SaberSeminar 2016, Mike Reinold presented some interesting data from his ongoing weighted ball study, stating that the newest MotusTHROW sensor had intraclass correlation (ICC) values of 0.99 for valgus/varus torque vs. stress (newton-meters) between the American Sports Medicine Institute’s lab in Birmingham, AL and the MotusTHROW sensor itself. When I spoke to Dr. Glenn Fleisig (head of ASMI biomechanics research), he confirmed these values over the phone. Therefore, we can be pretty sure that the MotusTHROW sensor gives very close readings to the elbow torque values that ASMI publishes.
A few research articles worth looking into at this point:
The gist of the above studies (and others widely cited) is that it is generally accepted that reducing elbow torque while improving ball velocity through optimizing kinematic (mechanical) parameters is a good goal. In other words, equivalent ball velocity at lower torques is a very desirable thing per most published biomechanical research on the pitching delivery. Dr. James Buffi’s research goes into a bit more detail on why simple elbow torque is not sufficient enough to predict injury with any reasonable error band, and while it is the position of Driveline Baseball to agree with this approach, measuring elbow torque accurately using the MotusTHROW sensor may provide Driveline Baseball and other coaches another set of data to analyze in the future.
Each pitcher executed 20 high-arc long distance throws, simulated into the top of our throwing cage at about a 30-35 degree angle. Previous studies on long toss (Fleisig et al JOSPT 2011) may not have properly computed cosine angle error; to combat this, Driveline Baseball placed the radar gun (Stalker Sport 2, Plano, TX) directly in the line of the throwing vector to achieve the most accurate and precise results.
An example of cosine measurement error
Since our radar gun was elevated and placed directly in the “line of sight” of the baseball being thrown, no significant cosine angle error should be expected.
The grouping of the throws broke down as such:
PITCHER 4 IN OUR DATA THREW ONLY FOUR (4) REGULATION BASEBALLS IN THE THIRD PHASE. It is not expected this changed the values significantly at all.
This follows our standard regular-overload-regular-underload pattern that we’ve tested over the years.
For each throw, we recorded:
We then averaged the velocities and stresses and computed the differences.
Hypothesis: Going into the study, we expected the overload throws to have a lower amount of elbow torque with lower velocity, and the underload throws to have a higher amount of elbow torque with higher velocity, all compared to the baseline regulation baseball throws.
All six pitchers completed the study with no pain, soreness, or missed readings with the MotusTHROW or the Stalker Sport 2 radar gun. Their results in chart form:
Overload Phase
As expected, our Overload Phase had lower stresses recorded on the arm, and either reduced velocity or insignificantly higher velocities. What was surprising was the magnitude of the stress reduction with a 6 oz overload ball compared to a 5 oz regulation baseball!
Underload Phase
Completely counter-intuitively, the Underload Phase had very large reductions in stress at the elbow, while the velocity changes were about what we expected.
This finding was shocking. Given the ICCs and sensitivity of the MotusTHROW compared to ASMI’s lab equipment, while we can’t definitively say that overload/underload weighted ball long toss is SAFER on the arm, the data absolutely does not support that weighted baseball throwing is MORE stressful on the arm. Further research will have to be done on these modalities using both the MotusTHROW and other equipment.
Improvements to this study may include:
As always in these Primary Research articles, we’ve open sourced all of the data – please take a look at it and write your own articles based on the data!
OPEN SOURCE DATA FOR WEIGHTED BASEBALL LONG TOSS STUDY
That is pretty amazing!  The overload results are what we would have expected as well but the underload results are very interesting.  So my initial questions are:
Were the players throwing with max effort on the throws?
Was it a shuffle, pull down, crow hop?
While sitting here with our staff discussing it these were some initial questions.  Also, sometimes when throwing an underload or overload ball there are mentality changes with the player executing the throws.  Knowing they are throwing a heavier ball an athlete will sometimes prevent the arm from completely externally rotating.  They do this in order to compensate for the weight because they don’t trust the throw.  So, does it really decreases stress or is it because they aren’t throwing with the same effort/exact mechanical patterns they would use to throw a 5oz ball.    Were these guys really letting it all hang out to provide completely accurate results?
How is it possible that a higher weight AND a lower weight both reduce stress?
Based on previous studies it is our understanding that throwing off a mound increases elbow varus torque and stress placed on the arm.  If your results are accurate and throwing with overload and underload implements actually reduces stress placed on the elbow, wouldn’t it make sense to do more weighted ball work off of an actual mound.  Won’t that translate results to the mound faster?  Next study off of a mound por favor?  We have the Motus also.  I will do the same testing here but I’d love to compare results.  I have 2 coaches here that can still run it up to 92 but they are done so they could care less if they blow it out for the betterment of the community haha.  We actually discussed doing a long toss program with weighted balls last year but with lack of data didn’t want to compromise anyone.
It was near max-effort throws. They were indoors on an upwards angle so it’s tough to tell them to really air it out.
Shuffle/pull-down type throw with upwards angle.
Mentality could be a thing but velocities went up across the board especially for underload balls. So they were definitely giving it near-equivalent effort at the minimum.
Mound work is on the docket for sure!
Appreciate you letting us in on all this Kyle. Very helpful,
Very welcome – thanks for reading!
I second that on the thanks for sharing.  After I posted we discussed it more and realized that the output was the same due to the increased velocity readings with the lighter ball so effort must have been close to the same.
What are your initial thoughts on why there was a decrease in stress with both over and under?  Is it just that we are so conditioned to the 5oz ball that we get into the protection mode with overload and because underload is lighter there is just less stress because of lower weight?  I wonder what the results would be as you decreased the weight and at what weight would the stress levels spike.
Also, if you had a player with EXTREME external rotation resulting in poor acceleration what would your approach be?  Assume much has been done and there have been results but we need to be more outside the box.
Not sure about the theories. At this point I want to collect as much actionable data. In my opinion there are way too many untested theories out there, too many hours of pitching coaches talking about stuff they have zero proof of, and not enough people pulling together, collecting data, and answering the tough questions in an honest way. That’s what Driveline Baseball stands for now and I’m excited to continue to crank out tons of open data for everyone to take a look at and challenge everyone to pitch in as well!
[…] Update 8/25/2016: Since the publication of this article we have found a high intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.99 for valgus/varus torque vs. stress(newton-meters) measurement of the Motus.

Pitching Velocity and its Effect on UCL Stress Using the PULSE Sleeve - Driveline Baseball,2016-07-28T06:46:03+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/07/pitching-velocity-and-its-effect-on-ucl-stress-using-pulse/,"This is a guest post by Dr. Mike Sonne that was republished from his website. Dr. Sonne has a PhD in biomechanics from McMaster University in Hamilton, where he studied muscle fatigue and how it influences performance.
The dudes over at Driveline gave us scientists the best present we could ever hope for – data.
Up here in Toronto, you can’t go five minutes into a Blue Jays conversation without hearing about the dilemma the team faces regarding Aaron Sanchez. The young ace Sanchez, is without a doubt, the best pitcher on the team, and arguably one of the top five starting pitchers in the American League this season. Last year the Jays spent a ton of prospect capital to go out and get an ace in the trade market – this year, they’re talking about moving the Ace they already have into the bullpen.
I’m not convinced that this is going to work to reduce stress on Aaron’s arm. Will he throw fewer innings? For sure – but as I’ve tried to demonstrate – fatigue accumulation in the arm doesn’t necessarily depend on the number of innings you pitch, but more on the number of pitches you throw in an inning. Sanchez has been known to dial up his fastball to 100mph out of the bullpen, and this left me asking the question – despite limiting his innings, is Aaron Sanchez going to be exposing his arm to more stress by throwing out of the pen? Let’s look at the driveline data to see if we can figure this out.
In the Driveline study, five pitchers threw 20 pitches each. Some had Powerguard on, some didn’t – but for the sake of this study, I’m going to ignore that factor (they didn’t find there was a reduction in stress, anyway). First, I looked at the relationship between stress and the other variables that came out of the PULSEthrow Sensor. There was an R2 of 0.84 between pitch velocity and elbow stress – that means, 84% of the stress on the UCL can be accounted for by the velocity of the pitch. If someone throws harder – they’re going to have more elbow torque, and greater UCL stress. The rest of the variables – they get a bit hazier.
We found a different relationship between velocity and stress when looking at PULSE data off the mound
Arm speed has an inverse relationship with elbow torque. Greater arm speeds appear to have less UCL stress, but arm speed only accounts for 25.5% of the variance in UCL stress (an R2 of 0.25). Arm slot accounted for none of the variance in UCL stress (so no fancy graph for this one). Finally, shoulder rotation angle accounted for 34.8% of the variance in UCL Stress. I’m not entirely sure what “shoulder rotation angle” is defining here, so I’m just going to leave it for now. Essentially, with a greater shoulder rotation angle, there is greater UCL stress.
The idea that UCL injuries are more prevalent in higher velocity pitchers is not a new one (Keller et al., 2016). Researchers from the University of Michigan found that one of the most significant predictors for elbow injury was ball speed (Whiteside et al., 2016). However, how does a change in ball speed influence UCL stress?
I used the driveline data, and I rank ordered UCL stress, and Velocity. So – there is a 1 through 20 for Velocity and Stress – which I’ll refer to as individual velocity and individual stress. I then ran a Spearman’s correlation on these data.
There was an R2 of 0.17 – essentially stating that an internal increase of velocity is associated with 17% of the increase in UCL stress. As you can see in this graph, this is not the strongest of relationships. Does a pitcher ramping up and throwing harder, within his own capacities increase stress on the arm? Possibly, but I don’t think it’s that clear.
There are a lot of other factors that go into determining how stress may change between the role of a starter and a reliever. Particularly, relievers (and relievers in the proposed role that Sanchez will fill) will be coming in for high leverage situations. Working in such a stressful situation can change kinematics, as Bill Marras’ group found when exposing those who were lifting boxes to highly stressful work environments (Marras et al., 2000). When preventing injury, recovery is one of the most important aspects of health. Relief pitchers can perform on up to three consecutive days – and while pitching only 1 inning at a time (in most cases), they still need to perform warm up pitches. Their workload is definitely different than a starter’s, but I don’t think there is enough evidence out there to support that switching from a starting role to a reliever’s role is that much of a reduction in demands on the arm.
The Blue Jays hired a high performance team to help make scientific decisions when it comes to things like monitoring a pitcher’s workload. They have a really hard decision ahead of them, and the long term health of Aaron Sanchez depends on them making the right choices.

Can You Reduce Pitching Elbow Stress Using a Sleeve? - Driveline Baseball,2016-07-20T11:24:58+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/07/can-reduce-pitching-elbow-stress-using-sleeve/,"The majority of this article was written by Michael O’Connell, who is our first analyst in the Research and Development department of Driveline Baseball.

We can therefore suggest that the MotusTHROW sensor gives very close readings to the elbow torque values that ASMI publishes. You can read more about this finding here
In late 2015, the Bauerfeind EpiTrain Powerguard was released with several press releases accompanying the launch of the product. Part of the press release from their website states:
Working closely with Bauerfeind USA, [Dr. James Andrews] helped develop EpiTrain PowerGuard, the world’s first elbow support that helps prevent hyperextension for throwing athletes.
“The Bauerfeind EpiTrain PowerGuard brace was developed with my supervision to be a functional brace for a lot of different athletes,” Andrews said, noting that he envisions athletes in softball, football, javelin throwing and cheerleading also benefitting from the brace.
The EpiTrain PowerGuard features and individually adjustable Boa closure system that cushions the elbow to prevent hyperextension. The Bauerfeind Knit sleeve is extremely soft, comfortable and functional for wear during practice or games, and provides medically effective compression that aids proprioception and helps reduce pain and swelling.
“You can tighten [the Boa closure system dial above] the elbow and prevent extension, and the Bauerfeind Knit can help you control swelling that occurs around the elbow as well as prevention of hyperextension,” he said.
Driveline Baseball is extremely motivated to find and test out any equipment that can help with the rehabilitation of post-surgical pitching arms or to improve pitching mechanics through improved proprioception. There is mixed evidence regarding the effect of athletic sleeves around hinge joints and their effect on proprioception (¹, ², ³, ⁴). We could not find any published research data specific to the Bauerfeind EpiTrain Powerguard. As such, we decided to design a quick case study using new wearable technologies – we chose the mThrow Motus Sleeve to compare their “stress” metrics and other kinematics provided by their product.
The Bauerfeind Elbow Sleeve was created to reduce stress on the UCL by restricting the athlete’s ability to hyperextend their arm. It achieves this by tightening a string mechanism in the sleeve that sits in a V shape in the crook of the athlete’s elbow. When the sleeve is tightened, it reduces the amount of extension and/or hyperextension that an athlete can have in his arm. First, we tested the Bauerfeind elbow sleeve (anti-hyperextension) with the addition of the mThrow Motus sleeve. We sought to examine the stress measurement the mThrow sleeve provides to see if using the Bauerfeind sleeve simultaneously would reduce UCL stress or other kinematics without reducing velocity.
The tightening mechanism of the Bauerfeind elbow sleeve can be found on the side of the bicep and when tightened, the string pulls through the v-shape, as seen in the above picture.
For data collection we used the MotusTHROW sensor, which recently replaced the mThrow.
When asked about the difference via Twitter, Motus Global emphasized that they had ceased supporting the mThrow. But the company said the layout of the printed circuit boards inside the devices had changed, along with the physics engine that produces the metrics from the sensor. A future update to the app will include fingertip velocity, which should correlate better to release speed across pitchers than the current arm speed metric.
From Bryan Cole’s article on field testing the new MotusTHROW
We have always been excited to test out the sleeve developed by Motus Global because of what it could potentially offer; a sense of how stressful a workload is on a pitcher. From this, we would be able to make training decisions based off of those measurements.
In this experiment we were looking specifically at the ‘stress’ measure of the mThrow and seeing if it changed significantly whether the Bauerfeind sleeve was tightened or not. Motus defines their stress metric as “…a measure of the peak torque (Nm) placed on the UCL during the pitch near the time of maximum shoulder rotation…”
However, as Dr. James Buffi has brought up in a previous blog post, it’s very difficult to differentiate the stress that’s occurring on the elbow and the stress that is occurring on the UCL.
After recording the motion of the pitcher’s elbow, most institutions (including Motus and ASMI) use an inverse dynamic process to then calculate the total elbow load (or stress) in the form of a joint torque. Torque is simply force that causes rotation. Calculating this total load is fairly straight forward, as Sir Isaac Newton told us that force equals mass times acceleration. Sparing a few details, this means that the total elbow load is equal to the mass of the forearm and hand multiplied by its rotational acceleration. Now we have come to the gaping hole in this process… how do we calculate the specific load on the UCL from the total elbow load?
Due to the size of both sleeves, the MotusTHROW and sensor was placed on the athlete’s arm first with the Bauerfeind sleeve on top, as pictured below.
mThrow sleeve with Motus sensor underneath the Bauerfeind sleeve
Each of the five athletes wore both sleeves for a flat ground bullpen of 20 pitches. The first 10 pitches were thrown with without any tightening of the Bauerfeind sleeve. while the sleeve was tightened for the last 10 pitches. We did not measure the exact amount that the sleeve restricted motion. The intention was for the sleeve to restrict the last 5-10 degrees of motion an athlete had when fully extending their arm. Making full extension 170-175 degrees.
During testing, the top part of the Bauerfeind sleeve would be pulled down closer to the elbow during the throw, right around the time that elbow extension turns into a release point. We never had an athlete throw and have the string noticeably loosen, instead the top strap on the bicep would not stay in place. Readjustment of the sleeve, loosening of the tightening mechanism happened consistently every three to four throws. A possibility for why this occurred could have been that the Bauerfeind sleeve was on top of the Motus sleeve instead of the athlete’s skin, but similar problematic results were replicated in non-measured trials with the elbow guard in direct contact with a pitcher’s skin.
Our best theory on why stress increased when the sleeve was tightened is that when athletes were throwing, and nearing full elbow extension, more force was required to fight against the resistance that the Bauerfeind sleeve created in order to reach full extension. Instead of stopping the arm from reaching full extension, the player potentially would have to produce more force to reach full extension at release. This caused the sleeve to be pulled down and higher stress readings to appear on the Motus.
The data that we collected showed that four of the five athletes had increased stress on their arm during their 10 throws with the sleeve tightened.
We exposed all of the raw data in this case study; find it here if you are interested in seeing it and running your own analyses.
The ‘stress’ level on our athletes tested ranged anywhere from 20 -70 Nm (Newton metre, measure of torque). This seems to be quite a high range for athletes in similar age and skill level – especially when you consider that the range of the velocity of the five pitchers was large (maximum of 11 MPH difference).
In the end, while we are unsure of how accurate the mThrow’s stress measurement is, the data does not support a reduction of UCL stress while using the Bauerfeind EpiTrain Powerguard as measured by the Motus Global sensor package. Subjectively all five of the athletes who threw and wore the sleeve described the experience as something uncomfortable or feeling as though they couldn’t throw hard. The athlete’s physical comfort must obviously be taken into account prior to creating a program and using a new training tool.

"Are ""Safe"" Training Methods Causing More Injuries? - Driveline Baseball",2016-03-24T04:44:38+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2016/03/are-safe-baseball-training-methods-causing-more-injuries/,"I spoke a little bit about the consequences of safety from a baseball training side in a previous blog post, but there’s another side of this paradigm, which is a little counterintuitive – it’s possible that baseball training methods geared towards “safety” and “injury prevention” are indeed actually causing more injuries.
Vern Gambetta on the HMMR Media / GAIN Podcast had a few things to say about this phenomenon. When he was first getting into professional baseball in the 1980s, light dumbbell shoulder exercises like empty can raises and lateral raises were very popular, and still are today. They are colloquially known as “Jobe” exercises, named after Dr. Frank Jobe, the legendary orthopedic surgeon. Vern said:
Just doing injury prevention exercises… it’s not working, I don’t think… The first thing I saw everyone doing were “Jobe” exercises. We were able to prevent shoulder injuries by getting rid of the “Jobe” exercises… but the focus then became the kinetic chain, the shoulder is only one link in the kinetic chain…
Vern goes on to discuss how building a holistic and transparent program that has so-called “injury prevention” built into the programs and discusses why single-joint exercises and highly-specific light load exercises are indeed not that useful.
The podcast is a great listen, so I highly recommend checking it out at the above link. We’ll reference it a few more times in this article.
Later while Vern was working with an NBA team just a few years ago, he stated the entire roster went through a detailed evaluation about their athletic abilities:
Elaborate evaluation of each athlete… designed to find every deficiency of each athlete about what they could not do… they designed a remedial program but weren’t doing the normal strength program but were still expected to play. This team had the highest number of injuries in the NBA that year! This is ridiculous! They were never training for the game – they were doing low-demand type of work that was designed to address these perceived deficiencies tested in an isolated manner, not an integrated manner.
Inappropriate and too-early specific training to “fix” mechanical and athletic flaws in athletes when their raw output is so low is not only a waste of time, but potentially very injurious. By definition, an athlete with a low ability ceiling cannot meaningfully complete rehabilitation or highly-specific movement retraining modalities with any sort of effort or output that is effective at changing things. High-output constraint training using overload implements (wrist weights, Plyo Ball ®) create a much better bang for the athlete’s buck, developing not only mechanical efficiency but physiological improvement instead of targeting a faulty motor pattern and prescribing advanced exercises that are much better left to the elite athlete who can actually use the transfer properly.
Here’s a sample assessment of an athlete here using a few of the tools we have at our disposal.
Force Plate Analysis – Rocker Throw, 1000g PlyoCare® Ball
Shoulder IR Angular Velocity – Pitch off a Mound
The first graph is a Force Plate analysis of a Rocker Throw (constraint drill) to test the athlete’s ability to transfer force from the back leg to the front leg, block the force, and decelerate. The second graph is a true Biomechanical Analysis of the athlete throwing a max effort fastball off the mound while being filmed using multiple synchronized high-speed cameras, which is turned into a ton of kinematic parameters (shoulder IR angular velocity, elbow extension angular velocity, pelvic speed, hip rotation, torso flexion, etc) – this one happens to be Shoulder Internal Angular Velocity.
This is what shoulder internal rotation looks like, before we go too far off the rails:
Finally, two more markers we measure for this athlete:
The way we would address any flaws based on these readings is highly dependent on two MAJOR factors that are usually overlooked: Age of athlete and ability level of the athlete.
If the athlete in question had all those markers above and threw 75-78 MPH and was 15 years old, it would be highly inappropriate to design an advanced sport-specific program to shore up a bunch of deficiencies (poor lead leg blocking deceleration, faster-than-average external rotation angular velocity, poor ER/IR isometric strength balance), because your general program should be good at addressing these things! If your everyday work does not address these issues in the weight room, throwing program, and warm-up / recovery period, then your program is poorly designed. Now, if the athlete was a 23 year old professional pitcher who threw 93-96 MPH, you would trend further down the sport-specific ramp and work closely to eliminate flaws due to the high amount of energy inherent in the system despite the flaws present.
Mark Rippetoe (author of Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training, amongst other great books) discusses this at length on his website and his books. Rippetoe’s argument is that single-leg and increasingly specific “rehabilitation” exercises do not transfer well to the athletic and total movement required, since coordination and strength is inherently lower when the movement is further isolated.
Here’s an example chart of importance (y-axis) and time (x-axis) of an athlete’s training program at Driveline Baseball as measured by three outputs:
As time goes on and the athlete builds a better engine (ability), increasingly higher demands of sport-specific work is imposed on the athlete through ROM restriction and skill-specific work. The problem is when the graph is reversed or incorrectly aligned – doing more and more isolated and single-joint “rehab” work at low demands not only has poor transfer of training characteristics, but does not adequately prepare the athlete for competition.
A good pure ability development plan raises the floor and ceiling of the athlete’s ability and challenges them above their in-competition loads, ensuring that the game’s output is consistently lower than what they experience in the training room. It’s the logic and reason behind the phrase: “Game day should be your easiest day of the week” and why Ray Lewis said: “You pay me for Monday through Saturday. Sunday you get for free.”
Intermuscular coordination, multi-joint, and multiplane exercises are the best way to build the base of any training program – including any program that aims to reduce injury risk. The problem begins and is compounded when trainers and coaches get too fancy, too soon, and with too low output of athletes. One college baseball team’s pitching coach told me that nearly 100% of their athletes got hurt who had programs designed by a well-known “sports science” place! When I reviewed the training material, it was clear these programs were way too sport-specific and far too ballistic in nature – without enough general physical preparedness or raw strength – that when it came to game time and competition, they simply did not have enough underlying coordination and strength to handle the imposed demands, despite being really good at sport-specific movements. This is a real risk when you do not adjust your programming based on the athlete’s output level.
At the end of the day, trying to reduce injury risk by “assessing” and attacking it directly can often lead to worsening problems. Do not ignore general (GPP) before specific (SPP) work, and never neglect GPP maintenance in elite athletes. It’s a plane ticket to soft tissue injuries and severely hampered recovery markers.

Can Imaginary Exercise Make a Pitcher Better? - Driveline Baseball,2015-06-05T02:06:24+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/06/can-imaginary-exercise-make-a-pitcher-better/,"I won’t bury the lead. The answer is yes, it is highly likely that imaginary exercise can make a pitcher better.
In the early 90s, several researchers set out to test the efficacy of pure imaginary exercise on the strength of a finger [1]. (The finger was chosen because it has small muscles that are easy to test and isolate.)  The researchers had three groups of subjects: group 1 performed actual finger exercises, group 2 performed no finger exercises, and group 3 simply imagined the finger exercises performed by group 1.
After 4 weeks, the results were pretty incredible.
As expected, the subjects in the first group (the subjects that completed the actual exercises) increased the strength of the exercised finger by 30% on average. Also as expected, the subjects in the second group did not substantially increase the strength of the finger.
Now here’s the incredible part… the subjects in the third group, the subjects that only imagined exercises without actually activating muscles, increased the force output of the “exercised” finger by 22%.
Pure imaginary exercises significantly increased the force output of the tested finger muscles. In the imposed experimental protocol, the muscles did not get bigger and stronger… so what happened?
With the imaginary exercises, the subjects’ nervous systems became more effective at accomplishing the desired task. Their brains learned to more effectively activate the targeted muscles.
How the Nervous System Activates Muscles
The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and nerves. This system is essentially the controller of the body. It turns the muscles on when they need to be on and off when they need to be off.
To turn a muscle on, the brain generates an electrochemical signal that travels down the spinal cord and into the desired muscle through a nerve. This signal is called an action potential [2].
One action potential does not turn on a whole muscle. One action potential activates a small group of muscle fibers, called a motor unit, within a muscle [2].
As I mentioned previously, one muscle is made up of many muscle fibers. And each muscle fiber has different speed, strength, and endurance characteristics. The fibers that contract more slowly are generally weaker and more resistant to fatigue. The fibers that contract more quickly are typically stronger and more susceptible to fatigue.
Muscle fibers are organized into motor units of similar size, speed, strength, and endurance characteristics [2].
The initial action potentials sent from the brain to a muscle turn on the slowest and weakest motor units in the muscle [2]. As the brain sends more action potentials at faster speeds and frequencies, more motor units get turned on to participate in the desired muscular task. In general, each additional motor unit that gets recruited is bigger, faster, and stronger than the previous one.
Moreover, motor units are not recruited one at a time. They add up [2]. The bigger and stronger units are added to the smaller and weaker ones to generate a more powerful muscle contraction. This is known as the size principle.
Conversely, if the brain does not send action potentials at fast enough speeds, the faster and stronger motor units are never activated. They are never recruited and only the slower and weaker motor units participate in the desired task.
So what causes the brain to send more action potentials at faster speeds to recruit the most powerful motor units in a muscle?
Why Intent Matters in Pitching Training
It is the level of exertion, or intent, which determines the amount of motor units recruited to perform a task [2].
Increased intent may help explain how imaginary exercise can increase muscle force output. Imaginary exercise seems to teach the nervous system to perform a task with greater intent, facilitating the recruitment of more powerful muscle motor units.
The level of exertion, or intent, with which an athlete performs a task, is determined by the athlete’s level of focus and effort. Imaginary exercise can improve both.
However, despite the effectiveness of imaginary exercise, I am not advocating that a pitcher should skip the training room and just visualize pitching in the big leagues. As demonstrated by the finger experiment described above, a training regimen that exercises both the nervous system AND the musculoskeletal system is most effective.
Want to get started training with intent? Driveline’s Starter Kit has a simple, effective program to get you started.
Simple Training Techniques to Fire Up the Nervous System
So here’s the take-away message for pitchers and really all athletes:
Physical exercise should always be accompanied by mental exercise. Never go through the motions. Always try to complete the task you are practicing with greater intent.
When throwing a bullpen, a pitcher should throw each pitch like it’s the ninth inning of a one run game. During long toss, a pitcher should focus on generating power that will translate to the mound. When practicing with a heavier ball, a pitcher should focus on learning the feeling of throwing the heavier object with maximum efficiency. And the list goes on…learn the goal of a drill and then focus on completing the goal.
Practicing with greater intent will lead to nervous system adaptation. Over time, the nervous system will learn to activate more powerful motor units.
For pitchers, activating more powerful motor units leads to better performance, typically in the form of increased velocity.
One way to start practicing with greater intent is to try an unfamiliar exercise regimen. An unfamiliar task requires more focus and thus typically engages the nervous system to a greater extent. For this reason, it is beneficial for pitchers to mix up their training programs and try new things.
A training program only composed of long toss will not be nearly as effective as a program composed of many different training modalities.
Theoretical Implications for Rehabbing Pitchers
Rehabbing athletes who are unable to complete physical exercise should especially take advantage of the adaptability of the nervous system. For example, a pitcher who is recovering from Tommy John surgery can effectively mentally practice his or her windup before ever touching a baseball. Even imaginary biceps curls or shoulder rotations may speed up post-surgery recovery.
And if pure imaginary exercise is too difficult, a rehabbing pitcher can try exercising his or her non-dominant arm. Studies have shown that exercising the non-dominant arm increases the strength of the dominant arm, or vice versa, through similar neural adaptation mechanisms [2].
It is easy to neglect nervous system exercise. It doesn’t make you sweat or cause a muscle to swell. But this system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and nerves, determines how much of your muscle capacity you use.
Therefore, it is critical to give the nervous system as much attention in training as the musculoskeletal system.
An athlete who uses 90% of a weaker muscle can be just as effective as an athlete who uses 30% of a stronger muscle. And neither athlete will be as effective as the guy or girl who uses 90% of the strongest muscle.

Why Sir Isaac Newton is Still the Foremost Expert in Pitching Biomechanics - Driveline Baseball,2015-04-30T00:31:17+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/04/why-sir-isaac-newton-is-still-the-foremost-expert-in-pitching-biomechanics/,"This post was written by Dr. James Buffi.
Most people have heard of Sir Isaac Newton and his famous laws of motion. Most have not heard that he was an expert in modern pitching biomechanics.
So let’s talk about how Newton’s most famous law relates to pitching.
Newton’s most famous law of motion is probably F = ma. Force equals mass times acceleration.
This law dictates that the acceleration of an object, like a baseball, is dependent on both its mass and the outside forces acting on it. F = ma is the foundation of all mechanical analyses and therefore it’s important for pitchers (and really all athletes) to understand what it means.
In F = ma, the “m” stands for mass. Mass is a measure of how much matter, or “stuff,” an object contains. An object can be really large in volume but have very little mass, and vice versa.
A blimp is huge, but relatively speaking, it does not have as much mass as one would expect because it is filled with gas. The mass of a typical baseball is 145 grams, which weighs about 5 ounces.
Next, let’s look at the “a” in the equation. The letter “a” in F = ma stands for acceleration. To understand acceleration, it is best to start by understanding the concept of distance. Distance is the space between two points. For example, the distance between the pitching rubber and home plate is 60 feet 6 inches.
Velocity measures distance traveled per unit of time. So a 95 mile per hour fastball can travel 95 miles in one hour. 95 miles per hour is about 140 feet per second. In other words, it takes less than half a second for a 95 mph fastball to travel from the pitcher’s hand to the catcher’s mitt.
Acceleration measures how much velocity is changing. It measures the rate of change in velocity. The size of the acceleration, the amount of time over which it occurs, and the initial velocity, determine an object’s final velocity. The concept of acceleration is a little trickier to understand than velocity. It is measured in distance per time, per time.
For example, in a pitching motion, the acceleration of the baseball could be 95 miles per hour, per second. In this case, the velocity of the ball would change from zero mph (i.e. not moving) to a velocity of 95 mph (i.e. moving really fast) in one second.
The acceleration phase of a pitching motion, in which the ball accelerates from rest to its release velocity, is generally much shorter than one second. The fastest cars in the world accelerate from zero to 60 mph in several seconds… so, in this way, the body can accelerate faster than an Italian sports car.
Now how do we cause an object with mass to accelerate?
We apply a force to it. This is the meaning of F= ma. An object will accelerate as long as there is net force acting on it.
And the size of the acceleration is dependent on the amount of mass and the size of the force. For the same net force, an object with less mass will accelerate more than an object with more mass.
A force can be thought of as a push or pull on an object. In the baseball pitching motion, the hand applies a force to the ball by “pushing” it. This causes it to accelerate from rest to its final velocity at release. In a similar manner, the forearm applies a force to the hand causing the hand to accelerate. The upper arm also applies a force to the forearm, and so on down the kinetic chain of body segments.
The force that one body segment exerts on another is transmitted through a wide variety of structures, including bones, muscles, and ligaments. One of the ligaments through which force is transmitted from the upper arm to the forearm is the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL).
As I’ve said before, for a specific pitcher, it remains unclear how much force is felt specifically by the UCL during each individual pitch. Researchers have attempted to gain a better understanding of UCL loading during pitching by calculating the total force load on the elbow under a variety of conditions. They’ve done this using an approach called inverse dynamics.
Researchers have calculated the total elbow load experienced by youth, high school, college, and pro pitchers [1-6]. They have calculated and compared the total elbow load for fastballs, curveballs, sliders, and change ups [7-9]. They have performed many similar studies and this is what they’ve found: F = ma.
Unless a pitcher totally changes his or her pitching motion, the only way to substantially increase the final velocity of a pitched baseball is to increase the magnitude of its acceleration. And the only way to increase acceleration is to apply a greater force.
Hence, the aforementioned studies have shown that when pitchers throw regulation baseballs faster or farther, they experiences greater total elbow forces.
In essence, they’ve shown that to increase “a” one must increase “F.”
This academic literature is a primary reason why some believe curveballs are less dangerous than fastballs. Curveballs are thrown with less velocity and thus require less force. This literature is also why some coaches are hesitant to include long toss in training routines.
It is true that faster pitches and longer tosses generally require increased elbow loading. However, the total force on the elbow is not the force on the UCL. I firmly believe that pitchers can safely throw faster and farther with proper training and without drastic changes to their pitching motions.
The ligaments are not the only structures crossing the elbow. Many muscles do as well. And the primary purpose of these muscles is to transmit force.
Despite the biological complexity of joints like the elbow, there is a severe lack of anatomical and physiological considerations in most modern discussions of pitching biomechanics. People may talk about things like arm slot and forearm pronation, but they don’t talk about muscles, bones, and other connective tissues.
To summarize where the field of pitching biomechanics currently stands, it has been confirmed that F = ma. We have confirmed that Sir Isaac Newton’s most basic law still holds during the pitching motion. He is still the foremost expert in pitching biomechanics.
Now we need to press onward. It is time to stop focusing so much on total force and total torque (torque is the rotational equivalent of force).
Instead, we need to understand how total force is distributed among the internal structures of the body (i.e. muscles, bones and ligaments). We need to know how these internal structures are able to produce 100 mph fastballs and not break. Let’s incorporate some anatomy and physiology into our biomechanical studies of pitching. Maybe focus a little more on the “bio” in biomechanics.
Knowledge of force is important, but knowledge of how this force interacts with human biology is just as critical. The body is made of adaptable, living tissue. We should analyze it accordingly.
The following are some physiology-based questions I am currently considering using computational modeling techniques.
And so on…
There are countless essential questions remaining unanswered about human physiology during pitching. These questions make it a very exciting time for researchers, like me, who are fascinated by the complexity of the body… and also love baseball.

Challenges with Typical Biomechanical Analyses of Pitching - Driveline Baseball,2015-02-18T21:29:53+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2015/02/challenges-typical-biomechanical-analyses-pitching/,"This is a guest post from Dr. James H. Buffi, Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering.
It is impossible to overstate how excited I am to have Dr. Buffi contribute to our blog in what will be the first article in a three-part series on the biomechanics of pitching. In 2014, Dr. Buffi had a paper published title Computing Muscle, Ligament, and Osseous Contributions to the Elbow Varus Moment During Baseball Pitching (pubmed) which absolutely stunned me with the new methodology he had taken. Prior to that, Dr. Buffi had presented a conference paper titled Effect of Forearm Posture on the Elbow Varus Torque Generated by the Flexor Pronator Muscles: Implications for the Ulnar Collateral Ligament (pdf) which has been quoted on this blog and on my Twitter feed many times.
Dr. Buffi reached out to me not long ago and we had a great conversation where we discussed where we thought the future of baseball training would be going and where it needed to improve to make serious dents on the rash of elbow injuries that all pitchers are dealing with, from Little League to MLB. It is my pleasure to provide a platform for Dr. Buffi to present his views and to announce that he will be working with Driveline Baseball in the future in some capacity!

Challenges with Typical Biomechanical Analyses of Pitching
Have we found the Tommy John solution?
Is this the sleeve that could save baseball?
These are the questions being posed by baseball enthusiasts as the company Motus Global markets a compression sleeve that pitchers can wear to monitor and manage the workloads on their pitching elbows.
I have played baseball since I first learned to walk. I am a fanatic about the sport in every sense of the word. I also have a PhD in biomedical engineering and I can tell you that the Motus sleeve will probably not save baseball from the epidemic of elbow ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tears that lead to Tommy John surgeries.
To be clear, I am in no way saying that the Motus sleeve is without value. From what I know, I actually think it is a solid first step. The Motus sleeve takes baseball biomechanical analyses out of the laboratory and onto the playing field in live game situations, and it provides a method for tracking your workouts and monitoring your mechanics. These are definitely good things.
However, I do have some serious questions about the claim that the Motus sleeve monitors the load on your UCL. Moreover, there are systematic challenges with the biomechanical analyses being utilized by most institutions, including the American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI), that try to prevent UCL injuries by monitoring total elbow loading or total elbow stress.
All biomechanical analyses of pitching begin the same way. First, the pitching motion, and specifically the acceleration of the elbow, is recorded in three dimensions. This is often done using markers and cameras, or it is done using small inertial measurement units similar to the components that allow smart phones to detect landscape versus portrait mode. The Motus sleeve uses the latter approach.
After recording the motion of the pitcher’s elbow, most institutions (including Motus and ASMI) use an inverse dynamic process to then calculate the total elbow load (or stress) in the form of a joint torque. Torque is simply force that causes rotation. Calculating this total load is fairly straight forward, as Sir Isaac Newtown told us that force equals mass times acceleration. Sparing a few details, this means that the total elbow load is equal to the mass of the forearm and hand multiplied by its rotational acceleration.
Now we have come to the gaping hole in this process… how do we calculate the specific load on the UCL from the total elbow load?
The UCL is basically a tiny band that connects the humerus to the ulna, and as far as I know, it is actually impossible with existing methodologies to accurately determine UCL loading when only the total elbow load is considered. This ligament is only a few centimeters in size and it is in close proximity to many muscles and other soft tissue. It is loaded (i.e. it feels a force) when it is stretched, similar to an elastic band. The image below shows the musculature of the left forearm. The UCL is hidden beneath the highlighted muscle near the elbow.
There are more than 10 muscles that cross the elbow [1], and when we only consider the total elbow load, we really have no way of calculating how any of these muscles are individually affecting the load on the UCL during a pitch. Scientists have used experiments in cadavers to show that the muscles on the inside of the elbow (the medial side) can relieve a load on the UCL [2-4]. The problem is these experiments cannot yet be replicated in living subjects.
Additionally, the bones of the elbow also provide substantial stability. Back in 1983, Dr. Morrey and Dr. An reported that just the bones and the joint capsule can support upwards of 40% of an applied elbow load [5]. However, this study was also completed in cadavers and muscles were not considered because the cadavers were dissected.
Furthermore, I published an academic article in 2014 that showed via simulation that the load on the UCL can range from catastrophic to nonexistent depending on the contributions from the muscles and bones [6].
Therefore, it remains unclear how the total elbow load relates to the specific load on the UCL. For a given elbow load, the UCL load could be really high if the muscles and bones are weak, or it could be really low if the muscles and bones are strong.
Consider the following thought experiment: If you have two teams of 15 people playing tug-of-war and the only thing you can measure is the total load on the rope, are you able to determine the specific load supported by any individual person on either team?
This is an impossible task.
Now the question we must ask is: can we develop effective training plans using the measurements of elbow loading provided by the Motus sleeve and other typical biomechanical analyses?
Without more information, the answer is likely no.
If a pitcher has a higher total elbow load, but also capable muscles and bones that protect his UCL, he may be able to push himself more in his throwing program when the typical advice would be to scale back. Muscles get stronger by overloading, not underloading. If a pitcher has a lower total elbow load, but also much less capable muscles and bones, he may actually be at a higher risk for UCL injury than one would expect. In this case, the pitcher may need to reduce his workload until he strengthens his muscles, while the typical advice would be to do the opposite and ramp up throwing.
The bottom line is that the total elbow load or the total elbow stress is a very poor predictor of UCL injury risk. In fact, excessively monitoring a pitcher’s total elbow load could actually increase his injury risk. If a pitcher were to scale his workload back too much in response to elevated elbow loading, he could actually weaken his muscles and therefore increase his risk for a UCL tear and a Tommy John surgery. This means that improper use of the Motus sleeve could actually be very dangerous for baseball.
In my own biomechanical analyses of pitching, I avoid the pitfalls mentioned above by monitoring the loads on individual muscles and ligaments. I accomplish this using advanced numerical methods and an anatomically-based computer model of the human body. This approach will enable targeted training of specific muscles and more accurate assessments of UCL vulnerability.
There may not be a solution to the Tommy John epidemic just yet, but I am confident we can change this very soon with the right scientific approach.

Great stuff. It’s awesome seeing people working on this problem scientifically instead of from either a money making side (Modus sleeve) or from simple guess work (throw less throw less!).  Keep up the great work!
I think the Motus Sleeve will be great. But I don’t think it’s the final answer to everything like it’s being pushed in the media. In fact, I’ve ordered three units and I’m waiting on them to ship. They promised a mid-February launch date, but I haven’t heard anything and I’ve pinged them a few times….
Would love to hear any recommendations in terms of exercise selection to implement in an arm care program that Dr. Buffi suggests.
That’s where we hope Driveline Baseball + Dr. Buffi’s research will work together!
Maybe this explains why Japanese pitchers can successfully throw a lot more pitches in a game. Its’ training their muscle more; it would be an interesting study comparing the two countries.
I personally believe most of the arm problems occur because kids suppinate their arm during release, rather than pronate. To pronate the thumb touches opposite side pocket on release is correct in the finishing position for a 4 seam fastball. To suppinate, the baby finger touching pocket and is unhealthy for developing age players.
They and their parents and coaches think they are throwing a fast ball, but they are really throwing a type of curve. You can test this out by playing catch with a kid and watch the ball come into your glove. If it doesn’t have backspin and 12/6 rotation, (proper 4 seam fastball movement) his arm slot is wrong and most likely due to the finishing position of his hand. The sooner it’s corrected the better for both arm care health and accuracy in fielding plays.

Thanks for the interesting article. I always enjoy reading what Biomechanical engineers write. There is something I would like to see, and that is a graph of the forces on the elbow during a pitching cycle, so a proper exercise program can be developed. The missing piece that is not discussed is the neurological component. An example of this would be if the muscle spindle cell get damaged, then the reaction time changes.  This could lead to a functional weakness at a time when strength is required to off load the ulnar collateral ligament.
Great article and looking forward to the others!

Post-Activation Potentiation with Weighted Baseballs,2014-09-29T12:51:35+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/09/post-activation-potentiation-weighted-baseballs/,"Post-Activation Potentiation (PAP) is a controversial topic in exercise science, with research pointing in favor and against it working. PAP is not easy to describe, but the simplest way to put it is to think about testing your 60-yd dash time shortly after squatting 3-5 reps of heavy weight. The idea is that by “potentiating” the central nervous system (CNS) using heavy movements, performance increases in subsequent lighter and explosive movements.
First and foremost, it’s important to note that the most popular method of PAP in baseball does NOT work – using a donut or weighted bat sleeve in the on-deck circle before going up to hit.
Dr. Coop DeRenne, a legend in the world of baseball performance science, studied this very phenomenon years ago. Donuts used prior to swinging a real bat show a marked decrease in bat speed, yet hitters use them all the time. The reason for this isn’t because athletes are smarter or more experienced than sports scientists running controlled experiments, of course, it’s just a mix of inertia, superstition, and fear.
Or you could ask the scholarly people in the comments of major news sites, who have stunning results to share with us all:
Thanks, Doctor.
The reason that PAP doesn’t work in the on-deck circle is because the use of the donut in an attempt to increase the bat weight makes no effort to grasp the significantly changed biomechanics of the swing by adding 200% or more of the weight to the bat in an uneven distribution. This makes the loaded donut swing a completely different motor pattern by drastically changing not only the mass of the bat, but the moment of inertia (MOI) of the bat as well.
In short, it doesn’t work. So if you use donuts in the on-deck circle (or at all, really), you should stop.
Ah, this is the million dollar question, isn’t it? What about throwing weighted baseballs prior to pitching to potentiate the CNS to increase output?
I think this is a rather fascinating concept, and as it so happens, we’ve studied this effect as best we can in the Driveline Sports Science lab. There are three generally-accepted methods of how PAP works, and the primary one we focused on was the idea that increased recruitment of higher order motor units would activate other motor units to allow for greater than average neuromuscular performance.
Study
Have athletes test run-and-gun velocities with a standard (5 oz) ball after a dynamic warm-up, then throw 6 oz and 7 oz overload balls for 3-5 reps each. After that, test run-and-gun velocities with the standard (5 oz) ball again and see if there are significant changes.
We also tested the OPPOSITE effect – we had athletes throw underload baseballs instead of overload to see if activation might work in a different manner.
Results
We split the athletes into two even groups as randomly as possible while controlling for age and skill level.
First we’ll discuss the underload group: It was a disaster. Subjectively the athletes overwhelmingly hated it when feedback was solicited, and objectively the data was clear as day – velocities went directly into the tank by 2+ standard deviations.
Some things said:
Pretty clear loser there. We moved underload balls back to where they’ve always been – at the end of the velocity run-and-gun tests.
The overload group, on the other hand, had mixed but statistically insignificant results. No athletes complained about the grouping of the weighted ball throws (5-6-7-5-4-3 oz) and while the average of the group saw higher velocities, it wasn’t statistically significant – and some lost velocity after throwing the overload baseballs. Some statistically insignificant trends that seemed worthy of future study were found, however:
Overall, I think the idea of PAP is very interesting and perhaps useful when it comes to weighted baseballs, but perhaps not prior to a game. Our study was a very limited trial that did not test one of the most important variables in a game – endurance.
It’s very possible that a comprehensive dynamic warm-up using proper tools captures enough of the “PAP” benefits, and athletes who do not warm-up and potentiate the CNS correctly prior to training or competing may see phantom benefits from what they think is truly PAP.
In that vein, however, we recommend all athletes use Plyo Ball ® to warm-up alongside their dynamic warm-up that should feature resistance bands, foam rollers, and other techniques to properly prepare the body and mind for competing on the diamond.
Yup, my son wanted to be like everyone else and use a donut. I didn’t let him.
But there was that one study that showed a significant positive effect for female softballers. Don’t know if it was ever replicated.
I don’t get this:
“……idea of PAP is very interesting and perhaps useful when it comes to weighted baseballs, but perhaps not prior to a game.”
Then:
“we recommend all athletes use PlyoCare balls ….. to properly prepare the body and mind for competing on the diamond.”
Plyos are weighted balls too. I don’t get the distinction being made here.
We split the distinction between PlyoCare balls and Driveline Elite Weighted Balls (which I refer to as “weighted balls”). Sorry for the confusion
Which means you’ve tested plyos as an effective warmup for throwing from the bump. I saw your tweet pics showing them in your own adult league throwing. Will this be covered in the upcoming book? Did Beav pitchers do this last season?
Yes, though my warm-up with PlyoCare balls is for a different reason. I have a partial thickness tear in my infraspinatus (and likely serious fraying in the supraspinatus), and I use them to activate my posterior shoulder. I’ll do upwards of 40-65 reps (split across 4-6 sets) of external rotation tosses into the air with the 1kg PlyoCare ball prior to picking up a baseball. Usually I do them after foam rolling, LAX ball rollouts, resistance band work, and arm oscillation work (I carry a Total Bar with me since it’s a little more portable than a Shoulder Tube).
It’ll be covered in the upcoming book for sure. Beaver pitchers did not use PlyoCare balls in warm-ups much, or at least it was not prescribed (some may have individually). This year may be different.
Hi Kyle, in regards to what you posted, “weighted ball throws (5-6-7-5-4-3 oz)” is this also in the same order when you guys do regular velo work? Or was this just the order for the study?
Thank you
Just for the study. This sequence also appears in our free weighted baseball eBook, available under “Our Books” in the top nav bar.
I looked in the eBook. What page is it on because the order looks different?
Just as a side note… While training swings (not hitting or barrel accuracy, but swing patterns) I find it very useful when the athlete has an uncomfortably weighted bat to swing. I prefer just a heavy wood bat, but I get really good results from bat weights( the jack-it and donuts). The point is that that pattern needs to be strongly mapped and the athlete needs to have the wherewithal not to press the hands/arms to get the barrel into the zone. This ties into how weighted balls and plyo balls can rewrite inefficient patterns. At first, a poor thrower may push the heavier ball. Good coaching cues, dynamic actions with focus and intent can iron out the process and pattern quickly. With the swing, a heavy bat will help the athlete feel the depth of the barrel bottom out early in the turn in the proper pattern. Like the tendency for an inefficient thrower to push a heavier object at first, heavy bats will further ingrain a bad pressing pattern when left unattended. Also, the different placements of donut  weights, jack-its etc can make this even harder to recognize as you described since sometimes more weight is felt closer to the hands. This is like anything else, any good drill can be woefully miscued or misconstrued by an athlete. Likewise, seemingly ridiculously drill work like throwing heavy balls hard in a pick-off stance can have truly breakthrough results with the right constraints being met. I like to test the “stickiness” of a pattern by seeing the athlete maintain his turn, barrel action depth and momentum transfer hold up to variable bat weights and balances.
What sorts of drills are used with the Plyocare balls? I’ve been looking everywhere and can only find a couple drills in your videos, was wondering if theres anywhere that you talk about drills, rep schemes, etc with them. Thanks
That information is forthcoming in our flagship book and video set product, due out this offseason (December 1st, hopefully).
Hi Kyle,
Back in 2013 Graeme Lehman posted an article on his site regarding a study, ” The acute and chronic effects of isometric contraction conditioning on baseball bat velocity” indicating that a simple on deck warm up routine that induced PAP with isometric contractions increased bat speed. The protocol involved hitters performing four reps of max effort isometric contraction for 5 seconds. A five second rest was allowed between repetitions. The first and third sets used the lead hand while the second and forth sets used the trail hand.  They then rested for one minute and were then able to swing harder than before. As hitting and pitching have similar rotational qualities, do you have any thoughts on whether this might be beneficial for pitchers? Lehman was also considering a study for pitchers using the “Hershiser drill” as the isometric contraction, however, I haven’t seen anything from him on this. Curious to get your thoughts.
[…] This follows our standard regular-overload-regular-underload pattern that we’ve tested over the years. […]

The 2013-2014 Driveline Baseball Offseason Wrap-Up - Driveline Baseball,2014-03-01T05:11:27+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/03/2013-2014-driveline-baseball-offseason-wrap/,"This last year was our biggest and best year – explosive growth, lots of breakthroughs, and a heck of a lot of fun. Here’s some of the critical things that happened over the past six months, what I learned, where I could have improved, and some plans for the next six months.
Managing our athletes’ nagging soreness, pain, and injuries has always been at the forefront of what we do. We’ve always been huge on “prehab” and warm-ups, including foam rolling, resistance band exercises, manual resistance methods, and so much more. However, we were lacking a good post-throwing protocol. Over the 2013 regular season for our guys, I spent a lot of time researching and experimenting with different methods, and I’m very pleased to say that we have a great plan in place now. Our athletes are always saying how great their arms feel after the protocol, and it can all be done in about 15 minutes.
A major addition to the post-throwing program that we added recently was using 360 degrees of compression using Voodoo Bands from Rogue to cut swelling ASAP and to take guys through limited ROM movements with the wraps on to improve proprioception. We’ve also added the use of Flex-Bars to attack elbow tendonitis/tendonosis before it occurs, and we’ve doubled down on oscillation therapy using Shoulder Tubes as well as reciprocal training using rebounders and Driveline Plyo Ball ®.
However, like anything else, this plan can get better. I’m incredibly excited to announce our partnership with Marc Pro, which is the most advanced electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) device on the market. We have just begun to roll out the use of the Marc Pro by itself as well as in combination with limited ROM movement to remap movement patterns. Many MLB teams and Division-I colleges use this product and I’ve gotten a deluge of testimonials from people I highly trust, including Dave Coggin of PFA Fitness down in LA.
For those who follow us on Twitter or YouTube, you already know that we do a lot of weighted ball training with soft sand-filled balls (currently TAP balls but soon will be exclusive Driveline Plyo Ball ®) as well as stitched weighted baseballs (Driveline Elite Weighted Baseballs). We’ve used 2-4 lb. balls for arm care for years, but we’ve recently expanded our use of the xpxlyometricxx soft sand-filled balls and the results have been awesome.
We plan on making our dual protocol even better by swapping out some of the movements/drills that aren’t getting the maximum impact we’d like (which we evaluate using our high-speed cameras and EMG sensors – find a baseball facility near you that does that!) and adding a bunch of new ones to make big breakthroughs in arm strength and endurance. Our program is already one of the best in the world at developing velocity, and while we do a good job at increasing recovery potential and arm endurance, we could get a lot better there – and we will!
Driveline Baseball has always had a major strength and conditioning component in it, dating back to our 400 square foot shack in North Seattle.
However, despite investing a lot of money into a ton of great equipment, we’ve really lagged here. I plan on doubling down for the 2014 regular season and next off-season to make this a huge priority going forward!
No surprise here; we still use a ton of high-speed video. We’ve started to make use of our newly developed four-camera synchronized system in addition to the high-speed cameras we have:
Overlay video has been a hot topic here, since we are actively working on research on pitchability, pitch sequencing, and attacking hitters. Tunneling theory was pioneered by Perry Husband in his book series, Downright Filthy Pitching, and though I don’t agree with Perry’s theories on the Hitter Attention Theory (we’re using PITCHf/x research to really study this), his work on tunneling makes a lot of sense to us.
Here’s an example of pitch tunneling via overlay video: We worked closely with Drew Rasmussen on keeping his change-up and slider in the same tunnel to really increase deception, and based on the results he’s had at Perfect Game and other pro showcases, I’d say it’s been working just fine!
We recently released our book focusing on training youth pitchers called The Dynamic Pitcher. It’s been a massive success, outselling even the best projections I had for the book, and the results our clients have had (including our 11U Showtime Baseball Team) have been nothing short of awesome.
However, writing our first large book and taking videos for public consumption was much tougher than anticipated! Yes, while writing a book and shooting a lot of video is obviously tough, I severely underestimated the amount of overhead that came with it in the form of increased communication with tons of prospective buyers and clients. It’s been a blast since we’ve learned a ton, but I hope to hire some part-time help starting next off-season to address this issue as well as a few other areas – especially since my general training book on velocity development and pitching should be out by then!
It’s been a hell of a year and we can’t wait to continue growing. The 2014 MLB draft is going to be a fun one to follow (as well as tracking the results of our current professional pitchers), and I hope to write up my experiences with consulting with a bunch of Division-I programs and professional organizations. But more on that in a future post!
Rebounders before or after weighted ball pulldowns?
After, usually.

"A Follow-Up on NPA-Style ""Holds"" - Driveline Baseball",2014-02-06T21:30:44+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/02/follow-npa-style-holds/,"Dan Blewett of Warbird Academy wrote a great post on the NPA-style holds that Steve Delabar popularized through Tom House and Jamie Evans, and I urge you to read it: Holds, Pitching Velocity, and Tom House Tennis Analogy.
Dan makes a TON of great points, one of which I wish I was smart enough to have realized myself when it comes to our Ballistic Reverse Throws (he even embedded our video):
Baseball pitchers internally rotate to throw a pitch. This means that three of the four rotator cuff muscles are eccentrically decelerating, not accelerating the ball. Thus, these three muscles – the supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor – rarely get any concentric strengthening in the sport itself. This is not the case in tennis.
Rather, tennis players hit backhands, which is a concentric exercise for the scapula retractors, external rotators of the cuff and other back muscles. When Tom House talks about balance, he seems to forget that Tennis players get balance in their musculature from hitting backhands. Baseball players do not get this.
Conclusion: The backhand appears to strengthen the rotator cuff and back muscles in a way that the baseball throw cannot. This strengthening could be a large reason tennis shoulders resist injury.
The video in question is here:
Which remains one of our favorite training exercises and a major staple in our Elite Pitching Program.
We took some initial EMG data on the NPA-style holds with athletes who previously trained under the NPA Velocity Plus program, and what we found was fairly interesting:
Most training programs seek to reduce middle deltoid activity, as engaging that large part of the shoulder can aggravate impingement issues in the shoulder. Holds seem to do better than I thought they would, but there is still the real possibility of the “negative blend” of contracting the medial forearm and “pushing” the baseball – not movement patterns we want to mimic at all in the pitching delivery, while we want that aggressive shoulder rotation you see in ballistic reverse throws and we want the aggressive pronation hand speed in the wrist weight throws!
The study isn’t yet complete, but the initial data definitely seems to support my initial argument as well as Dan’s.
Kyle, I love the amount of research you’ve put into this information.  My son uses NPA and has had great results.  Driveline seems to be a good program.  It is obvious you don’t agree with NPA.  Why don’t you and House get together on this?  It would alleviate much confusion.  People need answers.  When two great programs oppose one another, it makes it confusing for parents of pitchers who want the best for their kids.  House is seasoned and comes with years of experience on and off the mound.  No one can refute that.  You both have gotten amazing results.  If the goal is to change the baseball world, who cares who gets the credit?
Thanks for the comment! At Driveline, we want to put forth what we believe to be the best exercises in comparison with what else is out there, but none of our goals includes making enemies. We want everyone to gain the proper knowledge in order to excel at playing the great game of baseball. Please, email into our support team at [email protected] if you want to talk specifics about any of the programs/exercises we provide, and why we do them.

Driveline Sports Science - Moving into a New Era of Sports Performance - Driveline Baseball,2014-01-09T16:07:07+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2014/01/driveline-sports-science/,"I’m pleased to announce that we will be slowly transitioning our Driveline Biomechanics Laboratory into a more general term, namely the Driveline Sports Science Lab. While we started years ago with the lofty goal of digitizing kinematic data of pitchers and picking apart training modalities based on our findings, we have progressed significantly farther since then.
While we haven’t written much about the facility upgrades, I assure you that we’ve been incredibly busy behind the scenes. Here’s a list of what we’ve been working on and what you can expect if you decide to train here in our Elite Pitcher Program:
High-Speed Video Analysis
Our Sports Science Lab has high-speed cameras available for every single athlete throwing in a pitching group. That’s right – not just one high-speed camera, but multiple ones for use by ANY pitcher to evaluate their mechanics, training methods, and movement patterns.
Four-Camera Synchronized System
The throwing bullpen area has a professional mound with MLB length and slope unlike your average cheaply-built indoor mounds. This mound features a four-camera synchronized camera system which captures your pitching mechanics in real-time and is available for viewing on one of our two external monitors installed specifically for clients to review their mechanics.
Video Overlay Technology
Do your pitches get hit hard despite great movement and velocity? Most pitching coaches simply guess at how to get guys out. We’ve developed a scientific way of attacking hitters. In our database of seven full minor and major league baseball seasons, we have every single pitch thrown during the regular season and playoffs. Using this data, we created an exhaustive list on what sequences of pitches get hit hard and likely trajectories of each ball. Ever see the guy throwing 97+ MPH but getting shelled yet watch Koji Uehara of the Boston Red Sox sit guys down with an 88 MPH fastball where they are swinging and missing? We can teach you how to create that kind of deception, and it has nothing to do with “hiding the ball” or other useless coaching tips.
EMG Sensors
Biomechanics only tell you so much – it’s not enough to know the what. We must know the how. But to find out how your body produces the movement patterns you see on high-speed video, you need to analyze the underlying muscle activity. EMG sensors can tell you that, but most on the market are highly intrusive and/or bulky, requiring wires all over the place. Not at the Driveline Sports Science Lab, where our sEMG sensors stick easily on the body without affecting release velocity or mechanics. We use these sensors to really validate what training modalities do for our pitchers and to monitor recovery.
Force Plate Analysis
Ground reaction forces are everything. The pitching delivery starts with a transfer of weight from the back side to the front side, initiating linear movement… and if that movement isn’t ideally timed or explosive enough, you dump speed-strength right off the bat. Force plate analysis measures the efficiency, peak power production, and rate of force development of an athlete from both a bilateral and unilateral sense. By analyzing force production curves against time, we can design better training methods to bring out the elite athlete inside you.
Advanced Weight Room
She doesn’t look like much, but she’s got it where it counts. The Driveline Sports Science weight room is fully-equipped with a wide variety of specialty barbells, cardio equipment (ergometer, Prowler sled), specialty equipment (glute-ham raise, cable machine with multiple attachment points), and everything in-between to make you a stronger, faster, and more powerful athlete.
We’ve got so much more to offer, from unparalleled arm care methods using manual therapy, muscle energy techniques, wrist weight protocols, and specifically-tailored mobility drills to best-in-class velocity development programs using custom-manufactured weighted baseballs, but I think we’ve covered enough for now.
Visit us today and see why we’re the only training facility that blends hardcore science with hardcore training to develop elite pitchers.
cool looking stuff (love the 4 camera and the high speed one), but a few questions. what does a EMG sensor on your forearm tell you?
how do you determine the ideal force? there’s a limit on high you want it, but how do you know what that is?
where did you get the MLB pitch data and how are you normalizing it? for example, how can you tell FB up in-CH low away is really a dominant sequence or is it just tied into how that certain pitcher’s release point and movement profiles matched up to specific hitters? it seems like there are tons and tons of variables to account for there
An EMG sensor on the forearm measures medial forearm activity, specifically pronator-flexor mass activity.
“Ideal force” isn’t exactly what we’re after, but rather testing training modality effectiveness as well as the timing of the pronator-flexor mass muscle activity.
MLB pitch data can be spidered from MLBAM through the Gameday PITCHf/x sources. Just need to know how to write some code. As for your other questions, regression analyses and linear weights help a lot. I recommend reading Perry Husband’s Effective Velocity books as a good primer.
I’ll check that book out, thanks.
How are you using linear weights and regression analysis? are you taking linear weights of change-ups after fastballs, after curveballs, etc?  but my question was more about if you can tell say Kershaw’s FB/SL combo is dominant vs lefties, how does that specifically help a high school guy who doesn’t have pitches of that quality?
What does pronator-flexor mass activity tell you? I imagine you would see a spike at release but how do you use that?
and I didn’t make my original question about ideal force clear, I was talking about the force plates. how do you use those numbers?
thanks for the quick response, enjoy talking about this stuff
You can normalize for expected outcomes and check for deviations. This is outside of the scope of this blog, but I highly recommend checking out this method detailed on TangoTiger’s site:
https://www.insidethebook.com/ee/index.php/site/article/the_odds_ratio_method/
Pronator-flexor mass activity depends on timing (synchronizing with high-speed video/kinematic analysis) as well as the raw amplitude (%MVIC in this case).
Force plates will be / are used for a variety of activities. Bilateral vs. unilateral force comparison, landing leg force output, etc.
I still don’t see how you are taking the data from big-league pitches and bringing them to HS people. for example, analyzing Kershaw’s pitch data vs a certain hitter would help him vs similar hitters (and maybe all hitters) but how does it help a 16 year old with a 84 MPH and erratic offspeed?
and what are the standards for %MVIC and unilateral vs bilateral force? I understand you get numbers out of the force plates and EMG sensors but how can you tell what is good and what is bad?
For HS we are using a Pro Batter machine that can throw any pitch at any velocity at any location of the strike zone (with a video overlay on a screen) and measuring the results using high-speed video, bat accelerometers, and radar guns to record bat exit velocity. We are testing many high school, college, and pro hitters.
The truth is that most of our clients who we do this kind of analysis on aren’t worried about getting high school hitters out; the Pacific Northwest is not very challenging. A fastball at 90+ with any breaking ball is automatically dominant here, so there is no reason to focus/cater on the 84 MPH pitcher (indeed, pitchers here have to throw 85+ MPH before we focus on pitchability for any reasonable length of time). We focus on the college and pro game because these kids want to succeed there, not their local high school league.
As for your other questions, I can’t give away trade secrets! Unilateral is one-legged work, bilateral is two-legged work (in the context of ground reaction forces, anyway).
Hmm…. do I see some recoil in that overlay gif?

Early Results from The Dynamic Pitcher! - Driveline Baseball,2013-12-24T22:37:23+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2013/12/early-results-dynamic-pitcher/,"Update: Since the release of this post, our Dynamic Pitcher program has been updated and relaunched as Hacking the Kinetic Chain – Youth. The links have been updated, references to The Dynamic Pitcher have been swapped for Hacking the Kinetic Chain – Youth where appropriate.
Showtime Baseball 11U, run by Erik Noren, trains at the Driveline Baseball facility under our Hacking the Kinetic Chain – Youth program (formerly the The Dynamic Pitcher). Erik and I have talked on and off for a few months, and we finally decided to come to a partnership with 9 of his players, most of whom pitch. Erik loved our website and blog and wanted a science-based approach to training kids, rather than your average pitching coach who relies on what he hears or what he did when he played. As most of you know, Driveline Baseball’s training programs were all developed over constant iteration, experimentation, and science-based methods using the most state-of-the-art tools available (high-speed cameras, EMG sensors, multi-camera synchronized video analysis tools, manual therapy, etc).
As the Showtime Baseball team trends away from the pure arm strength portion of the program, we decided to record some velocities and results – and after two months, they’ve been staggering:
Yup – that’s an average gain of +3.78 MPH, and many of the pitchers complained of arm pain / fatigue before we started the program, and now NONE of them have a single complaint! We even had a pitcher touch 65 MPH the other day – and those results aren’t even factored into the above graph!
Results just keep rolling in day after day. We’re switching to the blended period where we are focusing on command/control, and the limited data shows that the kids are throwing more strikes than ever. Of course, like any responsible trainer/coach, I am recording all my results for future study and analysis. (Can your pitching coach say the same thing?)
There’s still time to add Hacking the Kinetic Chain – Youth to your off-season training program.
Progress update?

Weighted Baseball Training: Results from 2012 and a Case Study,2012-10-31T13:12:09+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2012/10/weighted-baseball-training-results-from-2012-and-a-case-study-daniel-gacke/,"About a year ago, I made my free ebook on weighted baseballs available to the public. Since then, we’ve had over 2,000 requests for the book, and many followed up on their results. Here’s a few of the responses I’ve gotten back:
I have followed your weighted baseball program with four of my students and I have had great success with increased velocity and overall arm strength. Great overall program and very well laid out, an excellent addition to my “toolbox.”
-Steve S.
It works. My god does it work! I’ve picked up 8mph according to my own radar gun. I don’t get injuries… which is the best part. Started at 83mph, now I’m Consistent at 91.
-K.C.
We loved the approach and we’re hoping to apply it internally in winter ball. Please let us know when your book on training pitchers is available.
-National Crosschecker for an MLB team
I integrated it into our offseason training program with good results. The best results came from our relievers, who picked up an average of 3.5 MPH. Starters responded OK to it and none lost velocity, but our closer and our bullpen guys really took to it. I think it’s because they have a far more aggressive mentality. Thanks!!
-Division-I Pitching Coach
No one has reported injuries or loss in velocity, and many of the responses started off with: “Well, I missed a few weeks, but gained X MPH anyway!”
Driveline Weighted Baseball Set
However, this blog post is about a special case study that warrants further explanation. Daniel Gacke responded to my initial request for feedback with this email on September 4th:
I am in the final week of phase 1, and my longest throw for long toss has increased by at least 30 feet, depending on the wind.  Throwing the over and under weight balls is fun, and has helped, but I feel the biggest factor in my distance increase has been improved rotational mechanics of my left hip (I am a righty thrower).
On October 11th, Daniel followed up with this email:
Anyhow, when I was healthy and in college, I sat in the 82-85 mph range, and the fastest I ever threw was 88 once.  Since my surgery, the fastest I’ve thrown was 82 until today.  I just got done throwing a 6 oz baseball 90 mph!  I would have thought it was a fluke, except that I also threw it 89 twice and 88 once.  Now for the interesting stuff.  My best throw with a 3 oz ball was 87, with a 4 oz ball was 86, and with a 5 oz also 86.  In addition, the first few throws I made for the Jugs were with the 5 oz, and I couldn’t top 79.  I was afraid at that point that all my hard work was wasted.  Then I picked up the 6 oz ball and threw, and the guy with the gun told me it was 86.  At first I thought it was wrong, but the next was 85, and the next was 89.  Then after throwing that ball, I went back to the 5 oz, and was consistently 82-84, with an 86.  Then after throwin the 4 oz and 3 oz afew times, Iwent back to the 6 oz, and hit 90 once.
He went on to say:
I’m wondering if the heavier weight is causing me to innately choose a more efficient movement pattern when I throw.  Throughout working on your program, I always thought it just felt better when I threw the heavier balls, particularly the 6 oz, and the results showed that.
This is a fairly common sentiment. Personally, of all the baseballs, I really like throwing the 6 oz. baseball (though I do not throw it as hard as a regulation 5 oz. baseball) and hate throwing the 3 oz. baseball. Most of the athletes in our MaxVelo Program feel the same way. Daniel was even able to throw a 6 oz. baseball at 90 MPH – yet could not do this with a regulation baseball!
Daniel’s case, while not uncommon, has some interesting elements to it. As a former college pitcher with a long history of injuries (SLAP tears, frayed supraspinatus, bone spurs, etc), it can feel like you cannot tap into all your velocity. There are two major factors working against him:
Very fine motor control develops over a long period of time when your brain has the strongest ability to acquire new skills. It’s why relearning how to walk is incredibly frustrating for those who suffer brain damage and is related to why it’s so hard to change your pitching mechanics once you reach the late high school level. A pitcher who has a long history of pitching with near-elite fastball velocities (upper 80’s) is going to have a predisposed way of throwing a baseball, and changing that pattern is going to be incredibly difficult.
When Daniel was in the high 70’s with a regulation baseball, I have no doubt he was reverting back to primary programming, which ultimately limited his velocity. He then picked up a foreign implement, threw it a few times, and then picked up a regulation baseball with that motor pattern imprinted in his brain – after which he was able to throw the ball 88-89 MPH! This is actually not a very common occurrence in most athletes; research suggests that this phenomenon is not widespread and is highly individualized (DeRenne, Blitzblau, et al). However, for athletes with a long history of slightly inefficient motor patterns, short-term “arm therapy” may prove to work.
Daniel’s history of debilitating shoulder injuries, surgeries, and long periods of rehabilitation have psychologically scarred him – regardless of whether or not he is conscious of it. This is the biggest hurdle for most post-op pitchers who had major reconstructive surgery (Tommy John, labrum anchors, rotator cuff reattachment, even cuff debridement) – the physical part of rehab generally goes well, and mentally they are able to compete, but psychologically they know that throwing a baseball is what injured them in the first place, so the brain puts on the brakes.
Getting over this hump is not easy. Throwing at elite velocities (90+ MPH) requires massive intent to throw the ball hard, and anything that limits this will cause a degradation in performance. Using variably weighted implements to improve arm action, timing, and the physiology of the arm (bone cortex hardening, thickening of tendons, increased overall external rotation, and increased strength in posterior shoulder muscles) may very well grant psychological benefits.
Our hypothesis is that pitchers are able to throw a slightly heavier baseball as hard (or harder) than a regulation baseball because of increased intent in the delivery. They know that the ball is heavier, so they tap into a reserve of intent to try to throw it harder – it’s basically as simple as that. While a heavier baseball does invoke a physiological stimulus and this stimulus is partially responsible for increased fastball velocity, a major part is the organic improvement to the throwing mechanics of the pitcher. The pitcher learns to throw a baseball more efficiently and with more intent with the heavier baseballs and learns to not “push” the baseball with the lighter ones.
A break in the kinetic chain where the hand leads the elbow into the driveline will be immediately felt with a 3 oz. baseball (hence why most people hate the lighter ball – this is the most common flaw in pitchers) while a lack of intent will cause a 6 or 7 oz. baseball to wildly miss the target inside.
I hate throwing this thing
Overall, Daniel had this to say:
I know you are on the cutting edge as far as researching the act of throwing, and I wondered if you had any insight on the reason for me throwing the 6 oz ball harder than the 5 oz.  If nothing else, you can take this as a ringing endorsement of you program.  If you do have any ideas, I would really love to hear them.
Well, Dan, I hope this helps. And thanks for the kind words!
For everyone else: Our free ebook on weighted baseball training is a great way to get started training with weighted baseballs!
Kyle,
Have you ever thought the increase in velo on a heavier ball is just due to it’s increased mass? If, acceleration = force/mass, then the body needs to produce more force to move that mass, and the small gain in mass (1oz), while not enough to hurt or drop acceleration, is also likely enough to keep velocity maintained against external forces (air resistance). While psych stuff and motor patterns are important, I don’t think they explain this concept well.
Chris McKenzie
Chris:
The body does not “need” to produce more force to move that mass. It needs to produce more force to
Empirically speaking, I’ve tested over 50+ people, and after sufficient familiarity with the implements, maybe 1 or 2 have been similar to Daniel. It is exceedingly unlikely that a normal mechanical model of throwing an implement would allow for a heavier object to be consistently thrown faster than a lighter object of same size.
Thanks, Kyle. I’m not trying to argue at all, please believe me. So out of your 50+ guys, did all of them throw the 3oz ball faster than the 5oz ball?
Yes, they did.
Momentum and inertia, in this example, would only apply to forces attempting to slow the ball down. At best, your theory would apply only to fingertips that hang onto the ball past its peak velocity.
A slightly heavier ball could force its way out of the hand slightly sooner than a normally weighted ball. This would seem to indicate a grip strength issue in the 2-3 pitchers that exhibit this odd velocity bump.
Perhaps Kyle will do some kinematic experiments on these three with differently weight balls in their hands. Are they releasing the heavier balls earlier? What about the control group (the guys who throw the normal balls harder)?
I have plans on doing just that and presenting it at Wolforth’s Coaches Bootcamp!
Hi Trip,
I think (not sure…haven’t looked at this) that max ball acceleration is achieved just after it is released from the hand, and velocity will remain constant or decrease from here. One of the forces acting to slow the ball down (excluding gravity) would likely be air resistance.
Where is the point on the mass:velocity curve when you can’t throw a lighter ball faster than a heavier one? Such as with a closed-window wiffle ball.
The ball will not accelerate after it leaves the hand because there is nothing left to accelerate it. Peak ball *velocity occurs during release shortly after the grip loosens (ball leaves the thumb or whatever finger is holding it in the hand). The ball escapes the hand when its forward momentum “pulls” it away from the fingertips of the pitcher. At that point, wind resistance is the only resistance the ball encounters, but since the ball has already left the hand, it can’t affect release velocity.
Now, if you’re suggesting that wind resistance plays enough of a roll in this situation to affect the pitcher’s arm speed, then I think you’re dramatically overestimating its role.
Trip,
I believe wind resistance does not impart it’s effect on the arm, but on the ball itself. Keep all conditions and external forces the same, including arm acceleration and radar gun placement; by the time a lighter ball (mass unknown, regarding mass:velocity continuum) reaches the electromagnetic waves of the radar gun, it has the potential to lose more velocity than a ball that carries greater mass.
Also, empirically speaking, only a very very small percentage of players/pitchers have the necessary strength and power in the posterior cuff that allow the body to fully impart all of it’s force. The posterior cuff needs to have great eccentric strength/power. If not, the posterior cuff gets “turned off” (via the golgi tendon organ) because too much tension is going through it and the glenohumeral joint becomes unstable, decreasing arm acceleration. To avoid this, most players needs to be specifically trained. Only a few have true natural eccentric strength. I’ll bet this is another factor why only a few players can reach max potential arm acceleration while  throwing a heavier ball faster…not wind resistance.
Chris McKenzie
I’m not even sure what you’re trying to say. Your original comment that I was responding to stated, “Velocity would decrease… as the mass of the ball decreases because it would carry less momentum and inertia.” I have been trying to refute/understand that statement because at its face, it does not make sense to me.
If you’re talking about final velocity or average flight velocity or radar measurement error or whatever else, then that’s fine, but those are issues beyond the pitcher’s control (outside of how he spins the ball, obviously) and do not seem to have anything to do with a pitcher’s force application techniques.
I just read through the comments here, and thought I’d throw my personal experience into the mix.  I’m not sure I understand Chris’s theory, but one thing that I can say for sure is that, from my perspective, the amount of effort and force that I was putting into the early 78-79 mph throws with the regulation 5 oz ball was exactly the same as what I was putting into the 88-90 mph throws with the 6 oz ball, the 87 mph with the 3 oz ball, and the 84-86 mph throws with the 5 oz ball after throwing the weighted balls.  All of them were flat out, “pedal to the floor” for me.  I was grunting.  To me, that was a sign that the issue is mechanical, or maybe as Kyle stated, unconsciously mental.  As for grip strength being an issue, I can tell you for sure that static grip strength isn’t an issue for me.  I grew up on a farm, and grip strength kind of comes with the territory there, because of the kind of work you do.  I can spin the dial all the way back around to zero on one of those hydraulic grip dynamometers.  Maybe it’s a different release point, or the grip strength expresses itself differently in a ballistic motion such as throwing.  Whatever the answer is, I’m determined to figure out how to take 90 mph out to the mound with me.  Either that or waterlog the baseballs before games, so I can throw them harder!
I had surgery for a torn labrum about 8 months ago, are weighted balls smart to use for rehabbing and strengthening my shoulder again?
This is something to approach a medical professional about. We are not medical professionals, but some physical therapists use similar modalities to rehab players.

Here are some articles on the Internet you should catch up on:
While I was pumping up Driveline Athletics client Jack Scheideman for nabbing 2nd in the 4A Washington State shot put championship (he’s salty about not winning it all), I completely slept on Driveline Baseball athlete Reid Martinez who’s panning center field for Yakima Valley CC. Reid finished in the top 25 of the entire NWAACC in batting average and was elected to the First Team Eastern Region All-Stars (warning: PDF) as a freshman. Hell of a job, buddy. Now get a better profile picture.
Nice mugshot, Reid.
Yikes.
Another shoutout goes to Driveline Baseball client David Holt, who has returned to baseball after a year off for the NSBA Pilots (18U). He threw 5 innings, striking out 7, hitting one batter, walking none, and giving up just 2 hits and a single earned run, picking up the win. His teammate – and fellow Driveline Baseball athlete – Eli Mathieu went 2-for-2 with a double, single, stolen base, RBI, and leaned into one in the same game.
I have a bunch of testimonials I’ll be adding over the next week, but since I mentioned Reid, I might as well post what he had to say about Driveline Baseball:
Kyle’s approach to baseball training is unlike anywhere else. He combines aspects of video analysis, scientific research, and weightlifting to make you the best player you can be. This research enables him to design workouts specifically geared towards what areas you are looking to improve and he does it in a very safe way that is about injury prevention just as much as it is about strength gains. The way he looks at the different aspects of the game allows him to objectively make decisions about what the best way to achieve your goal is. The environment in the cages and weight room is very supportive and everyone is always pushing you to get the most out of yourself.
Reid Martinez, CF, Freshman @ YVCC
Thanks, Reid. We’re looking forward to when you head back and start hitting the weights hard!

Here’s where you can catch up on some podcast interviews we’ve done, articles for other sites we’ve written, and some old stuff to re-read.
I should also mention that I spoke to Dylan Bundy’s (2011 MLB draft’s third pick) father (Denver Bundy, @denver_bundy on Twitter) for about 90 minutes the other day. We had a long chat about mechanics, training, and life, and his graciousness is only exceeded by his wealth of knowledge in those areas. Thanks again, Denver.
Speaking of Dylan Bundy, you should read this old THT article where I praised his workouts. How’s he been doing again in pro ball since Baltimore took him with the 4th pick of the draft?
You could call that “decent,” I guess.
We’ve also been super-active on our YouTube channel, including videos about our upcoming comprehensive book on training for fastball velocity.

How Research Plays a Role at Driveline Baseball - Driveline Baseball,2011-06-20T23:00:46+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/06/how-research-plays-a-role-at-driveline-baseball/,"We pride ourselves on trying to keep up with all the latest research in biomechanics and kinesiology as it relates to baseball athletes. Most traditional coaches out there have little to no knowledge of published research on pitching biomechanics, but at Driveline Baseball we think it’s important to stay on top of both the research being done in the labs and the work being put out in the trenches of the strength and conditioning community.
Additionally, we’re currently planning research studies for Fall 2011 of our own, including more tests of our Biomechanical Video Analysis services. Few coaches out there can say that they are using a biomechanical lab to complete their own research on pitching mechanics.
Here’s a short list of selected research papers we’ve read, digested, and have helped form our theories on how we coach and train pitchers.

Our Motion Capture Lab: The Overview - Driveline Baseball,2011-06-06T19:00:36+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/06/our-motion-capture-lab-the-overview/,"Since the weather’s gotten a bit better, we’ve decided to do our high-speed biomechanical analysis filming outside. Matthew (my research assistant) and I took the equipment outside where we continued progress on our three-dimensional filming model.
Taking it outside
Today, we filmed a few different movement patterns:
For those unaware of how it works, we reconstruct our control object of precisely known size and put it where we want to capture the motion.
Control Object
We then chalk the corners of the object, indicating the boundaries of where we can film. After that, we film the cube from the number of high-speed cameras we’ll be using. By doing this, each camera is then calibrated with the specific locations of the cube. The cameras will not move from these positions while the trials are being filmed.
Filming Area
We then film the subject performing whatever motion we want to analyze, using all of our high-speed cameras.
[youtube 1bCUGf-97Gc nolink]
And lastly, we’ll digitize the two-dimensional video files, creating a three-dimensional model from the video files. We then have kinematics we can store in a database for future analysis and a three-dimensional skeletal model we can use for coaching and training purposes for the athlete.
Sample Lab Results
We’ve improved the process a number of times, making setup much quicker. We can deploy the motion capture lab at a mobile site in under an hour, and then film test subjects all day. This makes our lab setup ideal for filming pitchers in competition without being intrusive – no external markers are necessary on the athlete.

Finishing Up Off-Season Training: Some Results - Driveline Baseball,2011-03-03T00:36:10+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/03/finishing-up-off-season-training-some-results/,"The off-season is wrapping up and high school tryouts are underway – despite the bad weather in Seattle! Our athletes are reporting to tryouts stronger, more powerful, and in the best shape of their lives. As I talked about in Some Results From the Velocity Development Program, our guys have seen some great jumps in fastball velocity. Here’s a summary of how our athletes have done in that regard:
Eli jumped from 75 MPH to 81 MPH – while on a badly sprained right ankle! We look forward to the numbers he’s going to put up when he is fully healthy. Our goals for him are to be consistently at 83-84 MPH on the mound heading into his freshman year of college baseball at a bodyweight of 185-190 pounds. (He is 5’11”.)
Velocity Development Kit
Here’s what Travis’s mother had to say about her son’s gains during the training period:
I went to Travis’s team practice this weekend at the cages, wow I could really see a difference in Travis’s hitting and pitching!  He looked awesome and the speed on his fastball was visibly improved.  I look forward to seeing him run and see the improvement in his speed as well.
Everyone’s taking a week or so off to deload and then will be back at it, training hard during the season. How we manage athletes in-season is different than the off-season, but they still train hard and we expect them to make strength, power, and sport-specific gains throughout the spring and summer seasons.

Some Results from the Velocity Development Program - Driveline Baseball,2011-02-04T22:00:28+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2011/02/some-results-from-the-velocity-development-program/,"I’m working on the Strength and Power post of the Velocity Development Program and it will go up on Monday morning. But I just got back from the facility tonight, and everyone had such a great workout and we had some great results from our first cycle of the Velocity Development Program that I wanted to share it on the blog.
I matched my previous power clean one-rep max (1RM) today set a few months ago. This wouldn’t be that exciting except that I set that 1RM a few months ago at 40 pounds heavier than I am now! I trained through my novice progression at 260-265 pounds while training as a powerlifter, then cut to 220 pounds over the past few months. My first attempt at 205 pounds went up smoothly.
Our shot put / discus athlete, Jack, refused to be out done – so he tried. And failed. And failed. And failed. He made at least 24 separate attempts to power clean 205 pounds (he weighs 215) and then was able to get it. That’s the kind of dedication we love around here at Driveline Baseball. I stayed late at the facility for him, giving him coaching tips and killing the time by doing some more medball and mobility work. We support our athletes here 100%.
Eli, our 17-year old pitcher/shortstop that’s been training with me for years, set yet another deadlift record. He pulled two sets of three at 355 pounds – and he weighs just 165 pounds! (At least he tells me that – I think he weighs less!)
Check out his second rep of his first set here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR1gA4G2iug
Our 15-year old shortstop, Ted, came to us two months ago with a pretty compact swing but had trouble making solid contact. His mechanics were clean, but his approach needed to be tweaked – he was pulling off pitches and just didn’t have the bat speed and strength to find great success. After two months of hard training – including squats, deadlifts, chin-ups, medball work, and metabolic conditioning – Ted was smoking baseballs left and right in the batting cage today with both wood and metal. It was actually scary to throw batting practice to him, and it’s a testament to how hard he has been working.
I’ll let the numbers speak for themselves for our younger guys:
Entry Velocities (December 2010)
-Alex M: 61 MPH (12 years old)
-Travis T: 58 MPH (13 years old)
-Ted W: 63 MPH (15 years old)
Exit Velocities (February 2011)
-Alex M: 63 MPH (+2)
-Travis T: 63 MPH (+5)
-Ted W: 71 MPH (+8)
Enough said.
As the off-season finishes up, you might think you don’t have the opportunity to train hard. Not so. We have an in-season semi-private training group coming up. The low cost option gives you a chance to start your strength/power program while adding some MPH to your fastball and bat speed while not overworking yourself. Contact us for more details.
Tons of things are going right at Driveline Baseball. Come join us, train hard, and become the best baseball player you can be.

What Causes Tommy John Surgery,2010-08-27T23:31:12+00:00,https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/2010/08/elbow-injuries-and-what-causes-tommy-john-surgery/,"Before we get into the mechanical analysis and discussion on what causes UCL rupture, I want to visit a quote by the Nationals’ General Manager, Mike Rizzo:
Was Strasburg injured on one pitch or was this from wear and tear? Rizzo called the earlier MRIs on Strasburg “pristine,” then said:
“I listen to the opinion of the doctors and they feel it was probably a one-pitch event. The MRI we took [Thursday] was dramatically changed from the MRI we took when we drafted him.”
Yes, it’s true that the changeup that he threw was the pitch that caused the rupture in his ulnar collateral ligament, but it was not the only thing that caused the issue. Single pitches do not rupture ligaments and cause elbow injuries and Tommy John surgery – the UCL is torn microscopically over time in a flawed pitching delivery. Let’s please dispel this notion that a single pitch thrown incorrectly caused the injury.
To discuss Stephen Strasburg’s UCL rupture injury (and the injuries of every pitcher before him with a similar injury), we must understand what causes UCL rupture and leads to Tommy John surgery. Here’s how Medscape describes it:
In other words, as the forearm lays back in external rotation and reaches Maximum External Rotation (MER), valgus stress is pulling the bones in the elbow apart while the UCL stabilizes it. Over time, this can cause the UCL to tear and eventually rupture.
Another interesting phrase in that description is:
That’s right – the valgus stress that pitchers experience in their elbows often exceeds the measured strength of the UCL in cadavers! So, how is it possible to pitch without suffering traumatic injury every single time out there? In Biomechanics of the elbow during baseball pitching by Werner et al., they conclude that:
Triceps, wrist flexorpronator, and anconeus activity during peak valgus stress suggests that these muscles may act as dynamic stabilizers to assist the ulnar collateral ligament in preventing valgus extension overload.
The idea that the surrounding muscles can support the UCL and prevent injury is nothing new, but one that is often ignored by pitching coaches around the world. Strength training has a positive benefit on injury prevention as well as performance!
For more information on the ulnar collateral ligament, Dr. James Buffi wrote a whole series of articles profiling how the muscles in the arm protect the elbow, why overuse might not be the issue when it comes to elbow injuries in baseball, and the role of forearm pronation in limiting elbow injuries.
If you are recovering from a pitching injury or trying to find a pitching program that minimizes your risk of injury, get in touch and we can help you find a program that’s right for you and your goals.
If elbow valgus stress is responsible for elbow pain, UCL damage and Tommy John surgery, then it makes sense that we should seek to limit it when possible, right? Well, not necessarily. As with most complex systems, the neuromuscular system is not a single-input single-output machine. Reducing one variable that correlates with injury could theoretically reduce fastball velocity, and this wouldn’t necessarily be a good thing. For example: We know that torque around the shoulder increases the chance of injury but also increases fastball velocity, and vice versa.
A groundbreaking paper was published in 2002 titled Relationship between throwing mechanics and elbow valgus in professional baseball pitchers (Werner et al.) and it sought to correlate variables with elbow valgus. Here is the abstract of the paper (emphasis mine):
Valgus elbow stress leads to medial tension and lateral compression injuries in baseball pitchers of all ages. This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between elbow stress in professional baseball pitchers and the kinematic parameters of pitching mechanics. This was done in an attempt to understand valgus extension overload better and in an effort to improve preventive and rehabilitative protocols. High-speed video data were collected on 40 professional pitchers in game situations during the 1998 and 1999 Cactus League season in Arizona, as part of Major League Baseball Spring Training. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to relate elbow valgus to kinematic parameters of pitching mechanics. The resulting analysis produced an adjusted multiple R2 value of 0.974, indicating that nearly 100% of the variance in valgus stress on the elbow was explained by the parameters in the regression equation. This ability to explain over 97% of the variance in valgus stress is significant. The parameters of pitching mechanics related to elbow valgus may be assessed and optimized, if necessary, in order to decrease the magnitude of elbow stress in pitching.
The variables that correlated with elbow valgus were:
Werner et al. measured thirty-seven (37) total variables, including ball velocity, max hip angular velocity, trunk tilt angle, and stride length. The four variables above were responsible for 97% of the variance in elbow valgus stress. Though cause and effect relationships can’t be made based on regression analyses, this is an excellent starting point when discussing how to reduce elbow valgus stress in pitchers. Note that ball velocity was NOT a significant variable!
Combining this study with my favorite research paper on baseball throwing – Humeral Torque in Professional Baseball Pitchers (Sabick et al.) – gives you a baseline of what specific mechanics can lead to high rates of elbow valgus stress and high rates of humeral loading. Let’s talk about one of those variables above, what it means, and how we can possibly alter someone’s mechanics to reduce elbow valgus stress.
Peak Shoulder Horizontal Adduction Angular Velocity
Shoulder horizontal adduction is best described as the action you perform when you are doing dumbbell flys:
The phrase “peak shoulder horizontal adduction angular velocity is correlated with elbow valgus stress” is a fancy way of saying that the faster the arm moves in that pattern, the more elbow valgus stress you get. So, what mechanical cues can increase this value? Well, “scapular loading” is one of them.
When the arm is taken behind the body in this position, it must return to the neutral/anterior portion of the trunk to deliver the ball to the plate. As a result, this will cause peak shoulder horizontal adduction angular velocity to increase, which causes elbow valgus to increase.
“Scapular loading” is a popular term first posited as a mechanical cue that would help improve fastball velocity by Paul Nyman of SETPRO. While he has since taken down his website, you can find this quote on it using The Wayback Machine (all typos his):
Fact: SETPRO was the first to sunderstand and show the difference between HORIZONTAL ADDUCTION or what SETPRO call “SCAPULA LOADING” and HYPEFLEXING. Almost all power pitchers SCAPULA LOAD. SCAPULA LOADING is vital to developing stretch reflex, storage of elastic energy and increasing the Range Of Motion (ROM) of the delivery.
Paul Nyman himself says that scapular loading is horizontal adduction (technically it’s horizontal abduction followed by fast horizontal adduction during the acceleration phase) and that he teaches it to all of his clients as it is vital to “developing stretch reflex.” That’s a story for another blog post, but the end result is absolutely clear: Scapular loading causes higher rates of peak shoulder horizontal adduction angular velocity and therefore causes greater elbow valgus, which we know is positively correlated with UCL rupture.
As we described above, high rates of peak shoulder horizontal adduction angular velocity are correlated with elbow valgus and injury. One way to get these high rates is to intentionally force the elbows behind the body in a position of “scapular loading” so the arm must return from behind the body to the front of it to deliver the ball.
Yes, Strasburg has a lot of “scapular loading” going on in his delivery. Let’s turn to the animated GIF to see it in action:
Strasburg vs. Phillies
I’m not saying that the large amount of “scapular loading” is solely responsible for Stephen Strasburg’s UCL rupture requiring Tommy John surgery, but it’s definitely one of the variables that contributed to high elbow valgus stress in his motion.
At Driveline Baseball, we use high-speed video to measure these kinematic variables to build our pitchers a better, more efficient, and safer delivery. If you want to train in a way that both maximizes your results, reduces arm pain and minimizes your risk for injury, we have options for both local and remote athletes and coaches.

Nice site.
[…] the elbow can help reduce the load the anterior band of the UCL takes on. I wrote a lot about this with regards to Stephen Strasburg – in Dr. Werner’s paper Biomechanics of the elbow during pitching, she wrote:Triceps, […]
Baseball pitchers should never bring their throwing elbow behind their acromial line. (The imaginary line that runs from one shoulder through the spinal column and through the opposite shoulder).
They should should swing their arm down, back and up to a postion with their elbow behind them at about ear height with their throwing hand a little higher, pointing toward second base,
If you look at these guys who have injuries, their arms form an “M” when they scapula load. The pitchers who have long careers all form a “W” with their arms when they scapula load.
If I wanted to read pseudoscience from Chris O’Leary, I’d Google it myself.
I too have read Dr. Marshall’s site. Thanks for the summary.
[…] Elbow Injuries and What Causes Them (bonus Stephen Strasburg content) […]
I have also heard that if your throwing arm isn’t within 90 degrees at front foot strike it can put more stress on elbow. Someone called it forearm fly out. Is that true? I had tommy John and mine used to be beyond 90 degrees at front foot. I notice all of your clients seem to get it within. Love your work!
There has been some research that suggests that having more elbow flexion when in external rotation does reduce valgus torque on the elbow. (You can read more here: drivelinebaseball.comm/pitching-research , under the mechanics section). At the same time studies looking at mechanics and injury rates have been largely inconclusive. So had to say conclusively what the ‘right’ answer is.
