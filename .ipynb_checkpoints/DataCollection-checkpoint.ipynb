      "Hunter Hoopes was hired as a Performance Coach, but 2 weeks after starting, he hit an all-time high velocity, sitting 98-100 mph in a bullpen and nearly set the world record for the fastest baseball ever thrown, shuffling 107+ MPH in his warm-ups for that bullpen.\n",
      "Needless to say, he signed a minor league contract with the Twins shortly thereafter.\n",
      "He was shifted to a part-time Facilities Manager for the offseason as his playing career continues this Spring.\n",
      "You could say that the video of this bullpen went viral. Here it is if you missed it:\n",
      "In all, the team is now eclipsing 75 members – and we’re excited about the extremely impressive level of talent relocating to Charlotte to start their Tread careers and help athletes re-write their stories.\n",
      "Last year, Dr. James Werner joined us as our Director of Rehab here at our headquarters in Charlotte, NC.\n",
      "He’s had his plate full, serving as a point of contact for both in-house and remote athletes and helping revamp our return to throw & rehabilitation protocols.\n",
      "Dr. Werner’s one-on-one sessions have remained 100% included with our training and in-house fees, providing a unique amenity that few other training facilities offer.\n",
      "We also invested in additional tools that will allow us to level up rehab within the baseball world.\n",
      "Specifically, we added a Diagnostic Ultrasound, allowing us to get real-time, dynamic imaging and functional measurements of athletes’ ligaments (i.e. UCLs), tendons, fascia, nerves, and more.\n",
      "Not only have we begun using it to monitor athletes’ UCL health and function, but here’s a cool case study of how Dr. Werner was able to use it to diagnose and fix an athlete’s arm pain.\n",
      "Check that out here:\n",

      "If you’re interested in rehabbing with Tread, contact us here to learn more.\n",
      "In 2023, we purchased and set up a Biomechanics Lab and got to work collecting data.\n",
      "This year, we added a key piece in Courtney Semkewyc, PhD, who is our lead biomechanist and helps run our Data department.\n",
      "We also added Mound Force Plates to our Pitching Lab to assess ground forces in the delivery, weight room Force Plates to assess lower body power output (and more), as well as other strength testing equipment to better understand how our athletes move, how they produce force, and to identify any injury red flags when they visit Tread HQ.\n",
      "As we continue to collect 1000’s of unique Motion Capture sessions per year and pair this with relevant performance data, injury history, UCL screening, pitch metrics, and more, we will be uniquely positioned in several years with what will likely be the largest and most comprehensive data set on elite baseball pitchers in the world (including Major League Baseball).\n",
      "I discussed my thoughts on MLB Elbow Injuries on Twitter/X and in an interview with MLB Network Radio.\n",
      "One of my conclusions was that we simply need more data – and lots of it – to better understand as an industry exactly where the risk/reward tradeoffs lie from a training, workload, and preparation standpoint.\n",
      "Expect this data set – and the insights we will be able to derive from it – to have massive implications for the baseball world as a whole over the next decade.\n",
      "As the game works to continue increasing player performance—while also limiting arm injuries—Tread expects to remain at the forefront of this conversation.\n",
      "In 2023, 13 of our remote athletes were drafted, 48 signed free agent deals, 8 debuted in the MLB and 2 were named All-Stars.\n",
      "We managed to match or eclipse all of these in 2024 – just barely, as the bar continues to get set higher and higher each year (see our full list of signs & draft picks here).\n",
      "Debuts included Ben Casparius (Dodgers), Spencer Bivens (Giants), Gordon Graceffo (Cardinals), James Meeker (Brewers), Cade Povich (Orioles), Brady Basso (Athletics), Robert Gasser (Brewers), and Landon Knack (Dodgers).\n",
      "We also had 3 World Series Champs in Ben Casparius & Landon Knack, both rookies, as well as Anthony Banda, who at this time last year was a Free Agent throwing in our Annual Pro day.\n",
      "If you don’t think a lot can happen in 12 months, just ask these guys.\n",
      "Notably, Spencer Bivens’ story received quite a bit of media attention.\n",
      "After going undrafted and bouncing around Europe and Indy leagues for 4 years, he ultimately was able to go from 90-92 to 94-97 in an off-season with Tread and get signed by the Giants before debuting this year at 29 years old.\n",
      "Here he is describing what his first big league start meant to him, in which he struck Shohei Ohtani out…twice.\n",
      "\"I was not a prospect of any kind…that was such a huge moment for me.\"Reflecting on some of the best moments of the year, and you can't forget this one.Spencer Bivens played at a DII in college.He went undrafted and bounced around Europe and Indy leagues for 4 years.In… pic.twitter.com/tDz9w6n8Bo\n",
      "In addition to these MLB Debuts, we also had 3 remote athletes selected as All-Stars – Cole Ragans, Tanner Scott, and Clay Holmes (2x), all of whom have radically transformed their careers with Tread to become some of the best pitchers in baseball.\n",
      "Since starting with Tread:\n",
      "Before Tread, the three had a combined 0.1 career Wins Above Replacement (WAR), meaning they had been performing like average and replaceable big league pitchers.\n",
      "After Tread, they have combined for +16.9 WAR, a cumulative estimated value in free agency of $99 million.\n",
      "Pitching development is cool.\n",
      "(Clay Holmes just signed a 3-year, $38 million dollar contract, with Scott projected to get an even bigger deal this offseason, so these numbers are very real).\n",
      "In 2020, Clay Holmes emailed us with a 5.91 ERA & -0.9 career WAR.In 2022, Cole Ragans had just logged a 4.95 ERA & averaged 92 mph w/ -0.1 career WAR.When Tanner Scott reached out, he had a career ERA of 4.61 & a 6-year WAR of 1.1.A 🧵 on how all three became All-Stars ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/EXMrEMM8xL\n",
      "While there are too many to recount here, we post weekly stories on our social media throughout the year.\n",
      "Here are a few that stand out:\n",
      "With over 2,000 athletes, this list is just the tip of the iceberg, so make sure to follow our social media accounts for weekly updates of many more athletes.\n",
      "This thread by Tread’s Assistant Director of Performance Leif Strom sent shockwaves through the baseball world earlier this year, as he described what Tread calls the “Kick Change.”\n",
      "While studying slow-mo film of some of the best changeups in baseball, he happened across a slo-mo clip of Tread’s Shaun Anderson, who appeared to spike the middle finger and create incredible movement without pronating the pitch.\n",
      "While some pointed out that Spiked Changeups have been thrown before, it is an exceptionally rare grip that is virtually nowhere to be found at the higher levels of baseball, largely because nobody had described the why (why would you want to spike it?) or the how (how to consistently teach and throw it).\n",
      "I mean, just take a look at this Kick-Change from remote athlete Michael Forret, which reached -10.9″ of vertical break (that’s more depth than most curveballs).\n",
      "For reference, Devin Wiliams’ changeup, dubbed “The Airbender“, and widely regarded as one of the best of all time, only reached below -10″ of break twice in 2024.\n",
      "These are absolutely unheard-of numbers for a changeup, much less one that can be taught in a couple bullpen sessions, and few are able to emulate how Devin Williams throws his, which requires outlier pronation to pull off.\n",
      "It didn’t take long for the pitch to catch on.\n",
      "This is a pitch that has had tons of success with current Tread athletes, and we expect it to continue gaining popularity into 2025 and beyond.\n",
      "Not only can it add 6-12 inches of depth to many pitchers’ existing changeups, but it can be thrown without forcing pronation, making it easier to teach and throw, especially for pitchers who struggle with pronation.\n",
      "You can learn more about the pitch here.\n",

      "College pitchers who train with Tread are eligible to throw in this event, where we collect professional video and data to be shared with college coaches, who either physically attend or opt-in to receive this info online.\n",
      "It was a huge success.\n",
      "Between attendees and opt-ins, over 90 schools were represented at the event.\n",
      "All in all, 61 out of 65 participants found a school by the fall.\n",
      "Schools that physically attended had a huge advantage, with some players setting up visits before leaving the building.\n",
      "As the Transfer Portal continues to be a bigger and bigger piece of College Baseball, we only expect this event to grow and be a destination for both College coaches looking to land talent and Tread’s growing list of college arms.\n",

      "Up until this point, other facilities have always charged anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000 for this service.\n",
      "We decided to instead make our entire in-house assessment process free for Pros.\n",
      "This created waves through the baseball world, with dozens of players scrambling to reschedule their early offseason plans to come to Tread\n",
      "This included Force plate and dynamometer reports, Biomechanical reports, body composition testing, UCL imaging, arsenal reporting with slow-motion video and follow-ups to discuss the results with our staff.\n",
      "In all, over 50 pro pitchers took us up on the offer, saving them an estimated $100,000 – $200,000 on Motion Capture fees elsewhere.\n",
      "One of my favorite reactions was a message from a AAA coach to our staff:\n",
      "“What’s the catch?”\n",
      "Our response: there is no catch.\n",
      "Sure, many players were so impressed that they chose to begin training with Tread, but for those who were already comfortable with their training programming, we happily ran them through the process – no questions asked.\n",
      "As the word continues to spread, we expect more and more athletes to come see what we have going on in Charlotte, NC, and who knows?\n",
      "We may even extend this offer to college players in 2025.🤔\n",
      "What do we have in store for 2025? While there are some projects we can’t announce yet, here are a few goals we can discuss:\n",
      "I also wanted to take the time to thank our team – and especially our Co-Founder and CEO, Coan McAlpine, for everything he does behind the scenes to help make Tread what it is today.\n",
      "Tread exists to help athletes re-write their stories. Now it’s time to double down on that mission in 2024.\n",
