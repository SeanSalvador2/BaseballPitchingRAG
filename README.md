# Baseball Pitching RAG Chatbot

## Project Overview  
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** designed to assist baseball players, coaches, and enthusiasts with **elite-level pitching training** insights. The chatbot leverages **high-quality public resources** commonly used by professional and collegiate athletes to provide accurate and actionable training advice.

## Step-by-Step Process  

1. **Data Collection** – Gather publicly available high-quality baseball training articles, blogs, and research papers.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, format, and structure the text for efficient retrieval.  
3. **Embedding Generation** – Convert text chunks into vector embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.  
4. **Vector Storage** – Store embeddings in FAISS/Pinecone for fast similarity search.  
5. **Query Processing** – Convert user questions into vector embeddings for efficient lookup.  
6. **Information Retrieval** – Fetch the most relevant baseball training insights from the vector database.  
7. **LLM Response Generation** – Pass the retrieved content into an LLM (GPT-4, LLaMA, etc.) to generate a coherent response.  
8. **Chatbot Interaction** – Return structured responses to users through a chat interface (CLI, Streamlit, React, etc.).  
9. **Evaluation & Optimization** – Test chatbot responses for accuracy and refine retrieval methods as needed.  
10. **Future Enhancements** – Expand with video analysis, personalized training recommendations, and voice integration.
